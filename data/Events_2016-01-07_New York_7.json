Humanity has continued to set these laws into creative motion through thoughts, prayers, motives, intentions, voices, and beliefs.\u00a0These are the right tools. In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true-all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work. This is your guide to put these concepts into practice in our troubled world today!<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/226189722\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"The Plan","id":"fpbtflytqbnc","time":1451518200000,"updated":1451530350000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Mystics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"1054 Bedford Ave","name":"Naliaka's Crib Apt 2","lon":-73.955307,"id":23529976,"state":"NY","lat":40.688892,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":4.60586977005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":18,"created":1449859811000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":3.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We did this last year and it was a magical dream!

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

If the title doesn't say it all, I don't know what will! To preface this review, all of you naysayers out there who shake their heads at sci-fi should remember that, back in the 70's, the names R2-D2, C3PO, Chewie...you get my point, here...were unknowns. Now they are as much a facet of popular literary culture as is Mr. Darcy. Jane Austen, Henry James, Dickens, etc., were beautiful storytellers, but sci-fi has amazingly imaginative beauty surrounding it as well. And this author, Vlane Carter, knows that for a fact....\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0...there are A LOT of scenes that the reader gets to experience. From the military battle with the UFO, to the alien shark attack on another planet (which is really cool, by the way), this author offers a never-ending parade of amazing creatures and locations that will, perhaps, one day be logged into popular literary culture right beside old C3PO and his little beeping buddy...<\/p> <p>...There are two factions out there in America - Star Wars vs. Star Trek - and I am definitely on the side of George Lucas having the more creative concept. So hats off to this writer, Vlane Carter, who may someday join those Lucas ranks if readers and sci-fi fans everywhere band together and realize that the force really MAY be with this one.\" \u2013 FEATHERED QUILL REVIEWS.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPrologue:\u00a0<\/p> <p>A young man by the name of Jaden is abducted by benevolent aliens, bio-engineered to superhuman levels and sent back to Earth years later to stop an alien invasion.<\/p> <p>150,000 years ago Darclonians began on an experimental dark energy\/dark matter weapon that works only with carbon based life forms.

We believe strongly that we were able to achieve this by making this celebration available for only $125.00 (includes tax and gratuities) per person . Better still is that this early reservation price is locked in until Friday December 18th, giving everyone ample time to participate!

We'll also help celebrate the launch of Paddy's 30th anniversary year celebrations.<\/p> <p>A fixture on the New York Irish pub scene since 1986 (though it opened a block south of its current location), Paddy Reilly's, originally owned by Paddy Reilly himself,\u00a0is where artists like Black 47, Cherish the Ladies, Eileen Ivers, The Prodigals, The McCabes, and The Mickey Finns first got their start before becoming household names in national and international Irish and world music circles. The Prodigals remain in Friday night residency at Paddy's and are the entertainment on this night.<\/p> <p>Until recently, Paddy Reilly's was the only all-Guinness draft pub in the world. They've since expanded their offerings but the iconic and unique 8 taps of Guinness--one for every letter--remain.

North Jersey Ramapo Chapter hikes are rated for pace (A, B or C), mileage, and terrain (A, B or C), with \"C\" designating easier hikes and \"A\" more challenging ones. We recommend that new hikers should first try a \"C\" or short \"B\" hike before undertaking a more difficult one; otherwise, you may not fully enjoy the hiking experience. If you have any doubts, please contact the hike leader in advance.<\/p> <p><b><i>Pace Ratings: <\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Fast - 2.5 mph or faster<br\/>B = Moderate - about 2 mph<br\/>C = Easy - 1.5 mph or less<\/p> <p><b><i>Distance:<\/i><\/b>Noted in miles<\/p> <p><b><i>Terrain Ratings:<\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Strenuous, long\/steep climbs and descents,<br\/>possible rock scrambling<br\/>B = Moderate climbs and descents<br\/>C = Generally flat with little elevation change<\/p> <p>For example, a hike rated \u201cB-7-A\u201d is a moderately paced hike of approximately 7 miles with steep climbs and\/or descents and possible rock scrambling.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike, please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness, including ensuring that the hike is appropriate for your level of fitness, that you wear the proper clothing, and bring the proper gear, food and water (see the ADK's recommended <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adk.org\/page.php?pname=hiking-essentials\"><b>Hiking Essentials<\/b><\/a> and guidelines, below).<\/p> <p>Leaders have the right, responsibility and sole discretion to refuse any hiker he\/she deems to be not properly attired, prepared, or otherwise fit to safely complete the hike.<\/p> <p><b>HIKERS' GUIDELINES:<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Risks:<\/b><\/i> As with all physical activities, hiking involves hazards.

Jan 1st (Friday)<\/b><\/p> <p>Hey gang,<br\/>The First event of the New Year: \"FREEZE yourself from the past\" (LITERALLY) and plunge into the Atlantic Ocean as we swim with the Polar Bears Club!!<\/p> <p>Ha! If the last couple of days are any indication, we may even enjoy beautiful beach weather! Always wanted to try the Polar Bear Swim, but never had it in you??? NOW IS YOUR CHANCE!<\/p> <p>The annual polar bear swim is a world famous event organized by Brooklyn's Coney Island Polar Bear Club (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org<\/a><\/a>). Each New Years Day, they attract hundreds of swimmers and spectators for one of the biggest winter beach parties imaginable. If you love challenges (or you just want a good laugh), come meet us there!\u00a0<br\/>We should get anywhere from 20-30 psycho JOC'ers for this event. With a little luck, we'll be on TV!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Organizer(s):<br\/>Avi Golden (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Moshe Wolcowitz (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>SO WHAT EXACTLY GOES ON?<br\/>We will be meeting on Sunday, January 1, 2016 at 12pm at the Coney Island beach in Brooklyn in front of the Wonder Wheel Ferris wheel on the boardwalk. The polar bear plunge officially begins at 12:45PM, but we are meeting earlier so that we can go as a group to the water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>SO HOW DO I GET THERE?<br\/>It's easy. Just take the subway to the Coney Island Stillwell Ave stop (D, F, N, or Q subway line), and when you leave the subway walk towards the beach (checkout driving and subway direction by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maps.google.com\/\">www.maps.google.com<\/a>)\u00a0if you plan on driving to the following nearby address: Nathans Famous restaurant, 1310 Surf Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11224). At the intersections of Surf &amp; Stillwell Ave, you will follow Stillwell Ave till then end and you will see the boardwalk, and as you walk along it, you'll see the wheel. It's a short walk so don't worry.<\/p> <p>Feel free to use this wall as a forum for ride share. However, keep in mind that given the traffic in the area, arriving by subway is by far the preferred method of travel.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>WHAT SHOULD I BRING?<br\/>If you would like to swim, you'll need to bring lots of warm clothing, a towel, a hat, water shoes, and waterproof bags to store your wet gear. Please note: The sand is going to be cold so be sure to bring water shoes or your feet will freeze.<\/p> <p>WHERE CAN I CHANGE?<br\/>There are changing rooms and restrooms at the beach.<\/p> <p>WHAT'S THE COST?\u00a0<br\/>As we like to say, IT'S FREE TO FREEZE, BABY!<\/p> <p>WHAT IF I DIE OF PNEUMONIA?<br\/>Our club has no money, so a lawsuit is pointless. Ok, seriously, it's a common myth that you can get sick from being cold.\u00a0<br\/>According to the American Lung Association, the flu and colds are only more common in the winter months because that is when the viruses spread across the country. Additionally, the event will have numerous life guards, and we will only be swimming for a few minutes (some people run into the water and run right out) so there is very little risk of hypothermia. In fact, the Coney Island Polar Bear Club cannot recall a single case of anyone ever developing hypothermia, and people have been taking the plunge at Coney Island for over a hundred years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>YEAH, BABY!! SEE YA IN THE OCEAN!!!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Avi &amp; Moshe!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"closest address is 1310 Surf Ave on the Board Walk (near the Ferris wheel)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jewish-Outdoors-Club\/events\/227664034\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":6300000,"name":"JOC Polar Bear Swim!!!","id":"227664034","time":1451667600000,"updated":1451675071000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1380727221000,"name":"The Jewish Outdoors Club","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10521162,"urlname":"Jewish-Outdoors-Club","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"JOCers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.04737043381,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1427428358000,"fee":{"amount":7,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For our Fall\/Winter sessions, we shall play with only 2 TEAMS<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Teams will be 7 a-side, 6 outfield players, a sub, and a goal keeper.<\/p> <p>\u2022 We play for an hour and half.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Lime green colored pinnies (practice jerseys) will be provided for one of the teams to diffrentiate teams.<\/p> <p>Please signup ASAP and may the force be with you :)<\/p> <p>Disclaimer: By taking part in group activities you hereby are agreeing to the rules and regulation of the meetup.

The organizer for this Meetup event is John, the Event Host, who is listed on the top of the \"going list\" with a photograph. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Description<\/b>:\u00a0We'll first go past the \"Blue Christmas house,\" where all the outdoor decorations are mostly in blue (not the traditional Christmas colors of red, green, and gold), which honors the divided household-a Christian husband and a Jewish wife. Inside, half of the house is decorated for Christmas; the other half is decorated for Hanukkah.<\/p> <p>We'll\u00a0also see an 800-pound robotic Santa Claus (he sometimes will have a conversation with you!), merry-go-rounds, Nativity scenes, stately trees bejeweled in colorful lights, inflatable figures, enormous wooden soldiers, dancing animals, candy canes, twinkling snowflakes, and much more.<\/p> <p>One interesting house has holiday greetings illuminated in three languages: English, Italian, and Greek.\u00a0On the side of the house,\u00a0a large snowflake design\u00a0periodically lights up as\u00a0a\u00a0Star of David. This house is incredible!<\/p> <p><b>How the Dyker Heights' holiday light tradition\u00a0got started:<\/b><\/p> <p>In the mid-1980s,\u00a0Lucy Spata\u00a0started the tradition of the Christmas Lights. Lucy said, \"when I first moved into the neighborhood, it looked like a funeral parlor during the winter.\" Lucy's neighbors didn't initially welcome\u00a0her \"over-the-top\" holiday lights display. In fact, Lucy said that when one of\u00a0the neighbors complained about the lights and traffic the lights attracted she told them either to join her with holiday decorations or to move out of the neighborhood. However, when another neighbor started to put up the flamboyant holiday lights to match Lucy's lights, this neighborhood tradition\u00a0really took off!<\/p> <p>We'll be <b>finishing\u00a0between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and 7:00 PM<\/b> near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk. This is for the organizer's Meetup preparation costs and fees.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Time:<\/b>\u00a0The meeting\u00a0time is <i>(before dinner)<\/i> at <b>3:45 PM<\/b>. <b>Allow extra travelling time because the \"R\" subway train is a local train and makes a lot of stops.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Place<\/b>: The meeting place is outside of the entrance to Century 21 Department Store, which is located at 472 Eighty-Sixth (86th) Street, Brooklyn, NY.\u00a0The Century 21 Department Store actually has three entrances (next to\u00a0one another) on 86th Street. We'll meet in front of the first entrance, which is the entrance for Women's Outerwear and Handbags Departments.<\/p> <p>Before the walk, restrooms are located downstairs in Century 21 Department Store. The restrooms are located downstairs near the Men's Suits Department. After we start the walk, we'll have very limited opportunities for a restroom stop because we'll be walking in mostly\u00a0residential neighborhoods.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation:<\/b>\u00a0Take the southbound \"R\" subway train to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.\u00a0After getting off the train, go to the token booth level and make a left turn upstairs. At street level,\u00a0walk east (on the southern side of 86th Street) for about half of a block to the entrances of Century 21 Department Store.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions: <\/b>This is a one-way walk, so we will not be going back to the starting point. If you want to take your car, you can park your car somewhere near the \"R\" subway train at 86th Street and 4th Avenue. At the end of the walk, you will have to take the northbound \"D\" subway train at 71st Street to\u00a036th Street and\u00a0then take the connecting southbound\u00a0\"R\" subway train back down to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Time:<\/b>\u00a0This one-way walk will <b>finish between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and\u00a07:00 PM<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Place:<\/b>\u00a0We'll be finishing near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue. (The \"D\" subway train is the only subway line that runs in Dyker Heights, and it cuts through only one corner of Dyker Heights at 71st Street.)

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

Please take a few moments and read the notes below on our best practices for piloting, frequency and safety management. PLEASE CHECK IN WITH THE FLIGHT\/SAFETY COORDINATOR before you fly or power up anything. First timers will be paired with an established S3 Team Pilot as your \u201cEvent Buddy\u201d. You can observe firsthand S3 team pilots doing the following: flight preparation, pit adjustments, frequency compliance, field behavior and group signaling\/announcing.<br\/>Got a non-racing, photography multirotor? It's always an awesome sight to see a large frame in the air capturing hi-res photography, so if you have one, please bring it. Please check in with Frank to make sure all video transmission is disabled. You will have to fly this line-of-site or run a 200mW VTX and adhere to frequency management to not interfere with the FPV racers.<br\/>Not flying? There's lot's of technical expertise, lurkers, newbies, and interested friends just hanging out, so even if you don't race, you can still fly, take videos, or just watch and learn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPlease check in at the line of canopies at the end of the parking area and ask for Frank.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0\n<b>Suggested equipment to bring:<\/b><br\/>Your aircraft(s), props and batteries, repair equipment<br\/>Something to sit on \u2013 this is an open field.<br\/>Something to sit under like a small (or large) canopy. Team members do bring canopies to manage their equipment and make repairs. We ask that everyone respects the space they need to operate comfortable.<br\/>AMA License: If you plan on flying, you can get it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>).<br\/>Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses (for young pilots under 13 it is HIGHLY recommended)<br\/>Sunscreen and water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING<\/b>:<br\/><b>NO FLY ZONE<\/b>: For safety, the no fly zone is \"IN, ABOVE AND BEHIND\" the line formed by the pilot pit area. You may not operate your quad behind or to the right of the last canopy. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there are lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control or not.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FLY ZONE<\/b>: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone . Please pilot your aircraft from within the pit area (aka the no-fly-zone). If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intentions so other pilots can avoid you. During free flight\/ practice. you may enter the field by announcing \u201cON THE FIELD\u201d loudly to entire pit area.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>CRASH &amp; TRASH<\/b>: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless and keep the park rangers happy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>KIDS<\/b>: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>\"ZERO HARM\" RESPONSIBLE FLYING:<\/b> Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious oriented and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. IOW, if you are about to have a collision, especially with a dog, bird, human, or any living thing, think \"zero harm\" first and do everything you can to avoid the collision and immediately divert your flight path even if it means at the expense of your own rig. Living things are a lot harder to repair than metal and electronics and typically don't require litigation to fix. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>RACING<\/b>: Know your skill limits and pilot your quad accordingly. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx channel \"X\" , or the most critical, \"WHOMEVER JUST POWERED UP, PLEASE POWER DOWN IMMEDIATELY!\" and so on. It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. But beyond this, most importantly, have a blast of fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT <\/b><br\/>Since most pilots are using the 5.8ghz video transmitter bands for FPV video, so please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark\/Immersion or Boscam) and frequency channel. Every pilot uses this technology to fly their aircraft safely, so it is imperative that every pilot understands and operates using safe video transmission practices.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>THE BASICS: <\/b><br\/>1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. LOOK THROUGH YOU GOGGLES FIRST. Someone may accidentally be on the channel you were assigned. Listen intently when you do (even if you have a frequency tag), and if you hear a pilot exclaim that they've lost signal, power down immediately. Flying blind is a dangerous situation and is to be avoided at all costs.<br\/>2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles\/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping.<br\/>3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video .<br\/>4) For racing, the racing coordinator(s) will make frequency assignments and assign spotters.<br\/>5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Looking forward to seeing you there!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Go to the back parking lot and we're between the two baseball fields","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Team-S3-FPV-Multirotor-Racing\/events\/227773229\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"FPV Racing - South Orange, NJ","id":"227773229","time":1451754000000,"updated":1451770303000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441089231000,"name":"Safety Third Racing Team - Multirotor FPV Racing","group_lon":-74.2699966431,"id":18888053,"urlname":"Team-S3-FPV-Multirotor-Racing","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Pilots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07033","country":"us","city":"Kenilworth","address_1":"14 Michigan Avenue","name":"Wildpig Comics","lon":-74.286171,"id":16236662,"state":"NJ","lat":40.676754,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3489341736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448057340000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join DM Noah Anderson as he runs the first D&amp;D 5E Module over two parts!<\/p> <p>The Sword Coast is siege.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Not surprisingly Leadership is also an essential part of the Masonic studies. In the Profane world leadership skills are used to run businesses and governments; in Freemasonry its most important use is to teach each individual how to be their own Masters and conduct a life that is both balanced and upright. Let us explore the many different methods with which an individual can acquire leadership skills and how to efficiently use these skills to not only improve their personal lives but also to contribute to the betterment of humanity.<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/ssl.gstatic.com\/ui\/v1\/icons\/mail\/images\/cleardot.gif\" \/> <b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education.

I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.<\/p> <p>Our greatest primary task is to put people to work electing Bernie Sanders. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Chapter itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our resources toward greater and greater outreach efforts.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of conservatives in our Democratic County Committee and, by engaging on an Islandwide scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a progressive use of the Committee for those best fitted for the Committee. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the numbers of Progressives on the County Committee and with this the power to purchase the output of our Party.<\/p> <p><br\/>It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the enduring lack of an SIPDA logo. It can be helped by insistence that our members act forthwith on the demand that a logo be decided upon.<\/p> <p><br\/>It can be helped by the unifying of creative activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by chapter planning for and supervision of a newsletter which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/THESIPDA\/events\/227564872\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"New Year Inauguration of the SIPDA","id":"227564872","time":1451763000000,"updated":1451774535000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435644811000,"name":"Staten Island Progressive Democrats of America","group_lon":-74.0899963379,"id":18708778,"urlname":"THESIPDA","group_lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Progressive Democrats of America"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11211","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"2 Havemeyer St","name":"Muchmore's","lon":-73.952896,"id":10496742,"state":"Ne","lat":40.716473,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":3.0294380188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1387062471000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for an afternoon of figure drawing!

Inside, half of the house is decorated for Christmas; the other half is decorated for Hanukkah.<\/p> <p>We'll\u00a0also see an 800-pound robotic Santa Claus (he sometimes will have a conversation with you!), merry-go-rounds, Nativity scenes, stately trees bejeweled in colorful lights, inflatable figures, enormous wooden soldiers, dancing animals, candy canes, twinkling snowflakes, and much more.<\/p> <p>One interesting house has holiday greetings illuminated in three languages: English, Italian, and Greek.\u00a0On the side of the house,\u00a0a large snowflake design\u00a0periodically lights up as\u00a0a\u00a0Star of David. This house is incredible!<\/p> <p><b>How the Dyker Heights' holiday light tradition\u00a0got started:<\/b><\/p> <p>In the mid-1980s,\u00a0Lucy Spata\u00a0started the tradition of the Christmas Lights. Lucy said, \"when I first moved into the neighborhood, it looked like a funeral parlor during the winter.\" Lucy's neighbors didn't initially welcome\u00a0her \"over-the-top\" holiday lights display. In fact, Lucy said that when one of\u00a0the neighbors complained about the lights and traffic the lights attracted she told them either to join her with holiday decorations or to move out of the neighborhood. However, when another neighbor started to put up the flamboyant holiday lights to match Lucy's lights, this neighborhood tradition\u00a0really took off!<\/p> <p>We'll be <b>finishing\u00a0between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and 7:00 PM<\/b> near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk.

After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/227661798\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"pckzryvcbdb","time":1451773800000,"updated":1451837027000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"110 Waverly Place","address_2":"Washington Square Park","lon":-73.999279,"phone":"212.777.0303 ","name":"Babbo","id":1325208,"state":"NY","lat":40.732286,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":4,"headcount":0,"distance":1.31954455376,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1451149541000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Back by popular demand!

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

Skills of communication, boundaries, asking for what you want, and saying \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 with clarity and kindness.<\/p> <p>Cuddle Party is led by trained and certified Cuddle Party Facilitators. The Facilitator\u2019s job is to guide you into those skills gently and easily, in a fun, safe and light hearted way. We welcome you and create an atmosphere of respect, and remain available for questions and support.<\/p> <p>At a Cuddle Party you gain:<br\/>* Clarity and confidence<br\/>* Boundary and communication skills<br\/>* Comfort, support and encouragement<br\/>* The secrets to welcome, relaxed, non-sexual touch<\/p> <p>The skills you learn at Cuddle Party translate into every day life, right from the start. When boundaries and consent are clear, every relationship is easier.<\/p> <p>Where else can you attend a workshop in your pajamas?<\/p> <p><b> Cuddle Party is \u2026 a social event!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We open with a Welcome Circle - about 45 minutes of introductions, rules and a few games to help everyone get comfortable. We teach communication and boundary skills in ways that are lighthearted and fun.<\/p> <p>Then we open up for \u2018free-style\u2019 cuddling. You have plenty of time to relax, chat, share a back rub or other welcome touch, cuddle, have a snack or just hang out.<\/p> <p>You can come to a Cuddle Party to meet new people, to enjoy amazing conversations, to touch, to be touched, to have fun, to practice asking for what you want, to practice saying \u201cno\u201d to what you don\u2019t want \u2014 all in a setting structured to be a safe place for exploration and enjoyment. Shucks, you can even come to a Cuddle Party just to cuddle!<\/p> <p><b>These are the Cuddle Party rules.<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Pajamas (or cuddle-clothes) stay on the whole time.<\/p> <p>2) You don't have to cuddle anyone at a Cuddle Party, ever.<\/p> <p>3) You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone. (Be as specific in your request as you can.)<\/p> <p>4) If you're a yes, say YES. If you're a no, say NO.<\/p> <p>5) If you're a maybe, say NO.<\/p> <p>6) You are encouraged to change your mind anytime you want.<\/p> <p>7) Respect your relationship agreements and communicate with your partner.<\/p> <p>8) Get me of my assistant if you have a questions or concern or need assistance with anything during the Cuddle Party.<\/p> <p>9) Tears and laughter are both welcome.<\/p> <p>10) Respect people's privacy when sharing about Cuddle Parties and do not gossip.<\/p> <p>11) Arrive on time.<\/p> <p>12) Be hygienically savvy.<\/p> <p><b>Want to know more about Cuddle Party?<\/b><\/p> <p>Cuddle Party has been around since February 2004.<\/p> <p><br\/>There is lots of information about Cuddle Parties on the official Cuddle Party website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuddleparty.com\">www.cuddleparty.com<\/a> so if you are curious, be sure to check out the FAQ section and some of the articles too<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/b\/4\/600_443414772.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Be On Time: <\/b>PLEASE arrive on time at 6:00 PM to check-in and change into your Cuddle Clothes so we can start the Welcome Circle by 6:30 PM.<\/p> <p><b>No Late Arrivals:<\/b> Sorry - but after the Welcome Circle begins, no late arrivals can enter<\/p> <p><b>What To Wear: <\/b>Pajamas\/Athletic Wear. \u00a0Think more comfy than sexy.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What To Bring:<\/b> A pillow or stuffed animal if you like.

How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\"&gt;main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atwysspeeddating\/events\/227320782\/","yes_rsvp_count":28,"name":"Speeddating Ages 34-47 --1F\/2M SPOTS LEFT","id":"227320782","time":1451775600000,"updated":1451787301000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1236056430000,"name":"...And That's Why You're Single Speed Dating Parties","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1397777,"urlname":"atwysspeeddating","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Manhattan Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"Disclosed on Tickets","name":"Brooklyn","lon":-73.94416,"id":24271904,"state":"NY","lat":40.678177,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.52385520935,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451503118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Happy Hour tour will bring you to the center of New York\u2019s booming cocktail culture as we visit some of the best cocktail bars in the city.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options.
