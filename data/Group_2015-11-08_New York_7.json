This is a group for anyone interested in practicing or learning about mindfulness and meditation. There are so many wonderful opportunities to practice with communities in other boroughs of NYC--but not so many in Queens. Let's create mindful community right here in our own neighborhood so we can support one another and practice together. This Meetup group will be used to post local mindfulness events, meditation classes, talks, and more. No experience with meditation or mindfulness necessary. All experience levels welcome. If you know of a mindfulness event happening in Astoria (or in other Queens neighborhoods,) please let the organizer know. Please note: you do NOT have to live in Astoria (or even in Queens) to attend one of our meetups.<\/p>\n<p>Like our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mindfulastoria?pnref=story\">Facebook page<\/a> for updates, news, articles, and more.<\/p>","lon":-73.9199981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/0\/c\/highres_306238892.jpeg","photo_id":306238892,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/0\/c\/600_306238892.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/0\/c\/thumb_306238892.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":46820332,"name":"Emily H"},"members":603,"name":"Mindfulness Meditation, Astoria\/Queens NY","id":11058102,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mindfulness-Meditation-Astoria-Queens-NY","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Wakeful minds"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1384206469000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"art","name":"Live Music","id":1502},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"free-events","name":"Free Events","id":17087},{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freeNY\/","rating":4.18,"description":"<p>Dear New Yorkers, <br> New York has become one of the most expensive city in the world and I thought it would be great to post as many free events as we can. <br> Of course, I am not that genius who knows everything about anything, so once the group reaches a decent amount of members, I hope I will find a good dozen of organizers willing to help. <br> How ?

This is a path open to all seekers of the unseen, those striving to connect to their spiritual inner life, to give new meaning and direction that is easily put into practice.<\/p>\n<p>You can hear many of Musa's discourses on his website at <a>www.thewitnesswithin.com.<\/a> His latest book, The Elixir of Truth: Journey on the Sufi Path, is available through Amazon.com.<\/p>\n<p>To quote Musa, \u201cThere is this mystery of man\u2019s relationship to God. Every person has this relationship. We need to explore this relationship, and make that exploration something that is a life-long priority. We identify with our bodies, but we are not our body. Similarly, we identify with our culture, language, religions, but we are not any of these things either. Our true story is the story of our real identity. We need to find what and who that is. Just as we have duties to our family, and within the work-sphere, at the same time we also have to do what is necessary to understand where reality is, and who we are in that reality.

It maintains that humans have evolved on Earth, that there is no supernatural world to aspire to, and that we give meaning to our own lives. Humanists maintain that we have each other to take responsibility for the resolution of human-made problems, that with compassion, rational thought, justice, and courage we can create a world that benefits all humanity. We are passionately working toward a culture of peace, equality, health, and respect for Earth our home.<\/p>\n<p>The Humanist philosophy respects and embraces the efforts of all caring persons, all faiths, all ethnicities, all traditions, and all nations to improve the perilous conditions of humankind. We value life, family, and the larger family of humanity. We believe in the ethical and peaceful pursuit of individual and community happiness and well being. We come together as a group to share ideas, learn new ways of thinking, and encourage others to do likewise.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1974, the Humanist Society of Metropolitan New York (HSMNY), the Corliss Lamont Chapter of the American Humanist Association (AHA),\u00a0 seeks to promote Humanism and free thought in our community. We affirm our ability to lead meaningful, ethical lives capable of contributing to the greater good of all people. We favor opinions formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, revelation, or dogma. Our goals are to:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Provide a forum for mutual and public learning and improvement<br>\n\n \u2022 Form a warm, supportive community of like-minded people<br>\n\n \u2022 Counter the forces in our society that divide us and imperil our world<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all who wish to participate.

Not part-time, not as a hobby, not as a source of quick \"money on the side\" with several months in between doing something else. It's our full-time job, or truly augments it (for example, some talented individuals do equal amounts of stage\/film\/TV as well as VO work ).

We have a large email list, completely separate from this website, and get about 5 to 10 people per meeting just from that.<span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Anyway, most importantly, this group is commitment-free. Some of our members attend nearly every meeting; others show up once a month or even once a year. The main rule is to bring something to work on for the first hour. No assignments. No prompts. It's just a solid chunk of quiet time that you can use however you want. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> After the writing, there's a short break, and then we gather a little closer to take turns introducing ourselves. After that, we spend another hour or so doing an informal reading of our work. No one is ever forced to read -- that's not our style -- so at any given meeting, about half the people might end up sharing something. Some people read stuff they've been working on for a while. Others read what they've written during the hour. There's n<\/span><\/span>o need to bring copies because we read aloud. Each person gets eight minutes, which includes time for others to offer feedback, so we keep things moving at a pretty good pace.&nbsp;<span><br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> People in this group have written and shared all kinds of stuff:&nbsp;novels,&nbsp;short stories,&nbsp;journal and diary entries,&nbsp;poems,&nbsp;personal essays,&nbsp;memoirs, plays, screenplays,&nbsp;articles, dialogues, outlines, limericks, newsletters, blogs, kids books, science fiction, erotica, comedy, book proposals, cartoon strips, horoscopes, wedding speeches, eulogies, and song lyrics. Anything goes, and the same is true for your writing experience. You don't have to be published or submit samples in order to join. The purpose is to have a varied crowd and a relaxed setting where we actually do some writing and have a chance to hang out and meet fellow writers, and since people often ask, we're mostly in our 20s and 30s. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> We get together every week or two. There's no regular location because we usually meet in people's homes all over the place. (If you can host, please speak up!) Twice a year, we meet at a big, antiquarian bookstore in midtown. In warmer months, we meet semi-regularly in Central Park and other outdoor spots. We've even taken a few road trips as a group,&nbsp;<\/span>but we almost always stay within MetroCard range. Once per month (ish),&nbsp;we meet on weekend afternoons, but we usually do our thing on weeknights from 7:00 until about 10:30pm. People are welcome to show up late or leave early, so don't worry if these times aren't ideal. Can't make it for the writing hour? No problem.

you like to accurately learn and play the music of the Grateful Dead?\u00a0 At each session, participants will learn two or three songs with song specific soloing strategies and extensive jamming.\u00a0 Each session is two and a half hours.\u00a0 Each session is limited to six participants.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of these workshops is for individuals to express their developing concepts and performance skills in an organized context through the use of charts that demonstrate specific song forms, soloing strategies that are song specific, and learning techniques that utilize modern technology.\u00a0 Additionally, the workshop will foster stronger group cohesion, rhythmic synchronization, and group groove.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating a Grateful Dead Song and Jam group since 2010. \u00a0The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the Grateful Dead. \u00a0These sessions are a lot of fun. \u00a0Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the Grateful Dead with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.\u00a0 Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.\u00a0 Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.\u00a0 Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.\u00a0 Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. \u00a0Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.\u00a0 Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.\u00a0<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The music of the Grateful Dead is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. \u00a0However, learning the music of the Grateful Dead can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. \u00a0 \u00a0This is how I can help you learn. \u00a0This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the Grateful Dead played it. \u00a0The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.\u00a0 I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.\u00a0 The charts are clear about song form,\u00a0intros, \u00a0chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.\u00a0 Both Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir\u2019s parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In some cases, actual Phil Lesh bass lines have been transcribed. \u00a0The Grateful Dead, like many bands, shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord\u00a0progressions and song\u00a0forms; the actual chord voicings Jerry used;\u00a0the actual chord voicings Bob used;\u00a0specific chord progressions used during the improv sections;\u00a0pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;\u00a0chord\/scale combinations; Jerry's use of chromaticism; complicated ostinatos; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.\u00a0 This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.\u00a0 However, there is no obligation to improvise.\u00a0 There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.\u00a0 People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. \u00a0In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on over 50 songs including: \u00a0<\/span><span>Alabama Getaway, Bertha, Big River, Birdsong, Black Muddy River, Brown Eyed Women, Casey Jones, China Cat Sunflower, Deal, El Paso, Eyes Of The World, Fire On The Mountain, Franklin's Tower, Friend Of The Devil, Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad, Good Lovin\u2019, I Know You Rider, Jack-A-Roe, Jackstraw, Johnny B.

<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 To inform, educate, inspire, and motivate entrepreneurs worldwide to start <a>small businesses<\/a> through Crowdfunding and provide them a blueprint on how to Crowdfund. <br> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net\/items\/it\/img\/arrow-10x10.png\"><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>We will provide our members with PRACTICAL, not THEORETICAL advice on how to Crowdfund as we ourselves have prepared for three months to launch our own Crowdfunding campaign. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>We by no means consider ourselves experts but we do have lessons learned that we would love to share with our members in a non-judgement free environment. &nbsp;Too many people are making themselves out to be experts without ever having the experience of Crowdfunding under their belt. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Our meetup group seeks to provide you with actionable knowledge and information from day 1. &nbsp;We check the theory at the door and focus on what will make you successful in your own endeavors. &nbsp;We hope we are making this abundantly clear, we want people to join us who GET THINGS DONE!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><b>Our Channels of

There's something for everyone at NHOC. Aside from hiking, the club is involved with many activities including camping, walking, horseback riding, bicycling, picnicking, and just about anything which broadens knowledge of and respect for nature. Some members participate in trail maintenance and other conservation efforts. During the winter months, indoor as well as outdoor activities are offered. All hikes and activities are graded on their level of difficulty - from easy (\"C\") to challenging (\"A\"). We are a friendly, social group looking for new members. \u00a0Many of our members fall into the SINGLES category and there is no better way to find new friends than by participating in an activity that you love. If you decide to become a full paying member of NHOC, you will receive our Shorelines publication several times throughout the year, informing you of all of our activities.

Members who don't attend a meetup within 6 months, regularly no show or RSVP will be removed. That is just to keep a small active group of women who know one another and have great conversation.

PONY allows its students to benefit from the same excellent, conservatory-trained musicians who teach the paying students of the Piano School of New York.\n\nPONY's scholarships cover 50-80% of the cost of the lessons, with parents, schools or PTAs making up the difference. Class size is small: three to six students. Piano-playing skills, note reading and writing, ear training, and rhythm are taught, together with music history. Each class is designed to meet the children.s individual needs according to their ages, and all children are introduced to a wide range of music, from sacred choral works of the Renaissance to 20th century jazz. PONY classes are educational, inspiring, and just plain fun! Each student receives individual piano instruction at every session, performs for and with classmates, and plays duets with their teachers. Year-end recitals at Alfred Lerner Hall at Columbia University provide a tremendous incentive and are highly rewarding to all participating students.\n\nPONY was incorporated in 2003 and has been approved by the IRS as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. It is an outgrowth of the Piano School of New York, which since its founding in 2001 has experienced extraordinary growth. Today more than 1500 children in over 60 public, parochial, and nursery schools throughout the City are enrolled in our group classes. At a time when spending on the arts in schools has been drastically cut back, the Piano School and the Piano Outreach actually bring the only music into many schools in New York City. In fact, The Piano School of New York has been placing pianos and\/or keyboards in schools where no instrument is available.\n","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/highres_338099792.jpeg","photo_id":338099792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/600_338099792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/9\/0\/thumb_338099792.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120364042,"name":"Nat Berman"},"members":12,"name":"Piano Outreach of New York","id":13118922,"state":"NY","urlname":"Piano-Outreach-of-New-York","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1393688588000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Fit-Club\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>Hi Everyone!&nbsp; Welcome.<\/p>\n<p>My vision for this group =&nbsp;\"grown-up gym class\" for anyone 26 and older. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp; To get together at least once\/week for a pick-up game involving a different activity each time, with the emphasis on making fitness fun - basically, to get outside and play!

So for example, we may say, \"This week we'll build the map screen for a simple mapping application that supports push-pins, on iOS\". \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We'll then break the group into teams of 2, attempting to balance out our experience and talent levels as well as possible. \u00a0 After that point, we'll all go away and dive into the code. \u00a0Each group of two will work on the project for the duration of the sprint. We'll create an environment of open collaboration by way of an online project management tool. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>The following meetup will then serve as a code review where we will conduct the following exercises as a group:\u00a0<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>1) Compare architectural decisions and defend reasons for making those decisions<\/p>\n<p>2) Discuss extensions and other third-party components used to aid development<\/p>\n<p>3) Discuss your greatest pain points, or where you flat out hit a brick wall<\/p>\n<p>4) Attempt to gain consensus on the best methods of accomplishing each of the tasks, and compile those methods into a best-practices reference<\/p>\n<p>5) Merge our best code into a common area, and promote that version as group-certified (it's probably very ambitious to try to accomplish this during an actual Meetup)<\/p>\n<p>Then we'll define the next project, and re-start the development cycle. \u00a0We can either completely start over with an altogether different project, or build new components onto the existing one, gradually working our way towards an enterprise-worthy app. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>One great thing about these short development sprints is that we can always bring on new developers at any one of our Meetups.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74.4100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/highres_368948232.jpeg","photo_id":368948232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/600_368948232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/thumb_368948232.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":135765842,"name":"Todd Nakamura"},"members":63,"name":"NJ Mobile .NET Developers","id":13160752,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJ-Mobile-Dotnet-Developers","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Xamarians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1393975166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"ruby-on-rails","name":"Ruby On Rails","id":20837},{"urlkey":"objective-c","name":"Objective C","id":21477},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"girlsintech","name":"Girls in Tech","id":65944},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"women-software-developers","name":"Women Software Developers","id":149654},{"urlkey":"ui-ux-design","name":"UI\/UX design","id":917292},{"urlkey":"women-who-code","name":"Women Who Code","id":1398192},{"urlkey":"wwc","name":"wwc","id":1489532}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Women-Who-Code-Connecticut\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p>Mission:<\/p>\n<p>Women Who Code is a global nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers by creating a global, connected community of women in technology.

Through the group process, you will learn to give yourself permission to express yourself fully in all aspects of your Self, to recognize the good and the healthy, while unraveling the strategies and contexts that keep you stuck. We will partner to uncover that which has been shunned or pushed to the dark and forgotten--those destructive behaviors and unfulfilling relationships that limit your emotional growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My way of being and working with you is warm, respectful, authentic, honest and compassionate. As a group facilitator, my role is to facilitate and move the conversation forward, while attending to the group process and your present moment awareness. The power of group lies in the unique opportunity to receive multiple perspectives, support, encouragement and feedback from other individuals in safe and confidential environment. These interpersonal interactions can provide group members an opportunity to deepen their level of self-awareness and to learn how they relate to others. The Relationship Circle can be a safe and supportive place to experiment with new ideas and ways of being.

My goal is to support and help as many women as I possible &nbsp;can If I only reach one woman to understand the dangers of an abusive relationship and from the devastating &nbsp;effects abuse of any form can have on a woman ( I myself know this only too well) then I have accomplished something worth doing. Abuse ladies comes in many forms abusive men are also known as sociopath- narcissistic- antisocial sociopath) antisocial sociopath is what my ex- husband was actually diagnosed with when he was sent to prison. I would like everyone to bear in mind that regardless of what problems these men may have there is no excuse in anyway shape or form for their behavior or to abuse or mistreat another person in fact statistics have shown these men know exactly what they are doing and to who they are doing it to also that they are not capable of empathy or remorse statistics have proven that a very small- very small I empathize here percentage of abusive men change please keep that in mind.I have been through extensive therapy and still attend therapy once a week I have researched and read numerous books on abuse all kinds of abuse I have attended Many domestic violence meetings and groups I was asked to speak at a domestic violence benefit back in 2012- I will post my speech on the site- I do this because one it helps me to understand things on a different level regarding domestic violence , myself and the behavior of the abuser . SECOND it gives me the information and knowledge I need to help myself and other woman &nbsp;before it could possibly be to late. I had another group located in Brooklyn before starting this one that actually went extremely well but I had gotten sick for a little while and &nbsp;had to closed that group because I wasn't well enough to keep up with it. I have a GREAT amount of compassion-understanding and an anonymous passion to reach as many women as I can to help them realize abusive relationships are not normal or healthy in fact they are extremely dangerous not only just on a physical level but financially -Verbally and can be extremely emotionally devastating to the point where our self-worth and self-esteem are almost nonexistent everything I write here is because I have been through it and without support and the right people in your life it can be extremely hard to overcome it's sad to say but the truth is some people may never overcome what &nbsp;they have been through but with support and the right people and knowledge we can heal. it has &nbsp;been my experience that only people who have been through the same situation can really feel and understand our pain I remember I had two women in my last group one woman said to me he doesn't really abuse me he just hits me once in a while and calls me names another woman said and this is the woman I asked to leave my group said that it was okay for men to behave verbally or abusive because that's how she grew up and what her parents did and that it was excepted back then I do not agree with this at all please don't get me wrong I was not being mean or un sympathetic the woman I'm talking about is actually a friend of mine I tried to make her realize that this is not acceptable and that no one has the right to mistreat anyone then or now so I simply said if this is your beliefs &nbsp;on this matter that it would be better if she didn't attend the group just for the fact that I did not want any woman or anyone to think that abuse is acceptable or okay She actually understood we are still friends but unfortunately she thinks it's okay for men as she puts it to get a little crazy and I believe for this reason she is not able to have a healthy stable relationships for long periods at a time I will always be there for her and love her very much I have faith that one day she will get it right I also might add that at times I let her know that she is welcome to attend the group to listen and learn. My story goes something like this and I'm sure a lot of women can relate I met my ex-husband Jeffrey in early 2009 Jeffrey was loving understanding very giving very caring told me all the things I wanted to hear At the time when I met Jeffrey I had just recently come out of a relationship it wasn't an abusive relationship just that the gentleman I was with who was actually a very &nbsp;good man had gotten caught up with drugs wouldn't get help and I didn't want to be in that type of relationship that type of relationship isnt &nbsp;abusive but it is however dysfunctional in my opinion okay back to Jeffrey it was only a few months before Jeffrey's true colors came through it &nbsp;kind of started very saddle almost as if you wouldn't notice &nbsp;it But I saw it from the start. at that time because of my own insecurities and self-esteem I chose to ignore it and pretend nothing was wrong &nbsp;so what started &nbsp;with verbal abuse neglect disrespect eventually ended in physical abuse I was verbally abused almost on a daily basis with some of the most cruel hurtful words I have ever heard if Jeffrey didn't get what he wanted or if you didn't act the way he thought you should be he became very angry and aggressive I should mention I hid Jeffrey and our relationship from my family for most of the time we were together why you might say? for one because I knew he was an abusive man But at that time I believed I loved him and didn't want anyone to say why don't you leave him get away from him I had so many insecurities and my self-esteem you couldn't pick up with &nbsp;a shovel that in my head I thought it was better to be with him because my mind was telling me who would want you Antoinette as time went on the abuse got worse and worse verbal abuse constantly physical abuse to the point of a blackeye a dislocated shoulder many &nbsp;bruises &nbsp;lifting the mattress in the air while I was sleeping and throwing me off &nbsp;the bed hitting the dresser against the wall which has now cost me several herniated disc standing and arguing with him one day he grabbed my feet well my ankles which caused me to land on my back and hit my head and causing more injuries now to my neck I remember for some reason a particular time that stands out in my head Jeffrey and I had just gotten married it was only two weeks after our marriage we had a huge fight and I threw him out and he went to stay in a hotel I found out months later he actually had an affair with a prostitute in that hotel I didn't know that at the time I took him back I let him came back home and &nbsp;and he wanted to have sex So we had sex in the Middle of sex he decided to grab me and push me half out the window naked calling me a whore telling me I like it let everyone see the whore u are this was Jeffrey's way of humiliating me and getting back at me for throwing him out Jeffrey as most abusive man are extremely manipulating not to mention they can be very charming and that is how they are able to &nbsp;get you to want them even more manipulating abusive men tend to look for vulnerable weak insecure unstable &nbsp;women they are on the prowl for easy prey I'm sure some of you must be saying why would I put up with something like this but ladies and I'm sure a lot of you know there are many many reasons why women put up with abuse And one of the reasons for this &nbsp;group is to bring out the points of why we put up with abuse recognize them understand the reasoning and put ourselves on a journey to healing there is more to my story and yes with a happy ending that I will talk about in our group meetings also this doesn't have to only be in groups one on one meetings are also available for women who are not comfortable yet talking in groups. For me the first step in &nbsp;recognizing abuse was to admit there was abuse and to believe that I am worth more then to be mistreated &nbsp;and to reach out for &nbsp;help and support&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>
