Building Brotherhood is a men only Light Of Iris healing event.<\/p> <p>What is Light Of Iris?<\/p> <p><br\/>Love Includes Growing Heights Together of Integration Responsibility Intuition and Simplicity. Light of Iris is a Shamanic healing ceremony that uses meditation, journaling, dance, drawing, music, and .... more to help facilitate lasting emotional healing and a permanent expansion of consciousness. For some that means increased creativity, for others that can mean healing deeply repressed childhood wounds in a matter of hours, for some it can mean reawakening a connection to ones ancestors and their power. It is named after my late Great Grandmother Iris Palmer who came to me in a vision as pure light during a previous ceremony. I don't have the right words to describe the impact that had on me, but we do want to share that possibility with others. This is about remembering who you are and standing in that power.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/230350757\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:30 am!","id":"hssxjlyvgbgc","time":1461504600000,"updated":1461517102000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439688959000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Start your Sunday off right!

Van Dyck\u2019s supremely elegant manner and convincing evocation of a sitter\u2019s inner life \u2014 whether real or imagined \u2014 made him the favorite portraitist of many of the most powerful and interesting figures of the seventeenth century. This is the most comprehensive exhibition ever organized on Van Dyck\u2019s activity and process as a portraitist and the first major exhibition on the artist to be held in the United States in over twenty years. Through approximately one hundred works, the exhibition explores the astounding versatility and inventiveness of a portrait specialist, the stylistic development of a draftsman and painter, and the efficiency and genius of an artist in action. Lenders include the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the British Museum and National Gallery in London, the Prado Museum in Madrid, and major private collectors such as the Duke of Devonshire and the Duke of Buccleuch.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/1\/5\/600_447487445.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a multigroup meetup.

(technically it's on the 18th.)<\/p> <p><b>About Member's Choice Shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>This type of shoot is a way of giving back to the members on special occasions, such as a birthdays. With this shoot, a member will pick out their dream team group of models and we'll put together a shoot around some of the member's concepts.<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned with a fourth look pending time. Weather permitting, we'll get to do some outdoor shooting. Michael's ideas are swimwear, sexy sporty (it is baseball season after all) and lingerie. Plus, we have a few other ideas from Michael's series pending time. For outdoor shooting, feel free to bring your speed lights, reflectors and any modifiers to get shots in your preferred portable lighting setups. Indoors, we'll have our strobe and LED setups.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>We have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. So, please\u00a0only\u00a0sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit to hold your spot.

All deposits need to be received immediately upon signup or within 5 days of the shoot or we will have to fill the unconfirmed spot\/s ASAP if there is a waitlist or cancel the shoot (existing deposits returned) if the minimum RSVP is not met.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/229897322\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Member's Choice: Glamour Galore w\/Stephanie Dec & Stacy Winters - April 24th","id":"229897322","time":1461513600000,"updated":1461525594000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bayside","address_1":"192-23 Station Rd","name":"Fitness R Us","lon":-73.789566,"id":23715963,"state":"NY","lat":40.761127,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.5398569107,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457583963000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Wellness Healing &amp; Psychic Fair - Bayside, Queens<\/p> <p>Come and join us at Fitness \"R\" Us,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Located at 192 -23 Station Rd, Bayside NY 11358\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please join us for our Wellness Fair on Sunday, April 24.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/230466858\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"cvdgrlyvgbgc","time":1461513600000,"updated":1461525686000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"207 5th Ave","name":"Body Reserve Gym","lon":-73.980309,"id":24274751,"state":"NY","lat":40.676109,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.1411113739,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452886207000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Are you looking for a complementary training to <b>ENHANCE<\/b> your overall well being on and off the track, to be more <b>FLEXIBLE <\/b>and <b>RELEASE<\/b> physical, mental and emotional tensions?<\/p> <p><br\/>Are you looking for <b>RELIEF<\/b> from joint wear, tightness, pain, and\/or discomfort?<\/p> <p>$5 FOR FIRST CLASS TO CROSS TRAIN...<\/p> <p>_________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b><i>About <\/i><i>Yin Yang Yoga...<\/i><\/b><b><i>A typical Yoga class is \u2018Yang\u2019 in style and focuses on active heating and muscular contraction - by starting with \u2018Yin\u2019, a more passive, nourishing, and cooling practice, this uniquely designed class WILL enhance your alignment, performance, and overall sense of balance!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why For Runners\/Athletes?<\/b> - Lengthening and releasing effect from repetitive movements on sheets of connective tissue can overtime shorten and tighten it in ingrained patterns around the muscles.

It's certainly less crowded and it has more of a rustic, woodsy feel in many parts. Two new attractions: Smorgasburg, the craft-food fair, is now here on Sundays for the first time. Also here now are paddle boats on the scenic lake, which we can rent for $5 per half hour. (The boats cost $10 per hour for two people, $7.50 for four. We'll switch passengers after half an hour, which seems like plenty of time. During the half hour that you're not paddling, we'll either relax at the lake or maybe take a short walk.

We'll eat at around 2 or 2:30 PM.<\/p> <p>COST: $4-$5 if you rent a paddle boat; pay what you wish at the Lefferts House (suggested fee $3); $2 for me, in part to cover Meetup's organizer fee; and whatever you pay for lunch.\u00a0<\/p> <p>TRANSPORTATION: 2 or 3 train to Grand Army Plaza station.

The grand-opening menu is less extensive than at Golden Palace, and it introduces many dishes from more-assimilated Chinese cuisines. (Greetings, General Tso.) Prices, of course, befit a Manhattan thoroughfare and not a side street off Kissena Blvd. \u2014 but factor in the cost of travel time, and a group dinner seems promising.

From the steps of Vanderbilt Gate on Fifth Avenue and 105th Street, the sweeping view of the Center Garden's formal green lawn is capped at the far end with this elegant geyser fountain. One of three stylized gardens that make up the six-acre Conservatory Garden, the Center Garden features hallmarks of its classic Italian design, geometric shaped vegetation, and fountains.

It is divided into three smaller gardens, each with a distinct style: Italian, French, and English. The Garden's main entrance is through the Vanderbilt Gate, on Fifth Avenue between 104th and 105th Streets. This magnificent iron gate, made in Paris in 1894, originally stood before the Vanderbilt mansion at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street.<\/p> <p>The Italianate center garden is composed of a large lawn surrounded by yew hedges and is bordered by two exquisite all\u00e9es of spring-blooming pink and white crabapple trees. A 12-foot high jet fountain plays on the western end of the lawn, backed by tiered hedges and stairs that lead up to a wisteria pergola. On the walkway under the pergola are medallions inscribed with the names of the original 13 states.<\/p> <p>The northern, French-style garden showcases parterres of germander and spectacular seasonal displays of spring tulips, and Korean chrysanthemums in autumn, all within an ellipse of Japanese holly. In the center is the charming Three Dancing Maidens fountain by German sculptor, Walter Schott. To the south is the very intimate English-style garden. There are five mixed borders of trees, shrubs and perennial plants, and five seasonal beds featuring spring bulbs that are followed by annual flower displays. A slope of woodland plants lines the western edge of this garden. At the center is sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh's lovely Frances Hodgeson Burnett Memorial Fountain, a tribute to the author of the children's book, The Secret Garden. The children \u2014 a girl and a boy, said to depict Mary and Dickon, the main characters from the classic \u2014 stand at one end of a small water lily pool.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Conservatory Garden is an officially designated Quiet Zone and offers a calm and colorful setting for a leisurely stroll, and intimate wedding, or an escape with a good book.<\/p> <p>For many years the garden was tended by volunteers from the Garden Club of America and in 1983 it was restored by the Central Park Conservancy.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>East Side from 104th-106th Streets.

The heart of the North Woods is the Ravine. Fallen trees, or snags, are left where they land (unless hazardous or obscuring paths), providing nutrients to surrounding plants, homes to wildlife and a natural look to the landscape.<\/p> <p>Once entering through the magnificent rustic Glen Span Arch at the eastern edge of the Pool (between 100th and 103rd Streets), Park visitors are treated to a view of the Loch, a stream rebuilt by the Conservancy in the 1990s. The North Woods is a favorite spot of birdwatchers and hikers. Free guided tours are available regularly. You can learn more about the North Woods, and the Park's other woodlands (the Ramble and the Hallett Nature Sanctuary), through one of our Woodland Discovery Programs.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>East Side to Mid-Park from 101nd - 110nd Streets.<\/p> <p><br\/>Blockhouse<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/blockhouse-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Central Park's oldest building, the Blockhouse is also the only remaining fortification of the many built in 1814 to defend against the British. It stands on the edge of a high precipice above the lower topography of Harlem. The rugged stone structure once had a sunken wooden roof and mobile cannon that could be deployed quickly. Today, the Blockhouse is empty, roofless, and securely locked.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side at 109th Street and Central Park West.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare Garden<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/shakespeare-garden-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shakespeare Garden is a four-acre landscape is named for the famed English poet and playwright. The garden is features flowers and plants mentioned in his poems and plays, with small bronze plaques scattered throughout the garden with quotes from the Bard.<\/p> <p>The garden was first conceived in the 1880s when park commissioner George Clausen asked the Park's entomologist to create a garden adjacent to the nature study center in the Swedish Cottage. In 1913, Commissioner Gaynor dedicated it officially to the works of Shakespeare. After years of neglect, Shakespeare Garden, just as most of Central Park, fell into disrepair. In 1987, Central Park Conservancy restored and expanded the garden, repaving pathways and installing rustic wooden benches and bronze plaques with quotations from the Bard's masterpiece.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side between 79th and 80th Streets.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Ramble<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/assets\/images\/2014\/things-to-see-and-do\/Ramble-750.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To use the words of Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, The Ramble is a 38-acre \"wild garden.\" \u00a0Central Park's designers imagined a tranquil spot where visitors could stroll, discover forest gardens rich with plantings, and meander along the paths. This truly is a place for the urban explorer to escape the city and get utterly lost in nature.<\/p> <p>This was one of the first parts of the Park to be built, and except for the bedrock platform, it is totally artificial. Even the water running in the stream and the adjacent Lake is turned on and off like a faucet. Some of the trees you see date back to 1859 when the Ramble was planted.<\/p> <p>Beneath the leafy canopy, you are surrounded by a thriving wildlife habitat. Because of its location on the Atlantic Flyway \u2014\u00a0the migration route birds follow in the spring and fall \u2014 the Ramble is the center of birding activity in the Park. Over 230 species have been spotted, and over 40 other species remain in the Park all year long.<\/p> <p>Every year, more than 25 million people visit Central Park, which is more than any other urban Park in the world. By working with environmental groups, the Central Park Conservancy has developed a woodland restoration and management plan, which involves your participation as well.<\/p> <p>First, \"carry in, carry out.\" \u00a0All of the trash and recycling bins have been removed from inside the Ramble, and placed at the entrances. If you enjoy a picnic in this beautiful setting, don't forget to take your leftovers with you and dispose of them properly. It's a simple gesture, but it really helps the environment and the Conservancy staff responsible for its care.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park from 73rd to 79th Streets.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506619071\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nBelvedere Castle<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/belvedere-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Calvert Vaux, co-designer of Central Park, created the miniature castle in 1869 as one of its many whimsical structures intended as a lookout to the reservoir to the north (now the Great Lawn) and the Ramble to the south. Belvedere provides the best and highest views of the Park and its cityscape. It's fitting, considering its name translates to \"beautiful view\" in Italian.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\"Right now, the temperature in Central Park is...\" Since 1919, the National Weather Service has taken measurements onf New York's weather from the castle's tower with the aid of scientific instruments that measure wind speed and direction. In a fenced-in compound just south of the castle, other data such as the rainfall is recorded and sent to the weather service's forecast office at Brookhaven National Library on Long Island. After decades of deterioration, Central Park Conservancy renovated and reopened the castle in 1983 as a visitor center.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park at 79th Street<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506618184\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Details<\/p> <p><b>Open Hours:<\/b><\/p> <p>10am-5pm daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day<\/p> <p><b>Phone:<\/b>\u00a0[masked]<\/p> <p>\n\nBethesda Fountain<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/bethesda-fountain-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Rising from Bethesda Terrace is Bethesda Fountain, with the famous Angel of the Waters statue atop. The statue references the Gospel of John, which describes an angel blessing the Pool of Bethesda and giving it healing powers. The fountain commemorates the Croton water system, which first brought fresh water to New York City in 1842. The angel carries a lily in her left hand \u2014\u00a0a symbol of the water's purity, very important to a city that had previously suffered from a devastating cholera epidemic before the system was established. The piece is the only statue that was commissioned for the Park. Created by Emma Stebbins, it also marked the first time a woman received a public art commission in New York City.<\/p> <p><br\/>Mid-Park on the north side of 72nd Street<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>SUBWAY DIRECTION :\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>TAKE # 6 TO 96 STREET AND WALK TOWARDS TO\u00a0Madison Ave or Take M 86 bus from there.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bus:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0M-1,M-2,M-3 and M-4 : Madison Ave bus to 96 street .\u00a0 Starbucks in corner<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TRAVEL-FOR-FREE\/events\/229664789\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"name":"CENTRAL PARK WALK : CONSERVATORY GARDEN TO SEE CHEERY BLOSSOM,NORTH WOODS-6 MILE","id":"229664789","time":1461519900000,"updated":1461803860000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1239046349000,"name":"(1) TRAVEL FOR FREE (2) ONE DAY GATEWAY TRIP MOST UNDER $50","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1427880,"urlname":"TRAVEL-FOR-FREE","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Travel Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":11,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458226790000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/f\/f\/600_9472735.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWE GOING TO WALK IN CENTRAL PARK.

There are five mixed borders of trees, shrubs and perennial plants, and five seasonal beds featuring spring bulbs that are followed by annual flower displays. A slope of woodland plants lines the western edge of this garden. At the center is sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh's lovely Frances Hodgeson Burnett Memorial Fountain, a tribute to the author of the children's book, The Secret Garden.

The North Woods is a favorite spot of birdwatchers and hikers. Free guided tours are available regularly. You can learn more about the North Woods, and the Park's other woodlands (the Ramble and the Hallett Nature Sanctuary), through one of our Woodland Discovery Programs.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>East Side to Mid-Park from 101nd - 110nd Streets.<\/p> <p><br\/>Blockhouse<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/blockhouse-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Central Park's oldest building, the Blockhouse is also the only remaining fortification of the many built in 1814 to defend against the British. It stands on the edge of a high precipice above the lower topography of Harlem. The rugged stone structure once had a sunken wooden roof and mobile cannon that could be deployed quickly. Today, the Blockhouse is empty, roofless, and securely locked.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side at 109th Street and Central Park West.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare Garden<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/shakespeare-garden-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shakespeare Garden is a four-acre landscape is named for the famed English poet and playwright. The garden is features flowers and plants mentioned in his poems and plays, with small bronze plaques scattered throughout the garden with quotes from the Bard.<\/p> <p>The garden was first conceived in the 1880s when park commissioner George Clausen asked the Park's entomologist to create a garden adjacent to the nature study center in the Swedish Cottage. In 1913, Commissioner Gaynor dedicated it officially to the works of Shakespeare. After years of neglect, Shakespeare Garden, just as most of Central Park, fell into disrepair. In 1987, Central Park Conservancy restored and expanded the garden, repaving pathways and installing rustic wooden benches and bronze plaques with quotations from the Bard's masterpiece.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side between 79th and 80th Streets.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Ramble<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/assets\/images\/2014\/things-to-see-and-do\/Ramble-750.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To use the words of Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, The Ramble is a 38-acre \"wild garden.\" \u00a0Central Park's designers imagined a tranquil spot where visitors could stroll, discover forest gardens rich with plantings, and meander along the paths. This truly is a place for the urban explorer to escape the city and get utterly lost in nature.<\/p> <p>This was one of the first parts of the Park to be built, and except for the bedrock platform, it is totally artificial. Even the water running in the stream and the adjacent Lake is turned on and off like a faucet. Some of the trees you see date back to 1859 when the Ramble was planted.<\/p> <p>Beneath the leafy canopy, you are surrounded by a thriving wildlife habitat. Because of its location on the Atlantic Flyway \u2014\u00a0the migration route birds follow in the spring and fall \u2014 the Ramble is the center of birding activity in the Park. Over 230 species have been spotted, and over 40 other species remain in the Park all year long.<\/p> <p>Every year, more than 25 million people visit Central Park, which is more than any other urban Park in the world. By working with environmental groups, the Central Park Conservancy has developed a woodland restoration and management plan, which involves your participation as well.<\/p> <p>First, \"carry in, carry out.\" \u00a0All of the trash and recycling bins have been removed from inside the Ramble, and placed at the entrances. If you enjoy a picnic in this beautiful setting, don't forget to take your leftovers with you and dispose of them properly. It's a simple gesture, but it really helps the environment and the Conservancy staff responsible for its care.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park from 73rd to 79th Streets.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506619071\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nBelvedere Castle<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/belvedere-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Calvert Vaux, co-designer of Central Park, created the miniature castle in 1869 as one of its many whimsical structures intended as a lookout to the reservoir to the north (now the Great Lawn) and the Ramble to the south. Belvedere provides the best and highest views of the Park and its cityscape. It's fitting, considering its name translates to \"beautiful view\" in Italian.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\"Right now, the temperature in Central Park is...\" Since 1919, the National Weather Service has taken measurements onf New York's weather from the castle's tower with the aid of scientific instruments that measure wind speed and direction. In a fenced-in compound just south of the castle, other data such as the rainfall is recorded and sent to the weather service's forecast office at Brookhaven National Library on Long Island. After decades of deterioration, Central Park Conservancy renovated and reopened the castle in 1983 as a visitor center.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park at 79th Street<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506618184\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Details<\/p> <p><b>Open Hours:<\/b><\/p> <p>10am-5pm daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day<\/p> <p><b>Phone:<\/b>\u00a0[masked]<\/p> <p>\n\nBethesda Fountain<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/bethesda-fountain-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Rising from Bethesda Terrace is Bethesda Fountain, with the famous Angel of the Waters statue atop. The statue references the Gospel of John, which describes an angel blessing the Pool of Bethesda and giving it healing powers. The fountain commemorates the Croton water system, which first brought fresh water to New York City in 1842. The angel carries a lily in her left hand \u2014\u00a0a symbol of the water's purity, very important to a city that had previously suffered from a devastating cholera epidemic before the system was established. The piece is the only statue that was commissioned for the Park. Created by Emma Stebbins, it also marked the first time a woman received a public art commission in New York City.<\/p> <p><br\/>Mid-Park on the north side of 72nd Street<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>SUBWAY DIRECTION :\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>TAKE # 6 TO 96 STREET AND WALK TOWARDS TO 5th Ave or Take M 86 bus from there.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bus:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0M-1,M-2,M-3 and M-4 : Madison Ave bus to 96 street.

Please come with a point of view, a spirit of fellow, and an open mind. As always, I look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>Christina<\/p> <p>***Book Synopsis***<\/p> <p>At some point, every one of us embarks on a\u00a0journey to find love. We meet people, date, get\u00a0into and out of relationships, all with the hope\u00a0of finding someone with whom we share a deep\u00a0connection. This seems standard now, but it\u2019s\u00a0wildly different from what people did even just\u00a0decades ago. Single people today have more\u00a0romantic options than at any point in human\u00a0history. With technology, our abilities to connect\u00a0with and sort through these options are staggering.\u00a0So why are so many people frustrated?<\/p> <p>Some of our problems are unique to our time.\u00a0\u201cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\u201d\u00a0\u201cShould I go out with this girl even though she\u00a0listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?\u00a0Combos?!\u201d \u201cMy girlfriend just got a message from\u00a0some dude named Nathan. Who\u2019s Nathan? Did he\u00a0just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check\u00a0just to be sure?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>But the transformation of our romantic lives\u00a0can\u2019t be explained by technology alone. In a short\u00a0period of time, the whole culture of finding love\u00a0has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,\u00a0people would find a decent person who lived in\u00a0their neighborhood. Their families would meet\u00a0and, after deciding neither party seemed like a\u00a0murderer, they would get married and soon have\u00a0a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,\u00a0people marry later than ever and spend years of\u00a0their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a\u00a0soul mate.<\/p> <p>For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his\u00a0comic insight at modern romance, but for<i>Modern\u00a0Romance<\/i>, the book, he decided he needed to take\u00a0things to another level. He teamed up with NYU\u00a0sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive\u00a0research project, including hundreds of interviews\u00a0and focus groups conducted everywhere from\u00a0Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed\u00a0behavioral data and surveys and created their own\u00a0online research forum on Reddit, which drew\u00a0thousands of messages. They enlisted the world\u2019s\u00a0leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen\u00a0Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry\u00a0Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any\u00a0social science or humor book we\u2019ve seen before.<\/p> <p>In\u00a0<i>Modern Romance<\/i>, Ansari combines his\u00a0irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science\u00a0to give us an unforgettable tour of our new\u00a0romantic world.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n***Where to Find the Book***<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari\/dp\/1594206279\/ref=pd_sim_14_8?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41LaBpUJBHL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR105%2C160_&amp;refRID=00FFRN2NA8HAYVQ9E87T\">Amazon<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/modern-romance-aziz-ansari\/1120655609?ean=9781594206276\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/brooklyn.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/11863362062_modern_romance\">Brooklyn Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/eoplsrv3.eopl.org\/search\/X?SEARCH=modern+romance+aziz+ansari&amp;searchscope=6\">East Orange Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huemanbookstore.com\/book\/9781594206276\">Hue-Man Bookstore<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/browse.nypl.org\/iii\/encore\/record\/C__Rb20617220__SModern%20Romance__Orightresult__U__X7;jsessionid=0F401F9524079E11599EEAEF34DDC53F?lang=eng&amp;suite=def\">New York Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.npl.org\/search~S1?\/Xmodern+romance+aziz+ansari&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=DZ\/Xmodern+romance+aziz+ansari&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=modern+romance+aziz+ansari\/1%2C3%2C3%2CB\/frameset&amp;FF=Xmodern+romance+aziz+ansari&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C\">Newark Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.queenslibrary.org\/node\/1845529\">Queens Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SistersUptown\">Sisters Uptown Bookstore<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.strandbooks.com\/humor\/modern-romance-1594206279\/_\/searchString\/modern%20romance\">The Strand Bookstore<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club\/events\/228970469\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"\"Modern Romance\" by Aziz Ansari","id":"228970469","time":1461520800000,"updated":1461532767000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1228498177000,"name":"Uptown Girl's Harlem Book Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1333170,"urlname":"Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Uptown Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"302 W. 51st Street","name":"House of Brews","lon":-73.98616,"id":10279712,"state":"NY","lat":40.76302,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.923523843288,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460647460000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/6\/7\/600_443553895.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Why just paint when you can Tipsy Paint?

centuries and millenia, humans have been becoming increasingly non-violent.\u00a0 And, looking back, we observe that values have been becoming increasingly like our own.\u00a0 Some extrapolate this trend to conclude that it means that the future will bring more of what we like, even labeling anyone who disagrees with us as \"on the wrong side of history\".\u00a0 But if we look at the present through the eyes of the past and extrapolate from that, we are led to the conclusion that<b><a href=\"https:\/\/xyquarx.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/27\/the-unacceptability-of-the-future\/\"> the future

University, and, as a result, has his name on many of the school's institutions and buildings.<\/p> <p>He was also frankly very racist, by modern standards.\u00a0 He was strongly pro-segregation, and a fan of the KKK.<\/p> <p>As a result, students are protesting and demanding that <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/news-desk\/princeton-and-the-fight-over-woodrow-wilsons-legacy\">his

is afoot to purge Harvard University of the names of dead people whose beliefs and actions fail to pass muster by contemporary standards<\/a><\/b>.<\/p> <p>Basically what's happened is that universities are running out of live bigots to purge, so they're moving on to the dead ones.\u00a0 The McCarthy Era only lasted a few years, and ran its course before they exhausted their supply of live leftists to torment, but had it drawn on for a few decades, they probably would have eventually started purging dead ones, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>As tonight's first topic illustrates, we have no idea what the values of people in the future will be, hence even less idea of how we will look in their eyes.<\/p> <p>But I will make a prediction: the present diet of most Americans will be thoroughly morally unacceptable to people 100 years from now.\u00a0 Raising beef for food requires huge amounts of land and resources, and will be unsustainable as the population grows.\u00a0 What's more, we will develop ways to grow meat substitutes in vats, which will be cheaper, tastier, more nutritious, and safer in terms of pathogens than eating real meat is now.\u00a0 No one will eat meat.\u00a0 And how will these people view us?\u00a0 To them, the moral compromises necessary to kill animals for our food, especially when we know full well that we could survive, cheaply and in good health, as vegetarians, will seem depraved and repugnant to them.\u00a0 Will they purge our names from public records as a shameful memory?<\/p> <p>While Europe was in the dark ages, the knowledge of the ancient Greeks was preserved in libraries in the Middle East.\u00a0 Where would we be now if the prophet Mohammed had decreed that the ancient Greeks, being polytheists (he couldn't <i><b>stand<\/b><\/i> polytheists), and being tolerant of gays, were a \"debased\" influence, and ordered all memory of them purged from Islamic libraries?<\/p>

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Holistic-and-Spiritual-Weight-Loss-Meetup-NY\/events\/230306598\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics  (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"230306598","time":1461620700000,"updated":1461626745000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411675865000,"name":"Holistic and Spiritual Weight Loss Meetup NYC","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":17212242,"urlname":"Holistic-and-Spiritual-Weight-Loss-Meetup-NY","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"520 8th Avenue (Btwn 36th & 37th street) 16th floor, by the Cafe, Manhattan, NY","name":"Ripley Grier Studios","lon":-73.971252,"id":24374318,"state":"NY","lat":40.783062,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.49118804932,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461245780000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join Italian Boot Camp for a free hour of immersion into \"La Bella Lingua.\" Every week or so, we will dive into a different area of discussion and grammar touch\/discuss different areas of vital Italian grammar, with time to conversation and ask questions.

Space is limited so RSVP early. Jesse Freeman will be presenting the following talk:<\/p> <p><b>From Game Jam to Appstore<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>A lot of people will tell you how to earn a living by making games, but for many of us the joy comes from the process of building a game itself. For me, making games has become an obsession. Like the guy who is building a boat in his basement without thinking of how to get it out when it's finished I pour hours of my personal time into making games. I never think about my games being successful or making me rich. I make games because there is no other way I would want to spend my time! That\u2019s why I love game jams and most of the games I make come from them. But when the jam is over, if I want people to play and enjoy my creation I have to get it out to the masses.<\/p> <p>In this talk we'll explore the obsessive nature of game development and the desire to be successful. We\u2019ll focus on how to take a raw jam game and polish it up into something ready to ship. Not every game has to be a monetary success to be rewarding. In most cases you'll find that just completing the game is satisfaction enough. Making games for fun - like any artistic expression - is as much about the journey as the destination.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/230264742\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":3600000,"name":"Talk: From Game Jam to Appstore","id":"230264742","time":1461621600000,"updated":1461645143000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"White Plains","address_1":"100 Hartsdale Ave ","name":"Ralph Field","lon":-73.765785,"id":24121311,"state":"NY","lat":41.010189,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.5002098083,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459971001000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Players of all skill levels are welcome.

Description:<br\/>For centuries, physics and philosophy walked side by side in pursuit of their shared goal\u2014understanding the nature of reality. The progress of science has pushed the frontier of physics into the realm of advanced mathematics, which requires technical skill and levels of abstraction attainable only after years of dedicated training. At the same time, most physicists today do not receive training in philosophy and epistemology, few have the time to ponder philosophical implications of their work, and some even doubt the possibility of a meaningful dialog between physicists and philosophers. However, at its core, physics addresses the fundamental problems that shape our philosophical outlook. Join our distinguished panel including writer Jim Holt, philosophers Tim Maudlin and David Z. Albert, and science writer Kate Becker in a dialogue that explores the philosophical meaning of the theories of modern physics\u2014including quantum field theory, cosmology, and quantum gravity\u2014and considers the ability of physics as a scientific discipline to answer the question: how can it be like that?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-and-nature\/events\/229725384\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":6300000,"name":"NYAS: Where Do Physics and Philosophy Intersect?","id":"229725384","time":1461624300000,"updated":1461631907000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1366528561000,"name":"Science & Nature","group_lon":-74,"id":8152742,"urlname":"science-and-nature","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"science & nature lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"25B Carmine Street","name":"Scalabrini Center","lon":-74.002945,"id":22300572,"state":"NY","lat":40.730225,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.52849030495,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453132072000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>1 hour conversation in Italian<br\/>-Native Italian Instructor<br\/>-Friendly atmosphere and people<\/p> <p><br\/>Monday February 1 \u2013 June 13, 2016<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Elementary II\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0 <b>6:45pm -7:45pm <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Advanced<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>8pm-9pm<\/b><\/p> <p>To sign up for Elementary II or Advanced class click here:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/new-york-city-parla-italiano-spring-session-2016elementary-ii-and-advanced-tickets-20825592909\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/new-york-city-parla-italiano-spring-session-2016elementary-ii-and-advanced-tickets-20825592909<\/a><\/p> <p>RSVP: [masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>If you come from an Italian family, you\u2019ll discover more about your heritage.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p><b><i><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCpb425\">Personal Branding with Purpose<\/a><\/i><\/b> is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand.

By learning how to market these gifts through personal branding, you create not only career and business opportunities but also a greater capacity to make a difference in the lives of others and the planet.<\/p> <p><b>======================================<\/b><\/p> <p><b>** OFFICIAL RSVP on Eventbrite.

And, it doesn't stop there--walls, everyday objects, and your work and home environs will soon be able to listen, talk, engage, and get things done with you. For purposes of GTDers, there are so many ways in which this impacts our personal productivity! That's the topic of discussion for this month's Meetup. We will discuss how IoT is currently in our lives, where IoT can benefit our GTD systems, and potential pitfalls to circumnavigate so you can stay on track with getting things done.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please feel free to bring your copy of GTD for reference, your questions and thoughts on IoT as well!<\/p> <p><b>III.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

The progress of science has pushed the frontier of physics into the realm of advanced mathematics, which requires technical skill and levels of abstraction attainable only after years of dedicated training. At the same time, most physicists today do not receive training in philosophy and epistemology, few have the time to ponder philosophical implications of their work, and some even doubt the possibility of a meaningful dialog between physicists and philosophers. However, at its core, physics addresses the fundamental problems that shape our philosophical outlook. Join our distinguished panel including writer Jim Holt, philosophers Tim Maudlin and David Z. Albert, and science writer Kate Becker in a dialogue that explores the philosophical meaning of the theories of modern physics\u2014including quantum field theory, cosmology, and quantum gravity\u2014and considers the ability of physics as a scientific discipline to answer the question: how can it be like that?<\/p> <p>* Reception to follow.<\/p> <p><i><b>Featuring:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>David Z.

Just months from \"aging out\" of the child welfare system, and close to being kicked out of her foster home, a community service position helping an elderly woman clean out her home is the only thing keeping her out of juvie and worse.\u00a0Vivian Daly has lived a quiet life on the coast of Maine. But in her attic, hidden in trunks, are vestiges of a turbulent past. As she helps Vivian sort through her possessions and memories, Molly discovers that she and Vivian aren't as different as they seem to be. A young Irish immigrant orphaned in New York City, Vivian was put on a train to the Midwest with hundreds of other children whose destinies would be determined by luck and chance.<\/p> <p><br\/>The closer Molly grows to Vivian, the more she discovers parallels to her own life. A Penobscot Indian, she, too, is an outsider being raised by strangers, and she, too, has unanswered questions about the past. As her emotional barriers begin to crumble, Molly discovers that she has the power to help Vivian find answers to mysteries that have haunted her for her entire life - answers that will ultimately free them both.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Thank you Nan.\u00a0\u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014<\/p> <p><br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

If the submitted bid wins, the user is shown an ad. Advertisers hope that ad-exposure leads to an increased likelihood of a desired action, such as a click or conversion (purchase, etc). So an important quantity that advertisers want to measure is the causal effect of advertising, namely, what is the response probability of an exposed user, compared with the counterfactual (un-observable) response-rate of the user if they were not exposed to the ad.\u00a0 In an ideal randomized test, the user is randomly assigned to test or control AFTER the submitted bid is won, and test users are served the ad in the normal way, while control users are not. While this is ideal from a statistical perspective, in practice this approach has the drawback that money spent by advertisers is wasted when a user is assigned to control. \u00a0At MediaMath we have developed a methodology for causal effect measurement where users are assigned to test or control BEFORE bid submission. One challenge here is that not all test-group users are exposed to an ad; only a winning bid results in ad exposure, and the winning population can have a significant bias. This talk will describe our approach to handle this and other challenges to ad impact measurement in this setting, and how we use MCMC Gibbs sampling to arrive at confidence intervals for ad-impact.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Prasad Chalasani is\u00a0 the S.V.P. of Data Science at MediaMath, leading the development of innovative, proprietary scalable algorithms, and analytics that leverage massive amounts of data to power smarter digital marketing for the world\u2019s leading advertisers.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

Timothy Walker, director of the Oxford University Botanic Garden, reveals how the breakthroughs of Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, Chelsea gardener Phillip Miller and English naturalist John Ray created the science of botany. Between them these quirky, temperamental characters unlocked the mysteries of the plant kingdom and they began to glimpse a world where bigger, better and stronger plants could be created. Nurseryman Thomas Fairchild created the world's first artificial hybrid flower - an entirely new plant that\u00a0didn't exist in nature. Today, botanists continue the search for new flowers, better crops and improved medicines to treat life-threatening diseases.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information call[masked]\u00a0or email [masked].<\/p> <p>Sponsored by the Indoor Gardening Society of New York<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About the Indoor Gardening Society<\/b>...<\/p> <p>IGS is a great way to introduce adults and children to the importance of green plants.

Also, because we have our own party space reserved, attendance is limited to the capacity of the room. So your name must be on the guest list to attend.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PLUS ONES<br\/>There are no plus ones on the guest list. We encourage you to bring along other industry-related professionals who should RSVP as a separate attendee. Because the goal of this event is to have a chance to meet and mingle with new people, we kindly request that non-music related plus ones are kept to a minimum because we have found that it discourages interaction among members. If you absolutely must bring a non-music plus one, they must be RSVP'd as a separate attendee.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE:<br\/>This is not a performance event or a jam session so there's no need to bring instruments or gear. There are other Meetup groups that specialize in that kind of thing. This event is an opportunity for exchanging ideas, information, and meeting other music people.

But, how about SharePoint On-line?<\/p> <p><br\/>Microsoft is kind enough to provide us with a suite of PowerShell commands called 'SharePoint Online management shell'. SharePoint Online Management Shell is a Windows PowerShell module that you can use to efficiently manage SharePoint Online users, sites, site collections, and organizations. However, it provides very limited administrative functionality and most of the administration activities are not supported. this is where we can use the power of PowerShell with CSOM managed API. in this session I will demonstrate how .NET client OM can be used with PowerShell to manage your SharePoint Online site with ease.<\/p> <p><b>About Our Speaker:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/a\/600_449119850.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I am a hands-on technical Solutions Architect primarily focused on delivering efficient and competitive business solutions on SharePoint Technology platform.

It supports highly configurable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of NiFi's key features include a web-based user interface for monitoring and controlling data flows, guaranteed delivery, data provenance, and easy extensibility through custom processor development. These features make NiFi a perfect candidate for building production quality data pipelines that interact with Apache Solr. This talk will demonstrate how to use a NiFi processor that delivers data to a Solr update handler, as well as a processor for extracting data from Solr on regular intervals for delivery to down-stream systems.

During certain days of the year they refrain from meat consumption, similar to the Christian\u2019s Lent.\u00a0 In the traditions of Tibetan, Japanese, and Theravada such as in Thailand, some monastics eat meat.\u00a0 Due to their geographic and cultural circumstance, meat consumption is a mainstay. \u00a0<\/p> <p>For the Tibetans, they live in a nomadic culture high in the mountains where vegetables are not available year round.\u00a0 Note that now many temples in the Tibetan tradition now forbid meat in their kitchens and many monastics are now vegetarian.\u00a0 For the Theravada traditions, monastics must go for alms begging, where they eat whatever that\u2019s given to them which may include meat.\u00a0 The meat should be the left over and the monastics cannot eat meat where the animals are specifically killed for them. \u00a0<\/p> <p>In terms of karmic retribution, the killing of another human being is the most serious, grave prohibitions or parajikas, and does not permit repentance, whereas the killing of other animals the karmic retribution is less severe. \u00a0There is also the intent of killing other animal, such as if it is the only to sustain one's life. \u00a0There are even some Tantra text referencing meat offerings, though some commentaries states that \u201cmeat\u201d references solid food.\u00a0 And there are plenty of Tantra texts that states don\u2019t eat meat. \u00a0<\/p> <p>While there are many reasons for eating meat, for the practitioners, it is important to reflect upon their own actions, to be mindful as to diminish suffering of others.\u00a0 <b>Tibetan Monk Matthew Ricard, Ph D<\/b>, recommends everyone to watch Earthling and Food Inc documentaries, \u201cWatch with open mind .. any decent human beings \u2026 just can\u2019t do it (eat meat)\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n_\/|\\_<\/p> <p>Eddie<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core Teachings, Venerable Master Hsing Yun<\/p> <p>Zen Wisdom, Chan Master Sheng Yen<\/p> <p>A Manual of Buddhism, Venerable Narada Maha Thera<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shabkar.org\/download\/video\/Matthieu_Ricard_02.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shabkar.org\/download\/video\/Matthieu_Ricard_02.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.shabkar.org\/download\/video\/Matthieu_Ricard_02.htm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tonglen.oceandrop.org\/Karma_&amp;_Eating_Meat.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tonglen.oceandrop.org\/Karma_&amp;_Eating_Meat.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tonglen.oceandrop.org\/Karma_&amp;_Eating_Meat.htm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n---- Kailash Parbat ----<\/p> <p>Kailash Parbat is an international vegetarian\/vegan chain with restaurants in Mumbai, Singapore, London and now New York. \u00a0While you may see many southern Indian veg restaurant in Curry Hill serving dosa, this restaurant comes from the Sindhi tradition and it is famous for their street food chaat. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be inside!

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/230506489\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvgbjc","time":1461709800000,"updated":1461767938000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"177 Mulberry Street","name":"Grotta Azzurra Restaurant","lon":-73.99688,"id":6579692,"state":"NY","lat":40.720428,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.07919716835,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460911896000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/3\/8\/600_436093368.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Join us for an incredible private wine tasting with several other similar Meetup groups.
