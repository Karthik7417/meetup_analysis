You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how to acquire that state of mind which will attract riches.

She was a child prodigy at the Paris Conservatory who worked with four famous French composers: Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, and Maurice Ravel (we have information in the French School archives to validate this).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Mlle. Combe won first place in a competition in the Paris Conservatory at age 13. When she played for Debussy, he conceded her interpretation of one of his pieces&nbsp;<\/span>improved<span>&nbsp;it so much that he instructed his&nbsp;<\/span>publisher<span>&nbsp;to make certain changes to his printed work in the next printing. She performed Saint-Sa\u00ebns' second concerto with Saint-Sa\u00ebns conducting the orchestra, at age 15 in 1907. That same year, though, she fractured her wrist in a bike accident. Because it was improperly set, she had to give up her budding career as a solo concert pianist and turned to teaching, setting up her first school in Switzerland.&nbsp;<\/span><span>It was Sergey Rachmaninov who advocated to the US State Department that she be allowed to emigrate to the US to bring solfege to this country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Through Claude Debussy, the lineage of musicality continues up through Franz Liszt, Carl Czerny, and Ludwig van Beethoven (you can Google this in the Wikipedia pages). So former students of Mlle. Combe and her students (including Stephen Waters and more) are musical descendants of these famous composers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was Mlle. Combe's piano student from 1972 - 1982 and performed at Carnegie Recital Hall nine times as a child. My little sister performed there ten times, and many of my classmates did as well. Alumni during the 1970s who went professional musically have worked with Zubin Mehta and Constance Keene, studied at Juilliard (seven classmates that I know of including myself) and other conservatories (five that I know of), and become worldwide concertizing artists, professors at conservatories, resident composers and artists. One alumna after my time is now a professional singer who has sung in many famous movies.<\/p>\n<p>Those alumni during my time who did not become professional musicians became doctors, lawyers, technologists (like myself), entrepreneurs, executives, educators, etc. Some crossed over, becoming professional performers and entrepreneurs \/ technologists. It turns out we didn't just learn about music. We learned about discipline, self-control, attention to detail, perseverance, standards of excellence, and how to pick ourselves up and continue on when we ran into challenges. These are universally valuable skills that affect every aspect of one's life - personally and professionally.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds intimidating, doesn't it? Here's the thing: were we a bunch of freaky Mozart genius kids?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Oh heck no.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What happened was that we were given wildly efficient and effective piano practice methods, solfege lessons to develop our understanding of music, and insights from a teacher who knew exactly what the French composers intended with their compositions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who are part of the French School of Music family were given an extraordinary opportunity, and we fully intend to pass along what we learned from Mlle.

Appearances and surface beliefs will not be judged. I only wish that everyone joins with the intent to learn and grow, in the name of God.

Everyone is willing to practice with each other and with a Mandrain Chinese native speaker. I teach Chinese 15+ years, and graduated from the\u201cChinese Teacher Training Program\u201din 2008. You should be able to speak and understand at least a little Chinese or you won't be able to participate the conversation. In this Meetup, every week I choose a different topic as a starting point for our conversation. I will post the topic on each Meetup page at least one day before the Meetup. If there is more than one meeting in a week, it will be the same topic, you can try once again or attend next week for the new topic. I will use part of textbooks or media videos to help discuss. RSVP required. RSVP closed the day before every meetup. Min. 2 people, max. 10 people per Meetup (+ me). RSVPs are final: RSVP only if you can come. If something comes up and you can't make it please change your RSVP to \"no\" so I know who is coming. All meeting will be around Middle East Manhattan. But if you recommend some nice places as well, please do tell me. ---- What's more, there are 3 kinds of Chinese classes that I can offer: -Business: focus on the field that you work in. -Travelling: training of the communication of daily life. -Specialize\/Academic Conference: shortly translation, speech training,etc. For private lessons please contact me personally.

Within this work, we access the deeper aspects of our true nature and start the journey of inherently trusting our intuitive sense. This sense of trust not only manifests within the practice, but also permeates throughout the rest of our lives. This kind of attention to the body changes the way we habitually think and react. It encourages us to develop the skills of deep listening, witnessing, and compassion with our inner selves as well as with others. The beauty of this practice is that it can be practiced by anyone with a willingness to show up and be present. There\u2019s no need to be a \u201cdancer\u201d or an \u201cartist\u201d or etc. By simply showing up and being present, so much work has already been done.

Welcome the word\u2019s first drinking club dedicated to bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats. Ideally, this Meetup aims to foster meaningful political discussions\u2014and hopefully camaraderie\u2014between people with opposing viewpoints. At the very least, it hopes to bring together people who share an interest in American politics. In order for this Meetup to be successful, we must keep these goals in mind:<\/p>\n<p>1. In order to generate interesting discussions, we need a mix of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Preaching to the choir is not as fun\u2014or as constructive\u2014as debating issues. Consequently, since New York City is majority-Democrat, reaching out to non-liberals is a priority.<\/p>\n<p>2. We need good topics to discuss at every Meetup. Topics can be specific or general. Possible topics include: privately-funded healthcare vs. publically-funded healthcare, interventionism vs. isolationism, conservatism vs. mainstream republicanism, Bernie vs. Hillary, Trump vs. the establishment, pragmatism vs. idealism, deportation vs. path to citizenship, flat tax vs. graduated tax, security vs. privacy, mental health reform vs. gun control, voter fraud vs. voter suppression, gerrymandering, student loans, the death penalty, women in combat, the pay gap, drug policy, welfare, the minimum wage, labor unions, education policy, terrorism, Israel, Iran, Syria\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3. We need to be able to respectfully discuss our differences. We\u2019ll see whether alcohol helps or hinders achievement of this goal.<\/p>\n<p>4. We need to not ONLY talk about politics. We also want to get to know each other and make new friends. Alcohol will definitely prove helpful in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>5. We need to welcome people of various knowledge levels. Those with a lot of knowledge need to be both teachers and debaters.<\/p>\n<p><span>More to come!

That's it. No speed dating, speaker series, Bible study, joint socials with non-Catholic groups, or anything else. There are other Catholic groups that have those things covered. But unlike those groups, this group will not be tied to any particular parishes. We will get to experience Mass in as many Catholic churches as we can, as many different neighborhoods as we can, even as the number of Catholic churches in New York dwindles. Many of these churches have amazing stories to tell down through the generations.<\/p>\n<p>This is neither a liberal nor conservative Catholic group so please keep politics out of it. I'm most interested in meeting my fellow Catholic single young and not-so-young-anymore (20s, 30s, 40s) adults, but all ages are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the words of Pope Francis in mind: \"...big cities are a reminder of the hidden riches present in our world: in the diversity of its cultures, traditions and historical experiences.

With this method we can \u201cdiagnose\u201d and make visible the patterns and blockages which have followed us from the past. The most healing approach to those traumas is not to run away and to forget, but to bring them out. Like the vampire that disintegrates into dust when brought out to the sun \u2013 the traumatic story, when brought out to the conscious level, stops programming our behavior and becomes a valuable experience and knowledge. This practice will give you a chance to work on your personal problems and to serve as a helper in other people\u2019s constellations. The experience of participating in somebody else's constellation gives you deep knowledge of the family relationship structure. This practice brings valuable wisdom to the participant, opens their heart and vision. The Family Constellation method effectively addresses: \u2022 relationship problems \u2022 career issues \u2022 business and financial difficulties \u2022 bodily pain and illness \u2022 depression \u2022 habitual emotional and behavioral patterns When we experience depression, emotional instability, problems with our relationship or career, a common practice is to search for an answer within the realm of our own views and personal history. However, in some cases these issues arise not from personal history, but from our ancestral memories - from the traumas which happened several generations before us. We perceive such traumas as an atmosphere of pressure, danger or threat which affects our feelings and actions. A person with a traumatized \u201cfamily field\u201d intuitively feels that his\/her family energy is too \u201cheavy\u201d and rejects it, putting a barrier between them and their family energy. In a case like this the negative energies are partially blocked, but the power of the family and ancestors\u2019 blessings are blocked as well. In order to move forward you need to feel safety at your back. It is not easy to understand and heal wounds which came from the past. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what happened generations ago. If we do know some stories we feel they are not too important \u2013 we see them as grandmother\u2019s tales of the far past. Those traumas manifest as a tense and heavy atmosphere in our relationships with parents, spouses or kids. They can also manifest as repeated patterns of events in our life.

When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". \n\nTop reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:\n\n1.

And so I am calling all fiction writers focused on writing about the African continent (either based in Africa or about African characters). This is for you if you are already working on something professionally or as a hobby and could use the feedback from a group of other writers with similar interests.

We are love, we are grace, we are one with everything in creation. Please come and celebrate who you are in a community of loving, light -filled beautiful souls.

Your work day is 12 hours with commuting. You sleep maybe 6 hours a night. The rest of the time is taking care of the kids, spouse, dog, cat, partner, laundry, shopping, cleaning and a few other errands that you've been putting off for weeks. How do you fit one hour of exercise a day into that schedule? You don't. That's why a few pounds accumulate each year right after the holidays that you can't seem to get off before summer. This group is about 15 minute workouts that get results (indoors and out). Nutrition tips that you can actually do. Work smarter and more efficiently without spinning your wheels.

This work is based on the simple physics of vulnerability: If we are brave enough, often enough, we will fall. What does that mean? We all have a story about an experience; a situation, a conversation that made us feel bad, sad, hurt, and ashamed. It can be a story of personal heartbreak, a story from our childhood, a relationship and\/or a professional struggle. It's the story where we think we are not good enough; smart enough, thin enough, or even not worthy of being loved. That we\u2019re a bad friend, parent, spouse, boss, son, or daughter. When we don't resolve these feelings, they stop us from having courage in our day-to-day lives. Who should take this workshop? This work is for anyone that wants to: - Explore a story of struggle - Get curious about the emotions that keep us stuck in our story - Learn how owning our story of struggle gives us the power to write a brave new ending How does Rising Strong work? The work is broken down into three acts and is facilitated through discussion, video and written exercises. Act I: The Reckoning \u2013 We Walk Into Our Story. Act II: The Rumble \u2013 Owning Our Story. Act III: The Revolution \u2013 Process Becomes Practice. We write a new ending to our story based on our key learnings and use this new, braver story to change how we engage with the world and to ultimately transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":106571132,"name":"Susan G.

It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.&nbsp; <br> <br>Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity&nbsp; <br> <br><b>What is Sahaja Meditation?&nbsp;<\/b> <br> <br>How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.&nbsp; <br> <br>How does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.&nbsp; <br> <br>Once awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Overview.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.&nbsp; <br> <br>If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.&nbsp; <br> <br>Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.&nbsp; <br> <br>There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>The power of collective meditation<\/b>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12422128,"name":"Alan Wherry","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/highres_253437724.jpeg","photo_id":253437724,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/member_253437724.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/thumb_253437724.jpeg"}},"members":62,"name":"Meditation Classes, Kingsbridge NYPL, Bronx - Always Free","id":19471790,"state":"NY","urlname":"Meditation-Kingsbridge-Library-Bronx-Always-Free","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454218552000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"black-entrepreneurs","name":"Black Entrepreneurs","id":16348},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Women-Minority-Business-MWBE-Train-Bid-Sell-Contract-Career\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Thank you for your interest in this new community of minority, women, and other diversity group members who are either currently or seeking to become a \u201d government certified (M\/WBE) business enterprise, and\/ or simply desiring to explore other methodologies of business capitalization, growth, utilizing tech and new media to develop new business and career opportunities. <br><\/p>\n<p>Note, that City, State, and Federal government agencies are required by law to award a certain annual percentage of their contracts to Certified M\/WBE business enterprises.

Because we're all busy, we'll keep this meetings to an hour, and because a group like this is best when it's focused, this group is for people who make a living primarily as freelance reporters, essayists and editors, rather than in the realm of fiction or poetry.","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":54410882,"name":"Libby Copeland","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/1\/d\/highres_250537917.jpeg","photo_id":250537917,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/1\/d\/member_250537917.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/1\/d\/thumb_250537917.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Westchester Freelance Journalists Meetup","id":19495007,"state":"NY","urlname":"Westchester-Freelance-Journalists-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.9700012207,"who":"Freelance journos"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454450155000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"seo-search-engine-optimization","name":"SEO (Search Engine Optimization)","id":23199},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrainStation-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"We host technology workshops and courses for various skill levels that are instructed by BrainStation's talented educators and students.

Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 40-50 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Let's help each other to make space and time to create the life we want to live by decluttering, curating, and editing your life to a life that you would be proud of. (Plus, a life that is more sustainable &amp; environmentally friendly via minimalism) This group is for support, inspiration, and motivation!<\/p>\n<p>Here people who deal with issues such as minimalist lifestyle, sustainability and reduced consumption meet. The 5 Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle are an important part of the way of thinking in everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup group in New York City will host meetings in all 5 boroughs for everyone who wants to discover, learn more or share their experiences with minimalism. Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what adds value to their lives. By clearing the clutter from life's path, we can all make room for the most important aspects of life: health, relationships, passion, growth, and contribution. There are many flavors of minimalism: a twenty-year-old single guy's minimalist lifestyle looks different from a forty-five-year-old mother's minimalist life. Even though everyone embraces minimalism differently, each path leads to the same place: a more purposeful and deliberate life.<\/p>\n<p>If this speaks to you, join in the upcoming conversations! You can attend by yourself or bring a friend\/partner!<\/p>\n<p>An introduction to minimalism starts here: <br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theminimalists.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.theminimalists.com\/<\/a> <br><a href=\"http:\/\/theminimalists.com\/podcast\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/theminimalists.com\/podcast<\/a> <br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iKhQ75DfD2k\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iKhQ75DfD2k<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NewYorkCityMinimalismGroup\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NewYorkCityMinimalismGroup\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/464826070394574\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/464826070394574\/<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this group, it is not about to reach a consensus or to solve the problems of the world.

You can expect to network with other businesses, speakers and social media enthusiasts while learning new tricks and tips of the trade.

When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1. It is Free of Charge. Because It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>2. It is simple and easy.<\/p>\n<p>Do not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday. 3.

You can literally travel around the world in NY without even getting on a plane. Exploring different ethnic neighborhoods and sampling their delicious ethnic dishes is a must, whether you live in NYC or are just visiting.

But we're looking for more than just plodding through 6 standard \"slow blues\" in 6 different keys and another 6 standard \"shuffle blues\" in the other 6, with random solos, etc. You should be familiar and comfortable with your instrument and the common traditional blues forms and riffs, and be able to build and expand on them.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>We like to focus on interesting and perhaps original interpretations of a lot of 'one off' sorts of blues and RnB material, verging into jazz, rock, pop and fusion jazz, etc. Of course there will be enough raunchy 1\/4\/5's, but we'll start by trying to nail the particular factors - certain riffs, rhythms and nuances - that distinguish one from the other and characterize certain artists and styles, and\/or our own style, should we be able to develop one. That said, we hope the music will be \"open\" as well - fluid and loose, played with confidence and an adventurous spirit - both good licks and mistakes included. Call it 'the jazz spirit\" - not a \"cover band\" by any means and we're not really song-based at all - songs generally only provide a starting point for what we like to do. That's how we learn and grow as musicians.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for a drummer, a couple of guitarists who know how to play in an ensemble and not just wax into long solos, vocalists, keys, a good electric harp player. Brass and reeds that can fit into the format are also more than welcome. I am in Brooklyn, so musicians in NYC area with easy access to a venue in Manhattan or Brooklyn would be most appropriate. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I've been playing bass for many years (on and off with varying degrees of dedication) - some gigs, a lot of jamming and messing around, etc. etc. &nbsp;At the moment I own six basses, mostly short scale axes, although this count tends to vary. I love playing electric blues, funk, RnB and some light jazz, fusion jazz and acid rock. I am not a sight reader, but I do know my scales and chords well enough and my chops are respectable, including first position in many keys. I practice regularly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A number of venues where I used to jam have closed or changed their orientation. So I am dying to get together with some like minded musicians (you don't have to be a boomer) to put something together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Favorites include Muddy, Butterfield, Albert King, Wilson Pickett, Luther Allison, Fabulous TBirds, William Clarke, some Dylan and what Horace Silver I'm able to negotiate. I also have a decent number of original progressions that would be probably characterized as fusion or latin flavored blues, and of course anybody else's original material that fits our parameters is welcome. (I'm a big fan of Latin rhythms. Although I'm not well acquainted with the structure and harmonies of most Latin music, I'd love to learn about it. )<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Let's Wail!<\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p>MNG<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/7\/600_446945607.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/highres_446968787.jpeg","photo_id":446968787,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/600_446968787.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/thumb_446968787.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":190181111,"name":"Mikey Gold","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/highres_254005409.jpeg","photo_id":254005409,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/member_254005409.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/thumb_254005409.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"Boomers Blues Summit","id":19565093,"state":"NY","urlname":"Boomers-Blues-Summit","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"musicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455394646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"paddling","name":"Paddling","id":726},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"exhawaiians","name":"Hawaiian Culture","id":7071},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"the-aloha-spirit","name":"The Aloha Spirit","id":24334},{"urlkey":"canoe","name":"Canoeing","id":31885},{"urlkey":"east-coast","name":"East Coast","id":43608},{"urlkey":"outrigger-canoe-paddling","name":"Outrigger Canoe Paddling","id":57253},{"urlkey":"outrigger-paddling","name":"Outrigger paddling","id":1393132},{"urlkey":"outrigger","name":"Outrigger","id":1508692},{"urlkey":"vaa","name":"Va'a","id":1508693},{"urlkey":"east-coast-outrigger","name":"East Coast Outrigger","id":1508694}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/eastcoastoutrigger\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Waterwomen and Watermen -- I Mua!<\/p>\n<p>Does the open ocean call you?

The indigenous sport survived the oppression of being outlawed by foreign settlers and pushed aside by waves of modernization. In Hawai'i, King David Kalakaua, a Hawaiian monarch, is credited for catalyzing Hawaiian cultural resurgence during the late 19th century. He restored outrigger canoe racing as a legal sport for the Hawaiian people. Around the world, outrigger canoe paddling and racing continues to grow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The international presence of outrigger canoes is marked by key stronghold races that draw the world's best competitors.

At the end of the pitch event, the money invested by the attendees will be given to the startup founders.&nbsp; <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>eg: If the we charge you $10 to attend the meetup we will give you back $5 which you can invest.

Don't you wish you can meet more people with the same taste of bands that you listen to? If you answered yes to both questions, then this meetup is for you!\n\nMy name is Wilfredo Betance Jr, and I've been going to metalcore shows throughout the past 9 years. I honestly want to meet more people that like my kind of music and that like to rock out at shows! The only time I'm around people that like my kind of music is when I go to shows, but everyone is usually with their group of friends and don't want to mingle! (weirdos lol). I thought to myself, \"if I'm having these thoughts, maybe there are others like me who feel the same way!\" The purpose of this group is create a fan-base group between us metalcore\/post-hardcore fans in the NJ\/NYC area to hang out and go to shows!\n\n------Questions you may have regarding the meetup group------\n\n1.What do you mean by metalcore\/post hardcore shows?\n\nI know people get the genres titles mixed up. To reduce any confusion, I'm going to list some of the bands I listen to so you guys have an idea of the type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\nA Day To Remember\nOur Last Night\nBullet for My Valentine\nSlipknot\nAsking Alexandra\nMemphis May Fire\nIssues\nI See Stars\nCrown the Empire\nBlack Veil Brides\nEscape The Fate\nSuicide Silence\nRise Against\nMotionless in White\nPalisades\nThe Amity Affliction\nSilvertien\nBlessthefall\nSleeping with sirens\nPierce the veil\nFalling in Reverse\nThe Word Alive\nBring Me The Horizon\nWe Came as Romans\nEmmure\nChunk! No, Captain Chuck!\n\nAlright, I can go on forever with this list! Lol. I hope this gives you guys an idea of type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\n2. How will this meetup operate?\nI'm going to post a list of shows that I'll be attending, and I'm going to list restaurants around the show's venue where we can meet up and hang before the show!\n\nIf you guys have any shows that you are attending and what to have it announced in the group, go ahead and announce it!\n\n--------Some ground Rules-------\n\n1. This isn't an advertisement platform. This is a platform for us like-minded people, with similar taste of music, to get to know one another and attend shows together!\n\n2. Don't make fun at others for listening to a particular band. Keep your comments and opinions to yourself.\n\nThe only type of advertising that's allowed\n1.

But if every person did just one thing to make the world a better place today, billions of acts of kindness, social responsibility and generosity would take place, and wouldn\u2019t that alone change the face of this planet? Let start with Supporting and supplying our undeserved neighborhoods with the tools and resources needed to sustain their lives and families. Areas of focus: Mentoring, coaching, Counseling, Linking to Resources, Case Managing and Advocating. I would like these services to be available to our communities via evenings and weekends. People shouldn't have to worry about losing a days pay to receive services. If this is an area of interest for you please join this Group.

Having a small number of members will make getting to know each other a lot easier and form friendships** <br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup events will include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Brunch<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Happy Hour<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Girls Night Out<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Dinner and Movies<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Wine Tasting<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Outdoor activities<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Cruises<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Museums <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Spa days <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Travel, Vacation, Weekend Getaways<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Shopping<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Fashion events (NYFW)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Dancing (clubs, nightlife)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Bars, hookah lounge<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Zumba, pole dancing classes lol (they are actually a lot of fun and the workout is great for every part of your body) <br><\/p>\n<p>**NOTE: Not all meetups will be planned weeks in advanced. Some will be spontaneous\/last minute. <br><\/p>\n<p>This group doesn't have a lot of \"rules\". I only ask for 3 things from each member:<\/p>\n<p>1) Attend meetups as much as possible. (Can't build friendships if you attend only once every 6 months lol) <br><\/p>\n<p>2) Avoid the FLAKY syndrome. If you RSVP Yes please follow through with that. If your rsvp changes suddenly (it's life, things happen) please change the RSVP to No. Flakiness is not allowed and will result in immediate removal of your membership for this group. That's it! Inactivity will result in removal from the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>3) Just be yourself! This group is a judgement free zone :) <br><\/p>\n<p>Stay fabulous and I look forward to meeting you! xoxo <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/highres_447432202.jpeg","photo_id":447432202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/600_447432202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/thumb_447432202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":140924122,"name":"Chelsea","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/highres_254453354.jpeg","photo_id":254453354,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/member_254453354.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/thumb_254453354.jpeg"}},"members":53,"name":"Divas in The City","id":19586705,"state":"NY","urlname":"divasinthecity","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Divas"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455758033000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"twitter","name":"Twitter","id":10834},{"urlkey":"slack","name":"Slack","id":36628},{"urlkey":"web-bot","name":"Web Bot","id":68589},{"urlkey":"automation","name":"Automation","id":93380},{"urlkey":"bots","name":"Bots","id":1508598}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/botmakers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/botmakers.org\/\">Botmakers.org<\/a> is the official community of <a href=\"https:\/\/botwiki.org\/\">Botwiki.org<\/a> users and contributors.

Good company. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;A grown-er grown &amp; sexy vibe.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 patronizing black business <br><\/p>\n<p> Are you still curious?? Just come thru. <\/p>\n<p>Why Nhappi Hour?? <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To have the hard conversations in an easier way <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To curate community, one conversation at a time <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To create a different space to meet men\/women <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To speak, listen, and share our voices and perspectives <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To party together, in a different way <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022Still curious?? R.S.V.P, and just come thru. <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br>The extended rundown: <br><\/p>\n<p>Our \"cocktails &amp; conversations\" type of event is a social collective of (mostly Black) men and women who meet up once per month, patronize a Black-owned lounge or venue (commit to spending at least $20), and have a curated conversation and exploration on a topic related to Black Love &amp; Black sociocultural issues. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour was created by 2 professional facilitators, who work consistently at the art of making conversation happen in our professional lives, and we just wanted to take it further. We decided to create a space for conversation about the state of BLACK LOVE and Black issues...but in a fun, interactive way. We are diligent about keeping the dialogue, energy and space, safe and sacred. We figured, \"Hey, if we can cultivate conversations among teens, inmates, and other populations successfully, why not bridge the gap in communication in our immediate community, starting with Black men and women?\" <br><\/p>\n<p>So yeah, <br>Nhappi Hour is an interactive experience. <br>What does that mean? <br>It means, we don't JUST sit around and talk. We all participate in activities, games, and crafts that help keep the conversation going. So if you're looking to just be a voyeur... nahhh potna'. Interactive means, YOUR voice, YOUR participation, YOUR love, matters. So, lean IN to the experience. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour is FILLED with drama. Literally. <br>We use short, entertaining skits\/scenes\/poetry\/whateva...&nbsp; performed by our facilitators to introduce the conversation, and to push to the dialogue forward. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour is perfect for singles as a cool way to meet men and women in a low pressure, cool, interactive environment. <br>But, Nhappi Hour is beneficial for dating couples and married couples as well. Your perspective in a community dialogue is a great influence on bridging the gap in communication between men and women. <br>Nhappi hour is open to all adults, but our target demographic is mid-20-40's. <br>Our conversations center around Black Heterosexual relationships, but because we do discuss broader community\/cultural issues as well, we understand that Black people of all sexual orientations can add value and perspective to the dialogue, as can folk of other races\/cultures...and so, all are welcome. <br>We just wanna be transparent- our event will be focused on the Black heterosexual agenda so don't get it twisted. <br>We're clear, you should be, too. <br> But yeah, <br>Join the discussion. <br><\/p>\n<p>NABE Harlem Downstairs (127th Street and Fred. Douglass Blvd) is our private meeting spot for the night of exciting activities and dialogue. Come thru and help us support this Black-owned business, by committing to spend at least $20. They have a full menu and full bar as well, so that should be easy (and you can always buy someone else a drink if youuuu don't drink...wink) <br> <br>RSVP today. Limited Space Available (nah, seriously though, we have the space to ourselves but the location isn't huge, so space is limited to 40).

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo. Thank You for your time and we hope to see you at our meet ups!<\/p> \n<p>Thank You for your time and we look forward to getting to know each and every one of you and hopefully have an opportunity to

In each meeting we fire up a discussion to explore your truest self in a safe, encouraging atmosphere and offer a self-reflective exercise for harnessing inner wisdom. If you\u2019re ready to hear and be heard by an awesome group of women, recharge your battery pack, and break all glass ceilings, then this is your time to RADIATE. \n\nNapoleon Hill outlined the mastermind principle beautifully in his book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d. He speaks of the group as a collection of energy--each one of us carries our own battery pack, but together, we increase our voltage and can bring more light into our lives and the world (through connecting with each other in an authentic way)!\n\nMany groups exist for networking purposes, particularly when it involves business, but Radiate Mastermind is not just about your business--it\u2019s about the business of living. We are, each of us, seeking our own path and doing the best we can to \u201cstay true\u201d to the path.

Do you enjoy playing DOTA 2 and would love to play with a regular group of people? At the same time, are you also turned off by the often immature and toxic behavior in the community and want to game with some genuinely nice and civil people? Then this&nbsp;free group for adult gamers (18+) is perfect for you! <\/strong>Imagine playing DOTA 2 with kind and&nbsp;supportive adult&nbsp;teammates!... Meeting&nbsp;fellow gamers in person&nbsp;in a comfortable and public setting&nbsp;helps makes this&nbsp;possible. We also link up online and game together from the comfort of our own homes. Part of the reason why players in pubs&nbsp;keep resorting to using&nbsp;the same&nbsp;small&nbsp;group of&nbsp;hard carries&nbsp;is because there is rarely the positive space, communication&nbsp;and teamwork needed to play a crucial support role.

Strategizing before or after the match (\u201cMaybe you could buy Boots of Travel before Assault Cuirass?\u201d \/ \u201cWe should not trilane with this hero.\u201d) is much more effective in improving skill level than blaming others during the match. <em>All levels of play are welcome, so we will naturally settle into groups of 5 that have similar playstyles and skill.<\/em> <\/p>\n<p>3) <strong>Inactive (not attending any online or in-person&nbsp;Events)&nbsp;for more than 3 months (90 days)&nbsp;and you will be gently removed from the group.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>See you soon!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/highres_447147678.jpeg","photo_id":447147678,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/600_447147678.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/thumb_447147678.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4590866,"name":"Louis","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/highres_254117213.jpeg","photo_id":254117213,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/member_254117213.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/thumb_254117213.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"Uplifting DOTA 2!

All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

Think of the group as a technology training class that works with virtualizaiton, servers, workstations, security, encryption, scripting, management strategies, network configuration, cloud, SaaS, IOT and on and on. But we don't stop there because we also play with Raspberry Pi's by setting up tor routers or ssh servers, Amazon Echo's and trying to configure new skills on AWS micro-service servers, and on and on. We are here to share our knowledge and experience with people who want to learn, get hands on, love technology and have a good time.

This is a meetup for those who feel that they have real singing talent and want the feedback of caring people who want to help one another. This meetup is going to be set up for a limited size group (5 people max per Meetup- want each person to really have a chance to sing and get feedback) that must be willing to commit to showing up and paying for their seat in a private karaoke room in midtown manhattan. If you do not want to pay for your spot or are just looking for a group to socialize with, there are other karaoke meetups that are much better suited for you, please check those out instead. This meetup will be dedicated to practicing, and will be a lot of fun for those who put effort into it. Please only request to join if you really want to practice singing and get feedback from your peers. This meetup is meant to be a nurturing, comfortable place for those who want to test their vocal range through their song choices, so no photos or videos will be allowed during the meetup. As mentioned, this meetup will occur in a private karaoke room; access to the room is charged per person, per hour. I will get specifics on how much each attendee will have to pay on the RSVP. The Meetup will be limited to 5 people in total (no guests allowed), so once the RSVP is open, it is first come, first served. All cancellations to an RSVP must occur 24 hours BEFORE the event because we are committing to bringing a certain number of people to in order to reserve the room. I need to be sure that everyone who RSVPs will show up to ensure we do not lose the room to a larger group (or worse, have to collectively pay for the empty seat) because we are suddenly short on people for the reservation.
