All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Deemed too small by the usual athletic standards, his father trains him hard, and Freddie brings a fight to the game that ultimately gets him noticed \u2014 by none other than legendary University of Texas coach Darrell Royal (Aaron Eckhart). Awarded a scholarship and a chance to play for the Longhorns, Freddie sets off to Austin with his loving high school sweetheart Linda (Sarah Bolger), determined to make the team. Alongside his old teammate Bobby Mitchell (Rett Terrell) and new pal James Street (Juston Street), Freddie is put through the paces of a grueling practice schedule, but the boys' camaraderie off the field translates into solid playing on it, and they rise up the depth charts, giving the Longhorns a real chance to turn the team around. But just when they\u2019re reveling in the success of the season, Freddie suffers an injury that leads to a shocking diagnosis and the biggest challenge he will ever face.

He passionately believes everyone should stop wasting time networking and shares how through his signature session, \u201cArt of the Schmooze.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Over the last decade, as Senior Manager of Events and Donor Engagement at GLAD, Robbie coordinated up to 25 fundraisers and donor cultivation events a year. These fundraisers raised nearly one million dollars annually (25% of GLAD's budget).<\/p> <p><br\/>In 2006, he founded Socializing for Justice (SoJust.org) to build a cross-cultural, cross-issue progressive community and network in Boston based on the philosophies of abundance and radical inclusion. In recognition of his social justice work, Boston City Council named his birthday \"Robbie Samuels Day\" in 2011.

How are we able to move our arms and legs, to learn and remember, to see and hear? The adult human brain contains a massive network of neurons that communicate with one another to control these tasks. Neurons talk to other neurons through synapses: \u00a0specialized sites of cell-to-cell contact. Synapses come in two flavors: excitatory, which promotes information propagation through networks, and inhibitory, which prevents it. The billions of neurons in the human brain form trillions of synapses, ensuring proper information flow in the brain.<\/p> <p>Many disorders of the nervous system \u2013 such as epilepsy and Autism \u2013 occur when neurons fail to form appropriate synaptic connections or when communication between neurons breaks down at the synapse. To understand what goes awry in these disorders, we must first understand how synapses are assembled in the typically developing nervous system. Dr. Paradis\u2019 research explores the topic of synapse development and how disruptions to this process might underlie human neurological disorders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Science by the Pint<\/b> is sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.\u00a0 In between their sleepless hours of hard work at Harvard Med School, they bring cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Burren<\/b> is located on Elm Street right in the heart of Davis Square, just a short walk from the Red Line stop.\u00a0 If you prefer to drive, there are metered spots on the street and in nearby municipal lots (see link below).\u00a0 Meters are active until 8:00 PM, and metered spots are free thereafter.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226468259\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"zjbtllytpbmb","time":1447113600000,"updated":1447125705000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Sudbury","address_1":"Message Jose for the address","name":"Jose's House","lon":-71.416176,"id":15919562,"state":"MA","lat":42.383427,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":17.7811164856,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445876039000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>2 Player Games, ANY Game (Previously X-Wing Miniatures)<\/b><\/p> <p>An opportunity to play those two player games that we do not play on a regular (mostly euro?) boardgaming night. \u00a0<\/p> <p>If we have an odd number of players, or if we just feel like it, yes, it is fine doing a 3, 4 or 5 player game as well.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Q &amp; A:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0What types of games are played?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Anything. \u00a0Bring anything that you think will gather enough interest. \u00a0Examples: Netrunner,\u00a0Marvel Dice Masters, Memoir '44, Twilight Struggle, Few Acres of Snow or even chess if that is your thing. \u00a0Put other suggestions on the event comments.<\/p> <p>Will try this format a couple of times to see how it goes.<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0Should I bring something?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0If you want, bring a game you feel comfortable teaching.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28.

By contrast, hitting a certain pace on the track requires<br\/>more mental effort.<\/p> <p>2) POSITIVE PEER PRESSURE<br\/>At a group workout, you're likely to push harder than you might on<br\/>your own. You're also less likely to give up when the going gets<br\/>tough. Other runners at the workout can spot sloppy form that might be<br\/>slowing you down.<\/p> <p>3) THE FUN FACTOR<br\/>Track may be about speed, but at most workouts organized by running<br\/>clubs, the vibe stays social and supportive. The track is a great<br\/>place to meet new running buddies\u2014the kind who help you get out the<br\/>door in epic conditions, or tough out a long run.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Area on the map marked with an X.

Since becoming knowledgeable in Costa Rican culture, activities and accommodations, many of my friends, relatives and members of meetup began asking me to put together trips for them. I have met some of my best friends from traveling with meetup.com and enjoy bringing like-minded people together and now specialize in vacation packages to Guanacaste on the Pacific Coast. Many Scituate residents go to the area of Nosara, near to where I live. I have the story behind that too!<\/p> <p>Come join us Tuesday night in Rockland to chat about the upcoming Costa Rica meetup group vacation packages or we will customize your own personal vacation if you don\u2019t feel like traveling with the group. Our packages include whatever activities you would like!

We often think of gratitude as something that we feel when someone helps us, or when things go our way. But actually, the deepest form of gratitude is a closely held perspective that this present human life\u2014with all its joys and sorrows\u2014is a gift. To say that life is a gift is to say that everything that happens to us has value. We will explore how gratitude can be consciously cultivated through a threefold process of remembering, appreciating and paying forward.

This is your chance to get together and discuss the world of Japanese media by picking a title, reading it, and debating it with others whom have done the same!<\/p> <p>Now, to reiterate a previous post, this last August was the THIRD YEAR ANNIVERSARY since these monthly meetings began. During that time period people have come and gone titles both new and old have been debated, and formats have changed dramatically. But in all that time we have always worked exclusively with Manga, or Japanese Comic Books.<\/p> <p><b>Not this time.<\/b><\/p> <p>Instead, we are going to try an experiment. While this is a Manga Club, our debates have, besides the main title, covered all sorts of Anime as well. A title in Japan can appear in multiple formats, be it Anime, Manga, video games, and so on. For you Haruhi fans who made the debate last December, you might also remember another format which led the way for that production, and would be ideal for an in depth debate, the infamous Light Novel!<br\/>Therefore, this month, we are going to try reading an illustrated light novel from the author behind Sword Art Online and Accel World! Reki Kawahara!<\/p> <p><b>The Isolator, Vol. 1<br\/>by Reki Kawahara <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Ever since a terrible childhood tragedy, Minoru Utsugi has wished for one thing: solitude. Years later, a bizarre encounter leaves a mysterious artifact in Minoru's body that grants his wish--but that's far from the end of his troubles. Others have been visited and given powers like Minoru's, but their twisted desires are not so benign. When a murderous force threatens the people Minoru holds dear, will his newfound abilities be enough to stand in its way? And can there be a future for someone who craves eternal solitude above all else? The story of the Isolator begins here! <\/i><\/p> <p>A limited number of copies are at the venue, and don\u2019t forget our special deal! On the night of the Manga Club, all participants get ten percent off all graphic novels in the store, and twenty five percent off any future Manga Club title releases in stock!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/226238538\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":6300000,"name":"Wednesday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"vlfkdlytpbpb","time":1447262100000,"updated":1447269965000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brockton","address_1":" 940 Belmont Street","name":"Brockton VA Hospital","lon":-71.05539,"id":23710940,"lat":42.064888,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.4456043243,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446317227000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There is no better way to spend Veterans Day than singing with the veterans at the Brockton VA!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please note the change in time.

What does it mean to adapt religious practices to secular contexts? Stephen Batchelor, an internationally known author and teacher, is committed to a secularized version of the Buddha\u2019s teachings. The time has come, he feels, to articulate a coherent ethical, contemplative, and philosophical vision of Buddhism for our age. \"After Buddhism,\" the culmination of four decades of study and practice in the Tibetan, Zen, and Theravada traditions, is his attempt to set the record straight about who the Buddha was and what he was trying to teach. Combining critical readings of the earliest canonical texts with narrative accounts of five members of the Buddha\u2019s inner circle, Batchelor depicts the Buddha as a pragmatic ethicist rather than a dogmatic metaphysician. He envisions Buddhism as a constantly evolving culture of awakening whose long survival is due to its capacity to reinvent itself and interact creatively with each society it encounters. This original and provocative book presents a new framework for understanding the remarkable spread of Buddhism in today\u2019s globalized world. It also reminds us of what was so startling about the Buddha\u2019s vision of human flourishing. Join Stephen Batchelor for the Cambridge, Mass. stop on the book tour for his book: After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for a Secular Age.

What does it mean to adapt religious practices to secular contexts? Stephen Batchelor, an internationally known author and teacher, is committed to a secularized version of the Buddha\u2019s teachings. The time has come, he feels, to articulate a coherent ethical, contemplative, and philosophical vision of Buddhism for our age. After Buddhism, the culmination of four decades of study and practice in the Tibetan, Zen, and Theravada traditions, is his attempt to set the record straight about who the Buddha was and what he was trying to teach. Combining critical readings of the earliest canonical texts with narrative accounts of five members of the Buddha\u2019s inner circle, Batchelor depicts the Buddha as a pragmatic ethicist rather than a dogmatic metaphysician. He envisions Buddhism as a constantly evolving culture of awakening whose long survival is due to its capacity to reinvent itself and interact creatively with each society it encounters. This original and provocative book presents a new framework for understanding the remarkable spread of Buddhism in today\u2019s globalized world. It also reminds us of what was so startling about the Buddha\u2019s vision of human flourishing.<br\/>Join Stephen Batchelor for the Cambridge, MA stop on the book tour for his recent book: After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for a Secular Age.

We love the idea of a more affordable, greener housing option. Tiny House Northeast's project manager\/lead designer, Isa Bauer C., will offer a view into the real world advantages and challenges of a tiny home. It's a lot more complicated than the TV shows make it appear! The presentation will help you learn whether this lifestyle is for you, and if it is, what ducks you need to get in order to help make your tiny house journey a success. An area will also be marked off in the size of a tiny house floor plan, so you can get a sense of the space you are working with, how to add \"components\", etc.<\/p> <p>SUGGESTED DONATION: $5 (accepted at the presentation)<\/p> <p>Food and beverage will be available for purchase throughout the evening.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<\/p> <p>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Where there is love and light, synchroncities -those 'chance' encounters that put you on your path - are bound to happen. 11:11 signifies spiritual awakening, as this number seems to be predominantly noticed by those who have begun their spiritual journeys.

We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be answering the wake-up call to the divine presence ... And trust me, if you come, you will hear it ringing ; )<\/p> <p>Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket\/blindfold) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls. The three I use to entrain the brain to meditation allow the body to enter deep relaxation so that the body, mind and spirit are capable of opening to the really deep work that needs be done!<\/p> <p>What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You<\/p> <p>won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and other otherworldly sounds are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved.\u00a0<\/p> <p>So, please, come and feel something unique.

I have moved from FL, selling my store, and shutting down life there that I had set up, to come here to care for my mom. She's 85, pretty 'with-it' and independent. But she really isn't able to do things like food shopping, or really fending for herself. So, my intention at first was to repair her house from last winter's damage, getting her the insurance money to keep and pay off credit cards left over from when my dad was with her. I have done that, but it is pretty apparent that she is still about $1700 a month short for bills, now that she doesn't have my dad's pension coming any longer.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, I have had to get a local job to make up that shortfall. The job is at night, so I can NOT continue the line dancing. I am sorry. I had high hopes and went and spent over $1000 on new equipment, because I was pretty serious about being able to get country dancing out to new people in this area. I hope that happens for the 80+ people that joined Redneck Country Dancers on MeetUp.com, and the number of Facebook folks that joined Country Dance Nights on Facebook.<\/p> <p><br\/>Again, I am sorry for the start &amp; stop of trying to get the line dancing going. Good luck to all of you...Mike (Mitch) Pelletier<\/p> <p>I will discontinue paying for this group this month.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion.

The brutal journey across the ocean on a vessel never intended to carry passengers had left many sick, hungry and dying. And though the sight of land brought great relief, little did they know their journey had only just begun. National Geographic Channel\u2019s two night movie event Saints &amp; Strangers, premiering Nov 22-23 at 9\/8c, goes deep inside the familiar historical account of Thanksgiving, revealing the trials and tribulations of the first settlers at Plymouth, and their complex relationship with the Native Americans. Starring Ray Stevenson, Vincent Kartheiser, Br\u00edan F. O\u2019Byrne, Barry Sloane, Anna Camp, Raoul Trujillo, Michael Jibson, Kalani Queypo, Tatanka Means, with Natascha McElhone, and Ron Livingston, Saints &amp; Strangers shines a light on the desperate and often reckless decisions that went into the founding of our country and the reverberations of those actions for centuries to come.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/vyvPkaAPurQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/vyvPkaAPurQ<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/226646619\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":" SAINTS & STRANGERS v   11-12  Thur.

Unfortunately, his new colleague Judith (Marceau) happens to be a nymphomaniac with a taste for sleeping with her coworkers--and she's determined to have him next. Between their instant attraction and Judith's unrelenting (and decidedly unsubtle) attempts to seduce him, Lambert struggles to keep his promises to himself and to get what he ultimately wants from Judith: a relationship.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-m27BchNk1o\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Directions and Parking Information<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0<b>Getting here via public transportation (MBTA)Green\u00a0Line<\/b><\/p> <p>Get off at Arlington station.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

His desire to create the Occult of Personality podcast in 2006 began with a life-long compulsion to learn more about ancient civilizations, world religions, symbolism, and the underlying hidden wisdom which they contain, but only convey to those with eyes to see and ears to hear. With well over 150 episodes completed and tens of thousands of listeners every month, the podcast continues to grow in popularity and prestige. You can find Occult of Personality podcast at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/occultofpersonality.net\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/occultofpersonality.net\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/occultofpersonality.net\/<\/a><\/a>.<\/p> <p>As part of the journey in learning about the occult and esoteric while doing the podcast, Greg became an initiate in several traditions including Illuminism and Freemasonry. In 2007, he was consecrated as a Bishop in the Gnostic and Apostolic lines of succession by T Allen Greenfield on Mt. Arabia. Additionally, Greg is a scholar of the Western esoteric tradition currently pursuing a graduate degree in Medieval Studies, focusing on Cabala.<\/p> <p>Greg has been practicing meditation regularly for more than 15 years and spiritual alchemy for more than 9 of those. He has led classes, workshops, and individual teachings on the subject since 2010.<\/p> <p>Additionally, his understanding and experience continues to evolve to better aid those who wish to learn\u00a0this method of spiritual practice.<\/p> <p>Friday, November 13, 6:30 \u2013 8:30 pm<\/p> <p>$25<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-healers-network\/events\/226079170\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Intro to Spiritual Alchemy: Using Meditation to Transform Consciousness","id":"226079170","time":1447457400000,"updated":1447465890000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1180109374000,"name":"The Boston Healers Network","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":511093,"urlname":"boston-healers-network","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Allston","address_1":"186 Harvard Ave","name":"Thunderbar Comedy\/Basement of Wonderbar","lon":-71.131065,"id":24181532,"state":"MA","lat":42.350967,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.18641495705,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447259855000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Thunderbar Comedy Presents our first Showcase!

It first began in the mid 1970's and has become a huge part of hip hop, as well as other genre's of music. The turntable was not invented as an instrument, people made it into one. Instructor Schuyler Stevens will teach students fundamental scratch techniques to build a foundation for improvising, creating, and performing a scratch routine. These scratch techniques include:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Open fader: Baby scratch, drag, scribble<br\/>Closed fader: Stab, chirp<\/p> <p>Schuyler Stevens started out in Burlington Vermont learning how to DJ and make music when he was 15. He got his own pair of turntables and inherited a small portion of his parents record collection and was off at light speed, challenging himself and pushing his own limits ever since. Schuyler moved to Boston and attended The New England Institute of Art when he was 18 to continue his pursuit for more knowledge. Since going to school, Stevens has been gigging as a DJ\/turntablist in the local Boston scene as well as in Brooklyn, NY. He has also been tracking and producing songs for multiple MC's around Boston. His music draws inspiration from old records, and mixes sounds of vintage samples with modern day synthesis, recording, and processing techniques. Schuyler believes that you can never stop learning, there will always be somebody who can show you something you never thought was possible, and in turn inspire you to push your own boundaries beyond what you imagined you could do. It is an ongoing loop perpetuated by people of like minds all striving for the same musical bliss, but in their own unique ways. In the world of music, anything and everything is possible.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mmmmaven\/events\/226567644\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Fundamental Scratch Techniques [11\/13] #FREE","id":"226567644","time":1447459200000,"updated":1447467604000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420320712000,"name":"Mmmmaven","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18296076,"urlname":"mmmmaven","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Mmmmaniacs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02215","country":"us","city":"Boston","phone":"888 693-2583","address_1":"15 Landsdowne Street","name":"House Of Blues","lon":-71.09572,"id":881127,"state":"MA","lat":42.347389,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.57939267159,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441902941000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is an 18+ event!

Admission to this event is $12.**<br\/>Guy Maddin's surreal Canadian vision is truly singular in a crowded avant-garde field. The Film Archive claims he will be there in person for his showing of My Winnipeg. I'll let the HFA describe the film, as I haven't seen it and I wouldn't even venture to describe the films of his that I have seen:<\/p> <p><br\/>Found footage, Super 8 and shoddy digital video collide in My Winnipeg, a film made for Canada's Documentary Channel that has little-to-no interest in a straightforward presentation of factual information. Narrated like esoteric beat poetry throughout by Maddin himself, the film creates a potent dream space that reflects on his upbringing in Manitoba's cold, dreary capital through a funhouse collage of styles recycled from the kind of late-night television Maddin ingested as a child while staving off subzero temperatures.

Longtime Maddin regular Louis Negin materializes onscreen to hold a sermon on bathing rituals, the bubbles in the tub segue into deep ocean waters, and a nervous crew of underwater explorers idles under tons of marine pressure until suddenly a bearded jungle man emerges from a vent to divulge his story of indoctrination into a wolf-human clan\u2014and that is only the first fifteen minutes of the movie.\u00a0The Forbidden Room\u00a0continues down a radioactive live wire of narrative convolution, rarely surfacing for air from its starting point, a perverse game of exquisite corpse that alternately evokes frantic channel hopping and the subterranean logic of the human subconscious. Transitions grow more and more deranged (at one point, we enter the daydream of a slain man\u2019s moustache), protagonists swap out every few minutes, and the same actors reappear in as many as five ludicrous iterations. Most remarkably, Maddin and Johnson have cooked up a truly one-of-a-kind hybrid of high-definition digital and organic analog filmmaking, an aggressive fusion that makes their epileptic montage appear as though the surface of a boiling broth.<\/p> <p>Preceded by<\/p> <p><b>Elms<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Directed by Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson<br\/>Canada 2014, digital video, color, 3 min<\/i><\/p> <p>Guy Maddin, along with collaborator Evan Johnson, repurposes found footage to explore different themes related to Winnipeg, which in this eerie segment centers on the dying elm tree as symbol for both the rise and fall of the city.<\/p> <p><b>Louis Riel for Dinner<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Directed by Drew Christie.

When we suffer from pain or frustration with our performance, we need to change the brain\u2019s habitual patterns that activate and organize the muscles. Dr. Feldenkrais developed a method to do just that. It replaces habits that limit our physical, mental, emotional and professional life with new, more beneficial ones that will become as natural to us as the ones we gave up. We can all find ways to feel pleasure, power and vitality in our actions, as we did in the early stages of life.<\/p> <p><b>What is the Feldenkrais Method\u00ae? <\/b>\u00a0The Feldenkrais method has given people the means to make the activities of daily life more pleasurable and pain free and to expand the range and quality of movement regardless of age or physical condition. It helps people with chronic pain, movement disorders and neurological issues. It is also a well known tool for performers - musicians, dancers and athletes to improve their performance.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>How is it done?<\/b>\u00a0The movement lessons, called \u201cAwareness Through Movement\u00ae\u201d are done lying on the floor, sitting or standing. They are easy and gentle and are designed to alert you to previously overlooked details of your movements. They train you to sense trouble before it becomes a crisis and gives you the tools to reverse the damaging process. The private lessons, called \u201cFunctional Integration\u00ae\u201d, are hands on treatments. They are used when the person needs individual attention to overcome the problems.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What you can expect from the Feldenkrais Method:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Reduced pain<\/p> <p>\u2022 New ways of coping with stress<\/p> <p>\u2022 Increased range of movement<\/p> <p>\u2022 Enhanced athletic and artistic performance<\/p> <p>\u2022 Prevention of performance related injuries<\/p> <p>\u2022 Greater ease and pleasure in physical activities<\/p> <p>\u2022 Quicker recovery of abilities following trauma<\/p> <p>\u2022 Increased mental clarity<\/p> <p>\u2022 A sense of vitality and power<\/p> <p><br\/><b>COST: <\/b>\u00a0Early bird $90 by Nov 1.\u00a0$110 after.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Sign up with a friend and save more $75\/each by Nov 1.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTER HERE:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiffanysankary.com\/Ease_Power_and_Vitality.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tiffanysankary.com\/Ease_Power_and_Vitality.html<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/1\/4\/600_442533044.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Aliza Stewart<\/b>\u00a0has been practicing the Feldenkrais Method since 1986.

Among Feldenkrais practitioners, Aliza Stewart is recognized as a master and it is no wonder.

The schedule will follow in order:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Safety, Landings and Balance<\/p> <p>Class 1 will be focusing on how to land, move and stay safe practicing Parkour outdoor and in the real world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Vaulting<\/p> <p>Class 2 will focus on the foundation of Parkour - getting over low-level obstacles fast and efficiently through the use of vaulting.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Precisions<\/p> <p>Class 3 will focus on accuracy of jumping and foot\/eye coordination honing basic standing and running jumps.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Wall Techniques\u00a0<\/p> <p>Class 4 will focus on conquering obstacles too large or tall to vault, in tandem with using walls as a means to keep a more efficient run.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Tumbling\/Acro<\/p> <p>Class 5 focus is on tumbling and\u00a0acrobatic\u00a0skills, in pursuit of fully understanding movement in a 3D space and total\u00a0proprioception.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Flow + Speed<\/p> <p>Class 6 links together all the previous lessons into one cohesive movement, and a timed obstacle course setting.<\/p> <p>------<\/p> <p>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Anything else?<\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewEnglandParkour\/events\/226743751\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":3600000,"name":"[Boston] Parkour 101 - Introduction to Parkour \/\/","id":"cllfmlytpbtb","time":1447603200000,"updated":1447608613000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284132267000,"name":"New England Parkour and Free Running Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1704666,"urlname":"NewEnglandParkour","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Traceurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Burlington","address_1":"123 Muller Road","name":"New England Movement Arts (NEMA)","lon":-71.206215,"id":22963062,"state":"MA","lat":42.468369,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":5,"distance":10.2359142303,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415293212000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n11:00 \u2013 11:15 Warm-ups<\/p> <p>\n\n11:15 \u2013 1:00PM\u00a0 Open Sparring<\/p> <p>\n\nOpen floor space will be available for sparring, etc. 11:00 to 1:00 PM<\/p> <p>\n\n\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nOur weekly Sunday classes (11a-1p in Burlington, MA).

Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb! \u00a0If you are looking for a partner, or just want to get your climb on, join us for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to toprope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. This meetup assures you'll meet a partner to climb with.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $25 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226636713\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Brooklyn Boulders Somerville Sunday","id":"rtlbklytpbtb","time":1447606800000,"updated":1447618467000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Porter Square","name":"Porter Square","lon":-71.082649,"id":24184301,"state":"MA","lat":42.393448,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.40438699722,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446409683000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will discuss socionics.<\/p> <p>Last month we were going to do an in-depth participant interview from a volunteer.

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again.

The stimulus can be anything, such as a picture, a short story, a breaking news, etc. Each meeting includes stimulus introduction, small group and whole group discussion, and personal reflection. Every attendee is encouraged (actually required) to raise questions inspired by the stimulus. And then we will discuss why these questions are important; how these questions relate to one's personal life experience; what is one's perspectives on these questions, and how the discussion might affect one's future thinking.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a place to share our souls and learn from others, NOT a place to promote any particular school of thoughts, beliefs, faiths, political views, etc. We must keep an open mind, respect each other, and agree to disagree.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Recap of last meetup:<\/p> <p>Eight members attended the last meetup. We had a group with a very diverse mix of age, gender, ethnicity, educational and professional background. This is a great advantage for a conversational meetup like Soulful Cafe, because we can learn so much more from other people with very different perspectives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Three stimuli were provided to this meetup:\u00a0<\/p> <p>1. The portrait of a 15-year-old Afghan refugee, a girl who recently fled her country hoping to reach Sweden one day. Her only possession was a purse holding all the documents that her smugglers needed to cross borders.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. The story of a ninety-year-old woman from N.J. who has been motorcycling for 74 years. She plans to cross the country on a motorcycle at 100.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3. The story of a 42-year-old guy, a chef from Cambridge who recently started riding motorcycle to free his soul. His wife didn\u2019t have any objection; she said, \u201cwhatever makes him happy.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Here are some of the questions that the group had raised and discussed based on the stimuli:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>1. What makes you passionate: motorcycle? beauty? sex?<\/p> <p>2. What is essential to life?\u00a0<\/p> <p>3. What are you fear of making the changes you want in your life?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. What is immigrant? What is country?<\/p> <p>5. What component is missing in your life that prevents you from moving forward to live a fuller life? (This was the group\u2019s favorite question for the night.)<\/p> <p>6. How much impulse control do we need? What is the cost of having too much impulse control? Can you bear the consequences of lack of impulse control?<\/p> <p>7. What is the secret of happiness?\u00a0<\/p> <p>8. What would you regret on your deathbed? (I don\u2019t want to be on my deathbed. Period. Someone said)<\/p> <p>9. Millennials are so busy connecting with others in the virtual world. Are they really connected? What is a real world?\u00a0<\/p> <p>10. How to build deep and lasting friendships?\u00a0<\/p> <p>11. What is identity? Does memory define our self identity?\u00a0<\/p> <p>12. How should Europe integrate Muslim immigrants into the non-Islamic European culture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>There were no \u201ccorrect\u201d answers to these questions. What really matters is to ask, to listen, and to ponder.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I look forward to meeting more friends in our next meetup on November 15.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nMeeting Agenda: 7pm-9pm<\/p> <p>1. Get your coffee and introduce yourselves: 10-15 minutes<\/p> <p>2. Introduce the stimulus: 5 minutes<\/p> <p>3. Small team discussion: 15 minutes<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What soulful question do you want to ask?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why is this question relevant\/important to you?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Vote on the question to submit to the whole group.<\/p> <p>4. Group discussion: 45-60 minutes<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Each team submits a soulful question and explain why this question is relevant\/important.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Vote on which question to discuss within the whole group.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0In depth group discussion on the chosen question. The conversations should be related to one\u2019s personal experience.<\/p> <p>5. Individual reflection: 10 minutes<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is your takeaway from today\u2019s discussion?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How will it affect your future thinking?<\/p> <p>6.
