We have two speakers that will dive into these subjects an much more.<\/p> <p><b>Diego Concha, @dapc85<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Managing state and inter-component communication in complex front-end applications is a pain. MV* patterns leave you with state spread across your entire application and with a smorgasbord of options for component communication (callbacks, eventing, shared services, etc\u2026). Redux provides a compelling solution for both of these challenges by evolving on the ideas of Facebook's Flux architecture and adding others from the Elm language. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Redux gives you a single source of truth for your UI's state and a simple subscription mechanism for components. The entire UI is generated from this state tree and components subscribe to changes in a the slice of state that they care about regardless of what caused that slice to change. It goes a step further in simplifying the data flow mental-model by serializing\/synchronizing all state updates. This makes UI changes easy to log and apply forward and backward in time (ie time travel debugging).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Not only will we do a motivating introduction but we'll also discuss best practices when applying Redux to Angular 1.x applications.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Jeff Whelpley, @jeffwhelpley<\/b><\/p> <p>I have gone through a half dozen different iterations of Redux in my Angular 2 app, most recently settling on a variation that includes the ngrx library which has a Reactive slant on redux. I will get into the advantages and disadvantages with different types of state management approaches. I will also show some of the code that I have been working on for GetHuman.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n------------------\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>6:00pm - Doors open for everyone; pizza and beverages available<\/p> <p><br\/>7pm - Diego's talk<\/p> <p>7:45pm - Jeff's talk<\/p> <p>8:15pm to 8:30pm - Networking, clean-up, bye!<\/p> <p>------------------<\/p> <p><b>Address:\u00a0<\/b>290 Congress Street, Boston MA<\/p> <p><b>Google Maps:\u00a0<\/b><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Brightcove\/@42.3533402,-71.052391,15z\/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x832a579c43c8b7da\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Brightcove\/@42.3533402,-71.052391,15z\/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x832a579c43c8b7da\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Brightcove\/@42.3533402,-71.052391,15z\/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x832a579c43c8b7da<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Public Transit<\/b>:\u00a0South Station, head north on Atlantic Ave 1 block, right on Congress Street.<\/p> <p><b>Parking<\/b>: There is a garage at 284 Congress.

Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MTGBoston\/events\/228776609\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Wednesday Magic In Medford","id":"228776609","time":1458167400000,"updated":1458221829000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331418092000,"name":"MTG Boston","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":3454302,"urlname":"MTGBoston","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Planeswalkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":3.70568823814,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1457997852000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a dealer's choice cash game (mostly NL Hold'em, a bit of PL Omaha).

Be truthful to yourself; the simpler things that delighted you are often the happiest moments.Set aside your cultural, faith-based understandings of \"prayers\/luck\/wishes\", etc. that seek happiness; also set aside any inner voice criticisms about happiness. One of the things that may impact your use of the jar is prior understandings or inculcated messaging about what \"rules\" you need to follow to get the jar to \"work\". The thing is, there are no rules. The jar is to serve you, rather than you serving the ritual.If you want to put other things in the jar, like a lucky token, ticket stub from a trip you loved or a note from a loved one, go ahead. It's\u00a0<i>your<\/i>\u00a0jar and your fulfillment.A variation of this concept is to focus on happy moments from a certain relationship in your life, like your relationship with your mate, or your children. A couple, for example, can commit to writing down things they love about each other every day and depositing the notes into the same jar.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Write it down on a piece of paper.<\/b>\u00a0Find scraps of paper suitable for writing a small message on. You could go to the effort of making a pile of ready-made pieces of paper (this can be a good motivator to keep doing this each day) or you could simply rip a piece of paper from a napkin, junk mail, or similar, as needed.If you can't find a piece of paper, write your note on your phone. Send a text message or e-mail to yourself and remember to transcribe it later, so you can put a physical note in the jar.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Make deposits into the happiness jar daily.<\/b>\u00a0The idea is somewhat to use it daily but life can get busy and events intervene, so if you miss days, don't be fussed; just pick it up from where you left off.Set a daily reminder or alarm on your phone.Keep the jar in a safe place where it's less likely to be bumped or in the way of everyday activities but ideally, it should be in sight to remind you to use it.If the jar has a lid, keep the lid on in case it gets knocked over. This also keeps the dust out, especially important if your jar is very large and will be sitting in the same spot for months or years.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Read the messages when life gets tough.<\/b>\u00a0This is the most wonderful part of using a happiness jar. When you feel that everything is getting to you and that there isn't much happiness in your life, take out a few of the messages and read them through. These reminders of the happiness that has been in your life and will continue to be present in your life will serve as a source of morale boosting. Your past happiness will comfort you and give you hope that there is more to come. It will also remind you that happiness is found in moments along the journey and is not a single destination with any defined point or actions.Some people enjoy starting a new happiness jar every year, and reading the contents at the end of the year. Consider making a collage or scrapbook of all your notes.<\/p> <p><br\/>I will be cross posting this event with North Shore Law of Attraction, which is a mixed group.<\/p> <p>Please be respectful of event organizers, no same day cancellations, they will count as a no show.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/228502297\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Gratuity\/Happiness Jars","id":"228502297","time":1458169200000,"updated":1458181331000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"699 Assembly Row","name":"Tony C's Sports Bar and Grill-Somerville","lon":-71.079025,"id":23695855,"lat":42.393669,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.37638449669,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458057136000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join the Boston Austrian Economics Group as we embark upon Chapter 18: Action in the Passing of Time, of the Austrian classic; \"Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,\" by Ludwig von Mises.

Be truthful to yourself; the simpler things that delighted you are often the happiest moments.Set aside your cultural, faith-based understandings of \"prayers\/luck\/wishes\", etc. that seek happiness; also set aside any inner voice criticisms about happiness. One of the things that may impact your use of the jar is prior understandings or inculcated messaging about what \"rules\" you need to follow to get the jar to \"work\". The thing is, there are no rules. The jar is to serve you, rather than you serving the ritual.If you want to put other things in the jar, like a lucky token, ticket stub from a trip you loved or a note from a loved one, go ahead. It's\u00a0<i>your<\/i>\u00a0jar and your fulfillment.A variation of this concept is to focus on happy moments from a certain relationship in your life, like your relationship with your mate, or your children. A couple, for example, can commit to writing down things they love about each other every day and depositing the notes into the same jar.<\/p> <p><b>Write it down on a piece of paper.<\/b>\u00a0Find scraps of paper suitable for writing a small message on. You could go to the effort of making a pile of ready-made pieces of paper (this can be a good motivator to keep doing this each day) or you could simply rip a piece of paper from a napkin, junk mail, or similar, as needed.If you can't find a piece of paper, write your note on your phone. Send a text message or e-mail to yourself and remember to transcribe it later, so you can put a physical note in the jar.<\/p> <p><b>Make deposits into the happiness jar daily.<\/b>\u00a0The idea is somewhat to use it daily but life can get busy and events intervene, so if you miss days, don't be fussed; just pick it up from where you left off.Set a daily reminder or alarm on your phone.Keep the jar in a safe place where it's less likely to be bumped or in the way of everyday activities but ideally, it should be in sight to remind you to use it.If the jar has a lid, keep the lid on in case it gets knocked over. This also keeps the dust out, especially important if your jar is very large and will be sitting in the same spot for months or years.<\/p> <p><b>Read the messages when life gets tough.<\/b>\u00a0This is the most wonderful part of using a happiness jar. When you feel that everything is getting to you and that there isn't much happiness in your life, take out a few of the messages and read them through. These reminders of the happiness that has been in your life and will continue to be present in your life will serve as a source of morale boosting. Your past happiness will comfort you and give you hope that there is more to come. It will also remind you that happiness is found in moments along the journey and is not a single destination with any defined point or actions.Some people enjoy starting a new happiness jar every year, and reading the contents at the end of the year. Consider making a collage or scrapbook of all your notes.<\/p> <p><br\/>with Love &amp; Gratitude<\/p> <p>Ellen Sklaver, Facilitator [masked])<\/p> <p><br\/>Sue, Event Host<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are right above McGill's Convenient Store, on the 2nd Floor.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

It can be used for information technology, green technology or biotech. And it can even be used for show business. Feature film director Matthew Martino utilized the Business Model Generation canvas to pitch and raise money for his feature film project Chainsaw Maidens from Hell. Shot in the summer of 2014 it debuted this past fall and is currently making the international film market circuit represented by Hollywood sales agents. We invite you now to learn how Matthew applied Business Model Generation in the entertainment field.<\/p> <p>Matthew will show clips from the movie and talk about what went on behind the scenes. We'll do some group work using techniques of Business Model Generation - either for your own businesses, or even for your own feature movie ideas.

Building on the ease of development and deployment provided by Spring Boot and the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, the Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task projects provide a simple and powerful framework for creating microservices for stream and batch processing. They make it easy to develop data-processing Spring Boot applications that build upon the capabilities of Spring Integration and Spring Batch, respectively. At a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams and tasks are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Apache YARN, Cloud Foundry, or Apache Mesos. This session will provide an overview of these projects, including how they evolved out of Spring XD. Both streaming and batch-oriented applications will be deployed in live demos on different platforms ranging from local cluster to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the developer experience.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tech-Talk-Tuesdays-at-Pivotal-Labs-Boston\/events\/229500132\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":10800000,"name":"Microbrews and Microservices event!","id":"229500132","time":1458252000000,"updated":1458269188000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450965515000,"name":"Happenings at Pivotal Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":19236811,"urlname":"Tech-Talk-Tuesdays-at-Pivotal-Labs-Boston","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Techies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"One Memorial Drive","address_2":"Suite 100","lon":-71.082504,"phone":"857-453.6000","name":"Microsoft New England Research & Development Center (NERD)","id":1054297,"state":"MA","lat":42.360794,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.642162084579,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457553322000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join David Pileggi as he talkd about Office 365 and IT.\u00a0<\/p> <p>IT departments world wide have become to manage and maintain as the number of systems continue to increase.

Then in 2011 &amp; 2012, he worked as the Employer Account Manager for the Greater Boston Employment Collaborative. In this role, Bruce pursued business development to facilitate access to job postings and led a group of 38 Job Developers representing several Boston area human service agencies serving disabled job seekers.<br\/>In his current role with the Carroll Center, Bruce has primary responsibility for business development and project management. He coordinates the internal work flow on accessibility projects from start to finish. This begins by assisting clients to identify and articulate their accessibility needs, and moves to matching Carroll Center personnel and resources in order to best meet those client requirements. Bruce communicates with clients throughout the evaluation or testing process and facilitates interaction between the Accessibility Services team and the client. He is a proficient user of some of the Assistive Technologies which the Accessibility Services team uses to conduct testing and evaluation of websites and other online content.<br\/>In his spare time Bruce is a competitive sailor with the SailBlind program out of the Courageous Sailing Center in Charlestown. He is the Chair of the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind\u2019s Rehabilitation Advisory Council, and is also an appointed member of Needham\u2019s Commission on Disabilities.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About The Carroll Center for the Blind<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Each year The Carroll Center for the Blind helps 5,000 blind or visually impaired children, adults and senior citizens to achieve greater independence and fulfillment in their lives. The Carroll Center serves the needs of these blind and visually impaired persons by providing rehabilitation, skills training, and educational opportunities to help them achieve independence, self-sufficiency, and self-fulfillment. The Carroll Center also advocates on their behalf by educating the public regarding the potential of persons who are blind and visually impaired. We have pioneered many innovative services for the blind and visually impaired, and have developed many methods for people with no or low vision to learn the skills to be independent in their homes, in class settings, and in their work places.

Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square.

It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard.

We have these feelings just by being alive and experiencing the world. The experience you have of being conscious is similar to the feelings you have of qualia. The difference is that your feelings of qualia are associated with specific perceptions. For example, painfulness is the quale associated with pain. That is, the painfulness of pain is a special, private, existential feeling.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Michael Tye says, \u201cPhilosophers often use the term \u2018qualia\u2019 (singular \u2018quale\u2019) to refer to the introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental lives. In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny that there are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mental states have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of their bearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside and outside the head. The status of qualia is hotly debated in philosophy largely because it is central to a proper understanding of the nature of consciousness. Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-body problem.\u201d (Ref 1)<\/p> <p>Joseph Levine says, \u201cQualia are part of the phenomenon of the subjectivity of consciousness, and pose one of the most difficult problems for a materialist solution to the mind-body problem.\u201d (Ref 2)<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.<\/p> <p>1. \u201cQualia\u201d<br\/>Michael Tye, University of Texas<br\/>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/qualia\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/qualia\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. \u201cQualia\u201d<br\/>Joseph Levine, University of Massachusetts Amherst<br\/><b><i>Encyclopedia of Philosophy<\/i><\/b>, Second Edition (2005)\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/331299\/%27Qualia%27%20Encyl%20of%20Phil%20%282005%29.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/331299\/%27Qualia%27%20Encyl%20of%20Phil%20%282005%29.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>3. \u201cQualia\u201d<br\/>Amy Kind, Claremont McKenna College<br\/><b><i>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy<\/i><\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iep.utm.edu\/qualia\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.iep.utm.edu\/qualia\/<\/a><\/p> <p>4. \u201cThree Laws of Qualia\u201d<br\/>Ramachandran and Hirstein<br\/><b><i>Journal of Consciousness Studies,<\/i><\/b> 4, 1997, pp. 429\u201358<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/331299\/Three%20Laws%20of%20Qualia%20%281997%29.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/331299\/Three%20Laws%20of%20Qualia%20%281997%29.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/331299\/Three%20Laws%20of%20Qualia%20%281997%29.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0<br\/>Donations:<\/p> <p>To help support the Democracy Center, a voluntary donation, of a few dollars, will be requested at the meeting.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/philosophy-185\/events\/229055541\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"Qualia \u2013 That Special Feeling","id":"229055541","time":1458340200000,"updated":1458417162000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1159109925000,"name":"The Boston Philosophy of Mind Group","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":331299,"urlname":"philosophy-185","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Philosophers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01810","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Andover","address_1":"52 Main Street","lon":-71.139763,"phone":"(978) 503-1048","name":"Clear and Now Holistic Healing","id":11327232,"state":"MA","lat":42.655666,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":20.7775382996,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456014971000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/0\/f\/600_447046351.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\"<i>You don\u2019t have to change yourself to meet the\u00a0expectations of others.

It\u2019s also an opportunity to peacefully transform your problems, your fears, and any pain and stress in your life into something more positive.<\/p> <p>I also consider meditating one of the most direct and easiest ways to connect to your greater Spirit-Self, and to access all that it has to offer you.<\/p> <p>By participating in these transformational group guided meditations, you\u2019ll experience how simple,delightful and easy it can be.

There is a kind of efforting in many of the ways we attempt to connect with others, whether co-workers, acquaintances, lovers, or friends. Often it feels so frustrating that we just give up.

Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 9 am. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 30 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Named after the North Star that guided slaves to freedom in the U.S., Polaris systemically disrupts the human trafficking networks that rob human beings of their lives and their freedom. Our comprehensive model puts victims at the center of what we do \u2013 helping survivors restore their freedom, preventing more victims, and leveraging data and technology to pursue traffickers wherever they operate.\u00a0In addition, you have the opportunity to see\u00a0Body &amp; Sold, Deborah Fortson's award-winning documentary play, based on real-life interviews with teen victims of sex trafficking.

This event is a tie in with the regular Manga Club events! We have passed three years of Manga Club meetings, and like the last time we held this event, I think we should appreciate the anime adaptations of past titles we have read. That being said, this time is going to be a bit different. Instead of only watching titles from past Manga Club meetings, we are also going to watch titles that might be picked in the future! Thanks again Steven for letting us use your space to host!<\/p> <p>We will vote on episodes from some of the following titles based upon past or future Manga Club selections. If something is not here, it\u2019s because the anime is not officially released, it\u2019s just too over watched to justify, or we can\u2019t get our hands on it. However, just so that no one feels left out, youtube clips of media associated with all the choices or non-choices will be made available between selections.

A\u00a0Kammerspiele, or middle-class chamber drama,\u00a0Sylvester\u00a0is the simple story\u2014I think it\u2019s a comedy, but who knows?\u2014of a man beleaguered by tensions between his mother and his wife during the final hours of a single New Year\u2019s Eve. The domestic action unfolds, elegantly eschewing intertitles, with an extremely mannered expressionism that bizarrely slows itself down to near tableau-like immobility at times. The performances, often brisk, can just as often be so slow, and the actors\u2019 poses held so long, as to be exciting, electrifying even! The closer the three strange thespians come to stock-stillness, the more they somehow approach the uninhibited language of dance, and one doesn\u2019t even care if the intended result is comedy or tragedy\u2014it\u2019s somehow both in this oddball ellipses-drunk film. Director Pick is a startling revelation, a true eccentric with a singular filmic voice. This forgotten actor\/filmmaker, I aver, was as great as kino immortal F.W. Murnau, his comrade in virtuosic German camera movement, tonal innovation and untimely death\u2014they died separately but four days apart in 1931. What couldn\u2019t they have achieved if granted just another ten years each! Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer essays the husband role wearing, it seems, the body of someone else, someone that doesn\u2019t quite fit his skin or gait; he is the epitome of bodily and marital discomforts. Edith Posca, Pick\u2019s wife and frequent collaborator, plays the young frau, while Frida Richard takes on the role of the most memorable mother-in-law in film history.\u00a0Print courtesy Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.<\/p> <p>Followed at 8:30 by\u00a0<b>The Big House<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Directed by George Hill.

The great Frances Marion, longtime writer for Mary Pickford, won the first of her two best-screenplay Oscars for this wonderfully plotted crime melodrama. Coen brothers fetish-object Wallace Beery nabbed the lead role of Butch when the already-signed Lon Chaney came down with his deadly throat cancer\u2014and a loveable superstar was born! But the truly arresting performance of the movie belongs to Robert Montgomery as a cowardly young inmate who just can\u2019t cut the prison code and turns instead to snitching. Montgomery possesses such a vast vocabulary of facial expressions for dread, shame, guilt, fear, skulking, sketchiness, horror and worthless pigeonheartedness that when I first saw\u00a0The Big House\u00a0I found myself standing up and pointing with horrified self-identification at this astonishing man\u2019s mug!

We will be creating refractographs, a very unique and colorful way of creating intricate light abstracts.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Please make sure to read the entire description in a regular browser, not the mobile app, which doesn't show the images.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is for paid members only.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/c\/7\/600_445984039.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Refractorgraphs, as the name suggests, are abstract patterns created by white light breaking on a transparent surface. In some cases, the white light is also diffracted and breaks into its individual colors through the glassy object. What works really well is simply using the bottom of a wine glass, but shiny surfaces such as CDs, Mylar, glass rods and prisms will work, too. This is all about experimenting and you are guaranteed to walk away with some unique creations.<\/p> <p>This is an indoor photo shoot to combat the cold outside, no need to dress too warmly.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Here is what you need to bring:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Your camera body with a body cap. No need for a lens, you will be shooting without a lens, so there is no f-stop. Only ISO and exposure time.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 At least one flashlight (charge the battery or bring spares!). Does not have to be overly bright.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Gaffers tape, if you have it. Clips may work, too. Don't use duct tape, it leaves residues.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 At least two, better three tripods, if you have them. One with ball head holding your camera, another one holding the flashlight, but that can be any cheap kind of stand, even home-made. They can all be very small and <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1n4ISbR\">the gorilla pod, if you have one, is great to hold your flashlight. This is also a great \"tripod\" for photo shoots on observation platforms<\/a>, such as the Empire State Building (which does not allow regular tall tripods). You will need to add a ball head to this, I recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1JaMNOU\">the affordable SunwayFoto pan ball head, a good compromise between load, quality and cost<\/a>. Also great to keep a second tripod for your second camera on expensive trips.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Instead of a third tripod, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1JSHcgc\">this flexible arm (Plamp II PP-200)<\/a> is a great and affordable solution to hold the refracting object in front of the camera, this is what you need to move most often, after your camera.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Some sort of refracting object. Bring a cheap, sturdy wine glass (the stem is easier to clamp than a water glass, and the stem may act refracting, too). Prisms, specialty glass or shiny surfaces, a CD (preferably blank). Keep it small, 2-3 inches tops.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Color gels to color your refractographs. <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1JaN5oN\">This swatch book here has several hundred different gels <\/a>in it with information on the density and color and you can use these also for flash coloring or for coloring your flashlights for our light painting events.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 If you need it, a flashlight, such as those we use for astro-landscape photography. We will be operating in a dark room, but there will be some light from the pin-hole flashlights. Any bright light will ruin everyone else's shot! These two solutions are my favorites and they will last a long time and can be used on all our night photo shoots. The <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1JaNDeC\">Celestron dimmable astronomers light<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1n4KjXW\">much smaller LRI FMR Photon Freedom LED Keychain Micro-Light<\/a>, my personal favorite.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/e\/5\/600_445984069.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>What we will have onsite:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Tables all ready for to set up your own station: Tripod set to low for the camera, another tripod or stand for the flashlight and a clamp or 3rd stand for the refracting object. If you have tall tripods and a clamp, you can also set up on the floor.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Pin-hole covers for your flashlight (they will be taped to your light).<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Some tape, but it helps if you bring some, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 <i>Some<\/i> refracting objects (not enough for everyone).<\/p> <p>\u2022 <i>Some <\/i>color gels<\/p> <p>\u2022 <i>A few <\/i>additional stands, but please try to bring your own.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/61998183\">Here is an instructional video on how to do refractograms. <b>Please make sure to watch this before you come to this event!<\/b><br\/><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/petapixel.com\/2013\/04\/08\/how-to-create-and-photograph-incredible-refractographs\/\">And here is another page with information<\/a><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is the recommended setup:<\/b><\/p> <p>Tripod with camera, no lens.

There is not much to say other than he is one of artists who we respect the most in the entire game. His productions are classic and his djing is sublime. We know you will enjoy<\/p> <p>Chez Damier (Balance Alliance, Prescription Records KMS, Chicago)<\/p> <p>with support from Matt Mcneill and Chad Spigner<\/p> <p>Here is some more about Chez<\/p> <p>Already a legendary figure in electronic music, Chez Damier has played close witness to many of the pivotal moments in the history of house and techno. Jointly responsible with studio partner Ron Trent for both Prescription Records - widely recognised as one of the greatest house labels of all time - and \u2018The Morning Factory\u2019 - one of the most ethereal jams ever to rock a room - Chez Damier is a true deep house pioneer. More than that, the Chicago DJ has played pivotal roles in the development of KMS, The Music Institute and The Bellville Three, hallowed pieces of musical history that prove his contribution to dance music over the years. As an artist Chez Damier represents a unique blend; he is as impetuous and daring as now as in 1989 and being able to qualify this with his own unique heritage makes his releases and DJ performances doubly formidable. Today his sets are entirely unique, not just because of the experience and knowledge he can call upon. After something of a hiatus, a series of releases for the German label Mojuba signalled that he was on his way back to show the new artists the way and nowadays he has taken the torch of Prescription by launching Balance Alliance as a home for some of the most forward thinking and talented producers of the next generation to join him on the imprint. Studio partnerships with Parisian Ben Vedren has reignited the production flame under several alias, and so now he is back making his best work once more. A regular around the world from DC10 in Ibiza to Smart Bar Chicago and many more, Chez Damier is a modern house hero.<\/p> <p><br\/>$10 all night<br\/>party by CSC<br\/>flier by Alfredo<br\/>visuals by Jon Von Bonk<br\/>Facebook Event Page<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/805905842870069\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/805905842870069\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonEDM\/events\/228705889\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Sweet Shop with Chez Damier","id":"228705889","time":1458439200000,"updated":1458451012000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1196924921000,"name":"Boston Electronic Dance Music","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":861021,"urlname":"BostonEDM","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"EDM Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"65 Holland St, Somerville","address_2":"Davis Square","lon":-71.123955,"phone":"(617) 591-2100","name":"Orleans Bar & Grill","id":411639,"state":"MA","lat":42.398262,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.82533836365,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451336234000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/c\/e\/600_427005262.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After Dodgeball\u00a0we head to\u00a0Orleans\u00a0Restaurant\u00a0for drinks, appetizers, and karaoke.

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

Emotional Freedom Technique, also known as EFT or tapping, is\u00a0a simple technique for releasing\u00a0emotional blocks and reducing stress. Since stress is at the source of many ailments, the simple act of tapping stress away can have profound and life changing positive consequences.<\/p> <p>EFT is a powerful way to change any area of life from emotional upsets to fears to trauma to removing blocks to a life filled with joy and peace! Ultimately it helps us to be ourselves, freeing ourselves up from the limitations of our past beliefs and the hold negative past experiences have had on us. Learn how to clear past events or memories that get triggered frequently. Remove the blocks to creating more abundance and success in your life and find out how you can use EFT to heal from chronic physical and\/or emotional pain. Eliminate phobias, fears, anxiety, food cravings and feelings of sadness or depression.<\/p> <p><br\/>A tapping circle is a group in which all members tap together and in turn on the issues that ail them. This process\u00a0allows you to heal your issue whether you openly participate or prefer to remain private. Our\u00a0tapping circle welcomes tappers of all levels, including complete beginners. What better way to try EFT than in a group setting where a strong and powerful synergy takes place between all present!<\/p> <p>Please arrive early. Doors will open 15 minutes ahead of time and the tapping circle will begin promptly at 2 pm. Late comers will not be allowed in. A late arrival not only disrupts the flow of the circle, shatters the feeling of safety so necessary in healing work, but can also prevent the facilitator from pacing the circle well.<\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor more information on EFT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emofree.com\">www.emofree.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eftuniverse.com\">www.eftuniverse.com<\/a><\/p> <p>For more information on the organizer and facilitator of the Boston Tapping Circles: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.luciemonroe.com\">www.luciemonroe.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Feel free to email Lucie, the organizer, if you have questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-healers-network\/events\/229057429\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"EFT Tapping Circle","id":"xwhtqlyvfbbc","time":1458496800000,"updated":1458506219000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1180109374000,"name":"The Boston Healers Network","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":511093,"urlname":"boston-healers-network","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":12,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456188084000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>\u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion.

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large. Oh and add to that I spend 30+ hours every week of my own time running the group which I get paid $0 for.<\/p> <p>Please help keep the group going. Don\u2019t let not giving $11 a year, every year stop all the fun. Oh and you don\u2019t have to pay the $11 online you can pay the $10 in person or e-mail me to pay by check.<\/p> <p>If you want to pay online Meetup has shut down the Amazon payment feature so you can now pay using Paypal and pay $11 to my PayPal account using e-mail address which is <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"mailto:[masked]\"&gt;===================================<\/a><\/p> <p>With PayPal, you can send money to anyone with an email address.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how to send money:<\/p> <p>Log in to your PayPal account.<\/p> <p><br\/>Click Send money to a friend at the top of the page.<\/p> <p>Type the email address or mobile number to whom you are sending money, and the\u00a0amount being sent.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, \u00fcber-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band\u2019s music videos. There\u2019s only one problem: he\u2019s not part of a band\u2026yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he\u2019s promised - calling himself \u201cCosmo\u201d and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos. Inspired by writer\/director John Carney\u2019s (ONCE, BEGIN AGAIN) life and love for music, SING STREET shows us a world where music has the power to take us away from the turmoil of everyday life and transform us into something greater.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/C_YqJ_aimkM\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/C_YqJ_aimkM<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/229590360\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sing Street  3-21  Mon.

This is a rare opportunity to hear from a family of educators who have touched the lives of thousands of students, and a can\u2019t-miss conversation for anyone interested in teaching, higher education, or education leadership, as well as for students who are considering their own careers in education.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/b\/a\/600_447655482.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Contact: Roger Falcon - <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> -[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast\/events\/229447625\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Drew Faust+ on Education","id":"229447625","time":1458595800000,"updated":1458607487000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164140077000,"name":"The Cambridge Moveable Feast","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":370532,"urlname":"Cambridge-Moveable-Feast","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Citizens of the World"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"1 Silber Way, 9th floor","name":"Boston University Trustees Ballroom","lon":-71.099953,"id":12138352,"state":"MA","lat":42.349705,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.69037795067,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455925691000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Happy Nowruz (Persian New Year) to celebrate the festival of spring!<\/p> <p>ACANSRS Annual Silk Road Lecture 2016 at Boston University<\/p> <p>Dr. Michael Barry (Princeton University) gives a lecture and slide show on the 15th- and 16th-century Persian miniatures in the beautiful hall at BU with a nice city view. \u00a0Light refreshments with tea\/coffee after the talk.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/1\/600_447011489.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Alexander the Great, setting out to conquer the Persian Empire in 334 BC, lamented over Achilles\u2019 tomb at Troy that he enjoyed no Homer to sing his exploits.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/229273741\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvfbcc","time":1458601200000,"updated":1458754254000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02141","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","lon":-71.090599,"id":4364672,"state":"MA","lat":42.366314,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.14090037346,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440100036000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We hope to make these socials a place where you can informally bring your big-thinking ideas, dreams, knowledge, LACK of knowledge(!), and enjoy the company of like-minded individuals interested in a tiny life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring your home designs or crazy ideas to share, or just listen to others passionate about tiny houses and the tiny house lifestyle.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be standing in the bar area, so we can all mingle and meet more easily.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you soon!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dana, David and Chris<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Standing at the bar area.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GreaterBostonTinyHouseEnthusiasts\/events\/228514536\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":10800000,"name":"Cambridge Monthly Social","id":"zdvcklyvfbcc","time":1458601200000,"updated":1458612888000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1373330896000,"name":"Greater Boston Tiny House Enthusiasts","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":9274172,"urlname":"GreaterBostonTinyHouseEnthusiasts","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Tiny House Pilgrims"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02145","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"6 Vernon St.","name":"Vernon Street Studios","lon":-71.1017,"id":1529380,"state":"MA","lat":42.391178,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.69976139069,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454960111000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come draw some dynamic poses with us at Damon's studio- we do shorter poses here, 5 minutes to start, and ranging through 10, 20, and 30 minute poses.\u00a0 Informal setting in Damon's painting studio, surrounded by his paintings and work in progress.<\/p> <p>You can pay online in advance when you RSVP, and save time for drawing during the session. \u00a0Please customize the amount you're paying online according to whether you've paid your membership this month or not ($10 for members, $25 for a one-time drop in- which can be converted to a membership should you come back that same month).\u00a0You may also pay your $25 monthly membership when that comes due each month online either together with the payment for the drawing session or separately through the link to the left on the sidebar.<\/p> <p>Parking is on-street legally for two hours for people without Somerville parking permits, BUT WE PREFER THAT YOU PARK IN THE LOT AROUND BACK, WHICH IS OPEN till about 11PM. \u00a0The building is a working factory, so the lot is monitored and safe, though it is a bit of a walk around the building to the front door. \u00a0 Please do not leave your car in the lot past 11pm or so, or on Saturdays past three pm, as they lock the gate if there is not late shift and your car will be locked in until the next shift starts at the factory.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"corner of Central Street and Vernon Street, big brick building.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/229504836\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvfbcc","time":1458603000000,"updated":1458650952000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"646 Brookline Ave","name":"Boston Shambhala Center","lon":-71.113411,"id":23059562,"lat":42.332909,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.90739893913,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454275840000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A weekly gathering bringing together Buddhist meditation practice and recovery.

But with the operating system of just one company, Microsoft, running more than 95% of the world's desktops and servers, there was \"one neck to choke,\" so to speak.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The advent of Internet connected machinery, medical devices, industrial control systems, vehicles and cities changes all that. Suddenly there are millions, hundreds of millions and billions of connected endpoints running an endless variety of firmware - itself a composite of proprietary and open source components.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Sure, that software was always out there - it just didn't have an IP address. Now it does.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What's to be done? And by that we mean: how do we identify and map our organization's software supply chain? Once that monumental task is complete, how do we assess the security of that software? Once we identify the security risks, what tools do we have to address those risks?\u00a0<\/p> <p>These are the question that will animate this month's Security of Things MeetUp. We've got a great panel of local security experts who are deep in the software supply chain problem.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28.

We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/229518634\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"The Tuesday Track Workout","id":"bdcdmlyvfbdc","time":1458685800000,"updated":1458698475000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":3.76958274841,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454070898000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a meeting for you if you have a <b>project idea<\/b>, <b>class idea<\/b>, <b>event idea<\/b>, or <b>looking for a project to participate<\/b>.<\/p> <p>You are also welcome if you just want to see a place and chat.<\/p> <p>The BosLab active members will help you to plan the next step for your project.

Our previous events this year have been such a success, we are doing it again, and this time we have feed back on age preferences, so here we go...<\/p> <p>Tired of online conversations that go nowhere? Profile pics from ten years ago? Does your thumb hurt from swiping? Can't understand why other speed dating events cost almost $40?<\/p> <p>Want to just meet someone in person and have a real conversation??<\/p> <p>Join us at Speed Dating for Professionals, brought to you by the crew at BostonYPA.com. The structure is simple:<\/p> <p>1.) Arrive and relax during a mini happy hour - say hello, grab a drink.<\/p> <p>2.) Enjoy several five minute dates with new faces. We will give you a question at each round to help get the conversation (and the laughter!) going. After five dates or so we will give you a quick break to get a refill, run to the loo, or even continue a conversation with the handsome stranger that was just sitting across from you.<\/p> <p>3.) No need to swipe right or left - after your date is over, check off if you'd like to speak with them again. Within 24 hours (probably the same night since we will be so excited to send these out!) we will email participants the email address of matches. 4.) No matches? No problem. We will invite you back to our next speed dating event for free. Tickets: Ladies please buy a Ladies ticket, Gentleman please buy a Gentleman ticket. This allows us to get an even number of participants. Due to space and logistics, tickets for this event are limited to 30 Ladies and 30 Men. To help keep the numbers even, we will initially offer 20 of each, and once both genders hit the 20 count, increase tickets to 25, then 30. These events run best when there is balance to the room - if your ticket type is sold out, please DO NOT BUY THE OTHER TICKET.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

(You promise to bring a Studio Ghibli themed potluck dish to share with 3-4 people and you can help yourself to a slice or two of pizza to go with it!)<\/p> <p>Pizza Tickets - $18<\/p> <p>You're a hardcore fan, but sometimes life gets complicated and it's just not possible to cook AND get your cosplay perfect. We got you. That's why pizza was invented after all. (We'll provide the pizza, plus you'll get to sample some of the potluck dishes)<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p><br\/>If I sign up for \"x\" ticket, is that all I can eat?<\/p> <p><br\/>-Nope. ALL food will be shared by ALL people. You're not locking yourself into a dinner, just into cooking.<\/p> <p>\n\nCan I drink alcohol at the event?<\/p> <p><br\/>-Not this time. Due to venue restrictions and weird liquor laws, we're not allowed to bring or sell alcohol on the premesis. Please don't try and sneak a flask or you'll be kindly asked to leave without a refund. We're working on making this a reality in the future though, so stay tuned!<\/p> <p>\n\nIs Cosplay allowed?<\/p> <p><br\/>-ABSOLUTELY! Not just allowed, but highly encouraged! We're even going to have a contest for the best theme cosplay, so break out the glue gun and get crafting!<\/p> <p>\n\nCan I bring my cosplay props?<\/p> <p><br\/>-Absolutely! If there aren't at least two Kiki's running around on brooms, we'll be sad. Unfortunately, due to venue restrictions, we can't allow live steel or projectile weapons, so leave those NERF guns and katanas at home.<\/p> <p>\n\nDo I need to know how to Waltz or Cha-Cha for the dance?<\/p> <p><br\/>-Nope! No formal dance this time. A long running staple of anime cons the world over, Happy Hardcore is *the* hard hitting beat to lift your spirits and get your feet moving and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/djnickcastle\/\">DJ Nick Castle<\/a><\/p> <p>spins until the very end.<\/p> <p>\n\nBut I wanted to see \"insert other Studio Ghibli movie here!\"<\/p> <p><br\/>-While we're working on breaking into the Minstry to get a Time Turner, we've had no luck just yet and are unfortunately bound by the normal conventions of time and space. That means we have to pick and choose the films that will fit neatly into our time slots. Don't worry though, this won't be the last event we throw.Recent Posts<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup\/events\/229728189\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":28800000,"name":"SOLD OUT STUDIO GHIBLI THEMED DINNER & DANCE","id":"229728189","time":1458759600000,"updated":1458790119000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1223061966000,"name":"The Boston Japanese Anime & Films Social Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1294353,"urlname":"BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":175,"distance":1.72169387341,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433641701000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you VEGETABLE-TARIANS want all the OTHER people\u00a0(even if they have not committed to be vegetarians) to eat fresh produce?\u00a0 Then help us - each Wednesday late afternoon - bag vegetables (and some fruit) for the neighbors in Mission Hill.\u00a0 Usually there are also freshly-baked loaves of bread, also (baked that morning - Jessica's Bakery).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/9\/4\/600_442755508.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>It's an assembly line, then take home a bag (or two) of produce for yourself.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring your business cards, smartphone, or notepad, and prepare to exchange contact info with other volunteers you like.\u00a0 Volunteers come from several sources (not merely this meetup or others:Craigslist, Pharmacy School, School of Public Health, etc.)\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/8\/9\/600_442755497.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br\/>VOLUNTEERING for $2\/bag of produce in Mission Hill<br\/>Tobin Community Center, 1481 Tremont Street<br\/>Mission Hill, Roxbury<br\/>(between Brigham Circle and Roxbury Crossing T stops)<br\/>Boston, MA 02120 - &lt;2 blocks from Orange Line T Each Wednesday, from 4:00 - 6:00 pm (indoors in bad weather)<\/p> <p>We will be VOLUNTEERING for the weekly Wednesday late afternoon $2\/bag of produce in Mission Hill.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/9\/f\/600_442755519.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhen you volunteer, <b><br\/>YOU will ALSO TAKE HOME one or two of those \"$2 bags\"!<\/b><i><br\/>We've had 55 volunteers, and we've had 7.\u00a0 Workloads vary!<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/2\/9\/600_431863817.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Fair Foods provides a 20-22 bag of produce for the Mission Hill neighbors so they can eat like me - on produce.

If you struggle with staying on beat\/rhythm,you know very little about combination, musicality, or this is a new experience for you I will highly suggest level 1. Level 2 you will learn more difficult turn patterns and footwork but if you are not ready for level 2 you will be kindly asked to drop down to level 1. Dancing Salsa is a very fun yet dangerous dance. Safety is number 1 and we want to make sure everybody is executing proper techniques so that every dance\/song you take part of you are dancing as smoothly and safe as possible.<\/p> <p>All payments will be made upon your arrival at the first class.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

While he started on cello in third grade, he was drawn to the mandolin after getting bored learning ukulele. Soon after, Ethan was traveling around the country going to mandolin and music instructional events such as the Mandolin Symposium, the Swannanoa Gathering and the Berklee 5-Week Summer Performance Program. Though Ethan is currently attending Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA, he took lessons from jazz mandolinist Don Stiernberg through high school.

The Appalachian music surrounding Julian\u2019s home in Asheville NC has been central to his musical upbringing. In addition to gigging and playing in various bluegrass and folk bands, the most developmental experiences have been the countless hours of jamming and learning from fellow musicians. Julian is currently a 3rd semester student at Berklee College of Music where he studies jazz violin among other styles and skillsets. Julian\u2019s passion for music is rooted in its emotional impact, and the power it has to transcend reality and unify people.
