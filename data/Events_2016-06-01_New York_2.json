For those hardy souls who finish all three, there will be a special reward.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Meet time: Sunrise 5:45 A.M. at 179th Street and Fort Washington Ave.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0On the day of the Kentucky Derby- the fastest two minutes in sports- we will do the fastest 50 miles in HVH for 2016. <b>Thoroughbreds only<\/b>. This trek will start on the Manhattan side of the George Washington Bridge and head up the Hudson River Greenway to the northern tip of the island before heading over the Henry Hudson Bridge into The Bronx. We will carry on through some beautiful sections of Fieldston and Riverdale before heading over to Broadway and making our way into Yonkers in southern Westchester County.\u00a0<\/p> <p>At that point, we will connect with the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail and head up to its northern terminus at the New Croton Dam in Northern Westchester. Fromm that point we will find our way further up Northern Westchester until we reach our ultimate destination, the east side of the Bear Mountain Bridge.I will fill in specific details of the last portion of the route as we get closer to the date but I anticipate it covering between 48-50 miles and lasting about 15 hours-16 hours which will take us to about 9 or 10 o'clock. Sunset is scheduled for ~7:45 P.M. so the last miles will be in the dark.There will be numerous bailouts along the way as the route tracks Metro North once we reach Westchester County. Come with your legs, heart, and mental commitment you will be rewarded with a very fulfilling experience and the energy from the group will enable you to cover distances you didn't think were possible.look forward to seeing you all.<b> CARPE DIEM!!!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FROM HERE:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/a\/600_447000490.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>TO HERE:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/d\/600_447000493.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/img1.meetupstatic.com\/img\/smileys\/laughing.gif\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Stephen Miller","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hvhikers\/events\/228971746\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"2016 URBAN HIKING SERIES Triple Crown Part 3- GW Bridge to BEAR MOUNTAIN BRIDGE","id":"228971746","time":1462614300000,"updated":1462627086000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1229395389000,"name":"Hudson Valley Hikers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1338658,"urlname":"hvhikers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"HV Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Union","address_1":"899 Magie Avenue","name":"Elmora Hills Nutriton","lon":-74.241417,"id":17735602,"state":"NJ","lat":40.672642,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.2400665283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462317994000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We advance together to our individual goal of getting in the best shape of our life, getting healthier with nutrition which is 80% and working out is only 20% of the plan.

The pace is steady, but not fast. Most of the route is fairly flat. We keep to the waterside as much as possible. We\u2019ll go rain or shine and many of us will make it round, regardless of the weather. We walk through more than twenty parks and promenades and touch dozens of communities and cultures.

The presence he channels is clearly other, but the listener detects a profound understanding of human nature, a delightful sense of humor, and a very wise and honest perspective on the flawed world we have created.\u201d<br\/>\u2013 Ellen Heath<\/p> <p>\u201cAs <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i> student for many years, I had always wondered what it would have been like to bear witness to Helen Shucman\u2019s channeling of that masterpiece, in the late 1960\u2019s. Forty years later, we can do just that. Even more miraculous, we are now called to bear witness to the Divine within. We are called, like Paul, to do the work of Awakening. It is time to join millions around the world who are rising, ever rising in frequency, despite the headlines. It is time to get off the spiritual buffet line and put the books down for a bit. It is time to experience being IN Love. It is work, this workshop. And it is glorious.\u201d<br\/>\u2013 John Crotty\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>ABOUT PAUL SELIG<\/b><\/p> <p>Paul Selig is a writer, empath and conscious channel. He received his Master\u2019s Degree from Yale and served on the faculty of NYU for over 25 years. A spiritual experience in 1987 left him clairvoyant. His breakthrough works of channeled literature, <i>I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation, The Book of Knowing and Worth <\/i>and <i>The Book of Mastery<\/i> have quickly become the most important and celebrated expression of channeling since <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i> rose to prominence in the 1970s.

It is appropriate for those who are new to riding on the roads and those who have been riding their bike a long time--anyone who wants to feel more confident about riding safely on the roads. We will discuss riding safely in traffic, including choosing the correct lane, scanning for nearby cars, signaling, changing lanes, navigating traffic lights, and turning against traffic. We will also reinforce your confidence to choose an appropriate bike and visible clothing, navigate road hazards and changing weather, ride in a group, and make emergency maneuvers when needed. The class includes classroom and on-road components. You must attend both days (Saturday and Sunday). Please don't reserve a spot unless you are sure that you can attend both sessions. Plan to bring your bike and helmet for on-road riding and parking lot drills. Plan to bring lunch on Saturday.

But unlike \"regular\" college, at One Day University there are no grades. No tests. No homework.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Here's the list of this day's lectures:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>FULL SCHEDULE: \u00a0May\u00a07th,\u00a0New York City \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>9:30 AM - 10:40 AM<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Reinventing English: The Future of Reading, Writing and Thinking<\/b><\/p> <p>Seth Lerer \u00a0\/\u00a0 University of California at San Diego\u00a0<\/p> <p>Should English be an official language; what standards\u00a0do we use in public discourse; what happens when cultures come together and introduce new words; what role does technology have in language change? These are all questions that have been asked for a thousand years, when the Anglo-Saxons first committed \"English\" into writing and created poetry and prose of\u00a0power and imagination.<br\/>English has always been \"re-invented\" by everyone who speaks and writes it. In this course, we will search for ways of anticipating future changes to the language and prepare for a world in which English will be re-invented before our eyes and ears.<\/p> <p><i>10:55 AM - 12:05 PM<\/i><\/p> <p><b>America's Founders: What Were They Really Like?<\/b><\/p> <p>Joanne Freeman\/\u00a0 Yale University<\/p> <p>America's founders\u00a0were ambitious. They were grouchy (especially John Adams). They were scared. They were hopeful. They told jokes (sometimes dirty ones.) They fought. They schemed. They gossiped. \u00a0They occasionally killed each other (sorry, Alexander Hamilton.) They sometimes made great big crashing mistakes. And above all, they were human.\u00a0 Responding to an awestruck letter written to him in his old age, John\u00a0Adams replied: \"Let me\u00a0tell you a very great secret, as far as I am capable of comparing the merit of different periods, I have no reason to believe we were better than you.\"<br\/>Only by seeing the Founders as human can we appreciate the full story of the nation's founding with all of its drama, humor, and significance intact. This talk will explore what it felt like to be one of the nation's founders, standing on the national stage, bringing an experimental government to life, and wondering what would happen next.<\/p> <p>\n\n<i>12:05 PM - 1:25 PM<\/i><br\/>Lunch Break \u00a0 \u00a0 Students will have 1 hour and 20 minute lunch break. You may bring your own or purchase it at a nearby restaurant.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i>1:25 PM - 2:35 PM<\/i><\/p> <p><b>How Religion Changes Your Brain<\/b><\/p> <p>Andrew Newberg \u00a0\/\u00a0 Thomas Jefferson University\u00a0Medical School\u00a0In this presentation, students will learn about breakthrough discoveries in religion and\u00a0the brain. Not only do prayer and spiritual practice reduce stress and anxiety, but just 12 minutes of meditation per day may actually slow down the aging process. Contemplating a loving God rather than a punitive God reduces anxiety, depression, and stress, and increases feelings of security and\u00a0compassion.<br\/>Fundamentalism, can be personally beneficial, but the anger and prejudice generated by extreme beliefs can permanently damage your brain. Intense prayer and meditation permanently change numerous structures and functions in the brain, altering your values and the way you perceive reality. Professor Newberg will also explain the best ways to \"exercise\" your brain and guide you through specific routines derived from a wide variety of Eastern and Western spiritual practices that improve personal awareness and empathy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<i>2:50 PM - 4:00 PM<\/i><\/p> <p><b>The Politics of Islam: The Good, The Bad, The Future<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tarek Masoud \u00a0\/\u00a0 Harvard University<\/p> <p>\n\nProfessor Tarek Masoud is one of America's leading authorities on Islam, and in this presentation he will draw on a lifetime of thought and research to provide an accurate, richly nuanced, and revelatory account of the fastest growing religion in the world. We'll explore the major questions and issues that face Islam in the 21st century that will deeply affect global politics. Is Islam compatible with modern notions of democracy, rule of law, gender equality, and human rights? How representative and widespread is Islamic fundamentalism and the threat of global terrorism? Can Muslim minority communities be loyal citizens in America and Europe?<br\/>In the midst of these difficult questions\u00a0Professor Masoud will turn the mirror on the US and Europe and paint a revealing portrait of how we appear to Muslims. Recent\u00a0decades have brought extraordinary changes in the Muslim world, and in addressing these issues this class\u00a0presents \u00a0a complex picture of Islam in all its diversity-a picture of urgent importance as we face the challenges of the coming century.<\/p> <p><b>********************************************************************<\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTRATION<\/b> - The regular price for this event is <b>$179<\/b>, but there is an early-bird price available for <b>$109<\/b>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onedayu.com\/events\/detail\/311\"><b>Click here to register<\/b><\/a>\u00a0and enter <b>code NY109.<\/b>\u00a0 This is a limited time discount offer. \u00a0<b>If this code has expired, try code LEARN for a 30% discount totaling $125 or code NY129 for $129.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This event is extremely popular, so if you're interested, register as soon as you can.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b>***********************************************************************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>DINNER:<\/b>\u00a0 For those of you who may wish to have dinner following the event, I have made a reservation at <b>Pio Pio<\/b>, <b>702 Amsterdam Avenue at 94th Street (a few blocks away) at 5pm.<\/b>\u00a0 Right now that reservation is for 10 people but I may be able to up the count if there is a lot of interest.<\/p> <p>Pio Pio is a lively restaurant that offers creative cocktails and mammoth portions of ceviches and moist Peruvian chicken at a reasonable cost.

They have become the new historians \u2013\u201cpreservers of our legacy.\u201d The Brooklyn Chapter realizes that many societal misconceptions start with how we are portrayed in the media. To counteract the adverse portrayal of African Americans in the movies and media, the Brooklyn Chapter, in 2002, initiated Linkages: Women of African Descent Film Festival. By choosing and screening films that depict the positive linkages that women of African descent have to their families, neighborhoods and communities, the film festival is able to effectively influence peoples\u2019 perceptions through the medium of film.<\/p> <p>The festival will take place Saturday, May 7, 2016 at LIU Brooklyn (Corner of Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues), Media Arts Department, Spike Lee Screening Room from 10am-6pm.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blacktvandfilmcollective\/events\/230620730\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":97200000,"name":"Women of African Descent Film Festival","id":"230620730","time":1462629600000,"updated":1462728089000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435088912000,"name":"The Black TV and Film Collective","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18693982,"urlname":"blacktvandfilmcollective","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Storytellers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003 ","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"4 Union Square South","lon":-73.99073,"phone":"212-673-5388","name":"Whole Food Market Union Square 2nd Floor Cafe","id":879142,"state":"NY","lat":40.734657,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.06302416325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1349639091000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Meetup\/Hangout\u00a0\u2013 9:45 am<\/b><\/p> <p>Whole Foods (Union Square) -- upstairs cafe.

In cultivating an understanding of Generosity we see that it is deeply connected to \"letting go.\" It is the releasing of our attachment to any of the constantly changing things we mistakenly believe will last or make us feel safe and happy. Giving and receiving are two aspects of Generosity that engender a feeling of liberation from suffering. Together they reflect our own sharing as well as our personal acceptance of generosity from others in equal measure.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps--one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.<\/p> <p>RUNNING TIME:<\/p> <p>2 hours and 27 minutes<\/p> <p>GENRE<\/p> <p>Action<\/p> <p>WHERE TO EAT LUNCH or DINNER:<br\/>TBD, plans are to eat somewhere in K-Town<\/p> <p>REFERENCE:<br\/>[Link]<\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

Each month a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed and debated. This group, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Freemasons.<\/p> <p><b>Study Topic<\/b><br\/>March's topic will be conducted by Brother Lylia Gonzalez Frayle on a study of Freemasonry: \u00a0What are the Three declared objectives of the Theosophical society and how do they compare to those of Freemasonry?\u00a0After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.<\/p> <p>The object of the Theosophical society was to liberate man from bondage by presenting a philosophy of life that would show him how to find the truth within himself. The literature presented by the Theosophical Society, though a statement in modern form of the ancient wisdom, is not offered as a creed, but it is intended to provoke thought and study. It gives an explanation of the problems in life that every person can verify by himself, if he so will. Belief in, and the wish to promote, the brotherhood of mankind are the only prerequisites for good standing in the Theosophical society. So, what, indeed, is Theosophy? What is the difference between the Three Fundamental Propositions of the Secret doctrine and the The Three declared objectives of the Theosophical society? How do they compare to those of Freemasonry?<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education. We further embrace the concept of a community environment, where ideas can be shared and debated in an open forum. From the seven liberal arts to the arcane, we seek to gain and to share the knowledge that is the legacy of mankind.<\/p> <p><b>More Resources<\/b><br\/>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Facebook:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Learn more about Freemasonry: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City\/events\/227178379\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"What are the Three declared objectives of the Theosophical society?","id":"227178379","time":1462645800000,"updated":1462658083000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1378747138000,"name":"Freemasonry for Men and Women in New York City","group_lon":-73.8099975586,"id":10179932,"urlname":"Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11211","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"2 Havemeyer St","name":"Muchmore's","lon":-73.952896,"id":10496742,"state":"Ne","lat":40.716473,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":3.0294380188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1387062471000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for an afternoon of figure drawing!

It's a bit smaller too. The entrance is on 17th Street between 2nd and 1st Avenues.\"<\/p> <p><b>*************************************************************<\/b><\/p> <p>Many of you have been asking for a Manhattan MeetUp, so here's the FIRST of THREE for this month!<\/p> <p><br\/>We sent out a short, 10-question Member Survey via an email blast to all of our Members on April 13, 2016. \u00a0Based on the results of that survey we are filling the May, 2016 calendar with the \"top picks\" of favorite dog runs... not only in Manhattan, but also in Brooklyn, Queens and even New Brunswick, New Jersey!<\/p> <p>If you have not responded to that survey yet, by all means do so and let us know where your favorite dog runs are so that we may schedule future MeetUps there too! \u00a0<\/p> <p>Our primary goal for 2016 is to schedule many MeetUps during each month at locations convenient to our Members... wherever they may live. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Now a few words about the Stuyvesant Square Park Dog Run...<\/p> <p>Some of this data came from our Members and some from reviews on Yelp.com:<\/p> <p>This dog run is large and square in shape, with no separate areas for S\/M\/L dogs. \u00a0It is considered one of the best dog runs in NYC!<\/p> <p>Half of the area is under renovation at present, but it is still large enough to accommodate a comfortable dog run, based on the typical space allocated to dog runs at other NYC parks.<\/p> <p>The ground is a combination of asphalt pavement and stone pavers (no grass, but minimal or no dust!) so dogs tend to stay much cleaner here when they leave the run as opposed to other sites with huge dirt areas and fine pebble\/sand.<\/p> <p>There is ample shading offered by mature trees (see photos below) and plenty of seating benches for the humans.<\/p> <p>The main entrance is double-gated, but there are also single door \"side entrances\" that are occasionally used by patrons which may pose a problem if they are not closed properly or if a nearby dog gets too curious to see what's on the other side. \u00a0We just need to be aware of this and be very careful for our canine kids. \u00a0This is not the dog run to lose yourself in a newspaper while your dog \"does his own thing\".<\/p> <p>There is no water inside the dog run, but there are water fountains and a doggie water fountain nearby. \u00a0Best advice: bring your own water or a container to hold water which you can carry easily. \u00a0No poop bags on site either.<\/p> <p>Nearest pubic restroom facilities are at Union Square.<\/p> <p>Saturdays appear to offer the best chance for on-street parking near the park, but if you can avoid driving... do so!<\/p> <p>Rusty and I will be driving from Brooklyn (no choice!) and we hope to meet many of you there!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Here are a few photos for a preview of the park:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/f\/8\/600_449548408.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/2\/3\/600_449548451.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/4\/5\/600_449548485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/5\/f\/600_449548511.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/1\/6\/600_65106422.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>IMPORTANT:\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Attendance at this MeetUp event is purely voluntary and you do so at your own risk.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By attending this MeetUp event you agree to hold harmless MeetUp.com, The Beagle Pack!, its Organizers and its Members, who assume NO liability for any injury, accident, loss of property or loss of life resulting from the use of this facility, or traveling to and from this facility, nor can they be held responsible for the actions of any aggressive dogs, irresponsible dog owners or patrons, or any hazardous conditions at the facility.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"NOTE:  IF RAIN IS FORECASTED AT THE TIME OF THE MEETUP EVENT, IT WILL BE RE-SCHEDULED ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY...

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>(photo of atrium and location of meetup table)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/4\/0\/600_433449280.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(photo of atrium entrance at the corner of 53rd and Lex.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

In this dynamic, interactive evening combining individual work with group process, you will learn techniques to liberate this energy and access more pleasure in your life. These techniques will be demonstrated through individual body readings with select participants who choose to take the risk of revealing a sexual issue and are willing to work through it in a supportive environment with expert guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid uses the teachings of Integral Evolutionary Tantra and the principles of Core Energetics to open up physical blocks and places where life energy doesn\u2019t move.

(or something like that)<\/p> <p>It's BBQ, but they DO NOT DO GOOD RIBS, this place is not about the ribs, it's about the BRISKET. Their ribs are weird, firm and with membranes still attached; you gotta get brisket or pulled pork, we'll ask Tyler, he knows.<\/p> <p>One really cool thing about this place is that they have these large bins where you can bring your beers and they provide the ice! Soon after writing this I'm gonna go to total wine and get some good beers. You all bring your own fancy beers, too.<\/p> <p>I figure after that we can go bowling. Montvale lanes is one of the few bowling places that doesn't mandate ear-raping you with loud ass music on the weekend bowling hours. Or we could go to a movie, I still haven't really gone to the new Nanuet mall.<\/p> <p>!!!DRIVING\/SPOTTING!!! It's pretty simple, it's on Broadway, in the section where the Shop-Rite is. I always recommend making a left onto Broadway from Kinderkamack once you hit those Hekemian apartments and the medical building no matter where you're going in the area, I find Broadway is always faster.

At a time when Islamophobia in the U.S. runs rampant and many view the Middle East with suspicion, efforts to create understanding are of the utmost importance. This exhibit, the title of which is inspired by a poem by Mahmoud Darwish, includes work by photographers Laura Boushnak, Tanya Habjouqa, Myriam Abdelaziz, and Tamara Abdul Hadi, members of the Rawiya photography collective. Rawiya aims to dispel stereotypes about this often misunderstood and underrepresented region by shining a light on the everyday hardships and shared experiences of its inhabitants, thereby encouraging a more compassionate and empathetic worldview. Within <i>In Her Absence I Created Her Image<\/i>, individual projects and varied themes contribute to an overarching theme of humanity, dignity, and empowerment.<\/p> <p>In <i>I Read I Write<\/i>, Boushnak delves into issues surrounding access to education, exploring the role of literacy in improving the lives of Arab women. Her photographs span across Tunisia, Yemen, Jordan, Egypt, and Kuwait, capturing arresting portraits young women for whom education is the first step in improving their lives. In <i>Occupied Pleasures<\/i>, Habjouqa explores the everyday existence of Palestinians who, with the threat of violence often overhead, seek out simple joys. Pain and pleasure are often opposite signs of the same coin and Habjouqa explores the paradoxes and humor resulting from everyday existence within a 47-year occupation. Abdelaziz strives to expose harsh child labor conditions as a result of the Egyptian economic crisis in <i>Menya\u2019s Kids<\/i>. Her young subjects emerge in a white haze of dust from the limestone quarries that they must cut with dangerous machinery, often prone to premature death from electrocution or injury. Finally, Abdul Hadi\u2019s <i>Picture an Arab Man<\/i> seeks to fight hypermasculine stereotypes surrounding the Arab male. Abdul Hadi provides the viewer with a portrayal of sensual beauty and vulnerability, defying the violent narrative that afflicts these men. The artists of Rawiya come together to show the world what it cannot always see: people not as caricatured victims, but intensely human, with an entire spectrum of vulnerabilities and intricacies they hold wholly their own.<\/p> <p>Rawiya, meaning \u201cshe who tells a story,\u201d is the first all-female photography collective from the Middle East. Members of the group include New York- and Cairo-based photographer Myriam Abdelaziz, Beirut-based photographer Tamara Abdul Hadi, Sarajevo-based photographer Laura Boushnak, and East Jerusalem-based photographer Tanya Habjouqa. As a group, Rawiya has exhibited at places such as the Empty Quarter Gallery (Lebanon), Contemporary Art Platform (Kuwait), Ernest G. Welch Gallery (USA), Bildmuseet Museum (Sweden), Modem Museum (Hungary), New Art Exchange (UK) and the Louisiana Museum (Denmark).<\/p> <p>This exhibit is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceGallery\/events\/230400569\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"OPENING RECEPTION: In Her Absence I Created Her Image","id":"230400569","time":1462662000000,"updated":1462670642000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442518768000,"name":"Open Source Gallery","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18941888,"urlname":"OpenSourceGallery","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":6.42701864243,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461727634000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Exhibitionists who don't know how to draw. Artists curious about exploring public nudity. Gay\/Straight. All those who seek a free and encouraging environment to explore the human form. You will learn something. You will make a friend. Come with a mind open to new experiences. This is a safe space.<\/p> <p>No cover - Donations greatly appreciated<br\/>RSVP - space is limited<\/p> <p>1) What IS Naked Drink n Draw?<br\/>*** It's an immersive study in figure drawing while under the influence. In short, you get naked, have some drinks, and draw each other. Sound fun? It is! I will generally start off the night as the first model. After that, we take a volunteer from the pool of artists. We'll continue to take turns as models while everyone else draws. The parlor will be set up for drawing, the work room will be set up for painting, and if enough people are in attendance, the bedroom may be made available for additional drawing space.<\/p> <p><br\/>2) I can\u2019t draw...<br\/>*** I can't draw either. It's not about that. Nobody's going to laugh at you if you suck. You could be god awful, but you may find you're better than you think. I can guarantee you won\u2019t be the only shitty artist in the room. Besides, the only way to improve is with practice, and what better way to learn?!<\/p> <p>3) Are the drawings judged?<br\/>*** There will be a period at the end to critique each others' work, but nobody has to participate. No obligations to share your work. If you are comfortable with your work being photographed, I would like to post it on the group pages.<\/p> <p>4) How much is it?<br\/>*** It\u2019s free! Of course, tips are greatly appreciated for snacks and supplies. It's normally $20 each but, if you can't afford it, we won't let that keep you from participating. it's called \"struggling artists\" for a reason.<\/p> <p>5) Can I model?<br\/>*** You are more than welcome to model. Take turns! Ideally, if we're all naked, we all stand an opportunity as model if we so desire. The only rule I have is you must be nude to pose. That is sort of the point, after all.<\/p> <p><br\/>6) What do I bring?<br\/>*** Bring supplies and booze. I will provide some supplies for those without, but I'm afraid I can not supply free booze. But hey, tip generously and I'll think about it ;P<\/p> <p>7) Can I take photos?<br\/>*** Nope. You can draw pictures, but you can\u2019t snap them. Why, you might ask? It's kinda creepy, in a room full of naked strangers, to pull out your camera. Even if you ask, putting one \"No\" on the spot in a room full of \"Yes\" is the sort of intimidation and alienation I'm hoping to avoid. Respect this rule, please. Don't be a creep.<\/p> <p>8) Who can come?<br\/>*** Anyone! with some conditions<br\/>-If I do not know you, and we have never spoken, shoot me a message first.<br\/>-If you want to bring a guest or three, let me know.<br\/>-If you want to come but not get naked, you better be the life of the party.<\/p> <p><br\/>9) Anything else I should know?<br\/>***This is a safe space with supportive people and a free and encouraging energy. While people will be naked, don't just assume that's license to read someone's ass like it's brail. Please be respectful, consensual adults. If you start to creep people out, you leave. Also, please be quiet in the stairwell. My neighbors are real sweet people, you guys.<\/p> <p>10) Where is it?<br\/>*** Ocean ave at Parkside Ave in Brooklyn. Parkside ave Q stop. Three buildings from the subway, on Ocean, across from the park.<\/p> <p>11) My boyfriend is not comfortable with me coming to this thing. Is this a sex party?<br\/>*** This is my home. Keep sexpectations to a minimum, and know the line between sex and sexy. We also have couples come to every event. If your significant other is jealous, bring them! That said, if anything grows while you pose, don't sweat it. Appreciate it.<\/p> <p>12) How many people will be there? Will it be crowded?<br\/>*** I'm saying maximum capacity is 30.

I started this group last year, and I want to keep it going, as sharing meditation with others is my passion. We'll meet Saturdays and Sundays at 10am under the big shady tree at the Great Hill in Central park (the entrance is Central Park west and 103rd street). Take the path leading into central park, and go left (up the slope) until you get to the clearing at the top of the hill. If it's rainy or bad weather, I won't be there, but if the suns out, you can find me under the hill. I will let the group know ahead of time if I have to cancel in advance. The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together. Look forward to seeing all of you!<\/p> <p>This meditation is free. A $5-10 donation is suggested, but not at all necessary.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At Central Park West and 103rd Street, take the path into Central Park.

Over the past 20 years, she has published over 75 peer-reviewed scientific papers in women\u2019s health and has served as an expert witness in multiple high-profile legal cases involving abortion and contraception.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

involved with the same woman in this disturbing, horrific drama.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jeremy-irons-p34545\">Jeremy Irons<\/a>\u00a0delivers a bravura performance as both Beverly and Elliot Mantle, Toronto-based surgeons who operate an exclusive gynecological clinic and share a reputation as brilliant innovators. They also share lovers, as the more aggressive, confident Elliott seduces women and later secretly allows the shier, more intellectual Beverly to reap the benefits. This arrangement is disturbed when Beverly falls in love with their newest conquest, Claire Niveau (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/genevieve-bujold-p9433\">Genevieve Bujold<\/a>), a famous actress with an unusual gynecological deformity. Beverly's relationship with the hard-living Claire leads to him to turn away from Elliot and begin a dangerous involvement with drugs and alcohol. Elliot senses his brother's rapid decline into addiction and paranoia and attempts to save him, only to start falling victim to the same urges. Director<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/david-cronenberg-p86249\">David Cronenberg<\/a>\u00a0adapted the loosely fact-based tale to his own creepy purposes, tapping into primal fears regarding the uncanniness of twins and male sexual panic. His notorious gore was used sparingly here, however, with the film's most disturbing moments coming through suggestion, as in the display of a group of terrifying surgical instruments created by Beverly in his madness. Cronenberg's expertise with special effects proves crucial, however, as he and his regular cinematographer\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/peter-suschitzsky-p113291\">Peter Suschitzsky<\/a>\u00a0seamlessly combine\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/irons-p34545\">Irons<\/a>' two performances in a manner unrivalled by any previous depiction of twins. This visual achievement is more than matched by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/irons-p34545\">Irons<\/a>, who delivers what may be his career performance, delineating the twins' differences and similarities and embodying their collapse in frighteningly believable fashion. The subject matter and chilly tone may be too intense for some viewers, but the brilliant central performance and intellectually provocative approach will prove thoroughly absorbing for others.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_xmheE3L19c\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_xmheE3L19c<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/230852035\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Dead Ringers 35mm film print movie starts at 1:30pm","id":"230852035","time":1462726800000,"updated":1462738692000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Read description.","name":"Read description below for time and details.","lon":-74.005974,"id":10442182,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460967748000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>CONFIRMED!\u00a0 The walk will take place.<\/p> <p>1-2 miles, easy, slow pace.

But instead of the peace they hoped to find, they\u2019re dumped in a gang-infested housing project outside of Paris, hardly less violent than the world they fled.

Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup.
