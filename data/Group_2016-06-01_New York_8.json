Toastmasters International is a world leader in communication and leadership development. Members of Toastmasters improve their speaking skills by attending recurring meetings where they deliver speeches or evaluate other speakers. Membership in Toastmasters is one of the greatest investments you can make in yourself. How Does It Work? A Toastmasters meeting is a learn-by-doing workshop in which participants hone their speaking and leadership skills in a no-pressure atmosphere. There is no instructor in a Toastmasters meeting. Instead, members evaluate one another\u2019s presentations. This feedback process is a key part of the program\u2019s success. Meeting participants also give impromptu talks on assigned topics, conduct meetings and develop skills related to timekeeping, grammar and parliamentary procedure.<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":104903722,"name":"Greg","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/highres_224217952.jpeg","photo_id":224217952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/member_224217952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/thumb_224217952.jpeg"}},"members":311,"name":"Harlem Toastmasters Meetup","id":16737912,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hollis","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1409622468000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"cruise-vacation","name":"Cruise Vacation","id":19052},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"finding-travel-companions-for-adventures","name":"Finding Travel Companions for Adventures","id":30015},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DONs-and-DIVAs-TRAVEL-GROUP\/","rating":4.43,"description":"<p>Calling All Travel Enthusiasts!<br>\n\nI started this group because I wanted to meet other Friendly Travels.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\nThis is a group for anyone interested in traveling \"near or far\", but does not like to go it ALONE.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All ages are welcome, but as our Group grows, we can separate trips for Singles, Families, and Couples looking to Travel together.<\/p>\n<p>We will also have \"Local Socials\", where you can meet other like-minded people to travel with and find out more information about our trips planned.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>Looking forward to exploring the \"THE WORLD\" with everybody,\u00a0together!<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>This is a group for anyone interested in traveling in groups small and large, who enjoy going to new places and meeting new people.

We already have this capability in place. However, in complex systems, the real operational challenges arise from the way system components interact. Some of these components live inside our data center, some live outside our data center, and all are updating on differing timelines. The functionality and performance of every component has the potential to change every day.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge is to identify patterns and correlations across multiple systems in our stack. We need to integrate top-down and bottom-up analysis, so we can see, for example, that trial subscription signups (a user metric) fell off at the same time that an internal API call began to fail (an application metric), and it was caused by a database host falling offline (a system metric).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>When collecting so much data, there is a risk of being overwhelmed and not being able to make sense of it all. In essence, a risk of collecting data but not producing intelligence. We combat this risk by converting our accumulated data into the most visually information-dense format available: graphs. Then we make graphs easy to compare and easy to share. We make them informative at a glance and easy for the team to keep watching. Finally, once we are regularly identifying patterns across our graphs, we should have an automated way to \"watch the graphs\" in our absence. It is not an AI or a pattern recognition \"black box\", it should just automate patterns that humans have first validated to be meaningful.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/highres_407606402.jpeg","photo_id":407606402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/600_407606402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/thumb_407606402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":39920892,"name":"NYLinuxUs3r","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/highres_242207213.jpeg","photo_id":242207213,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/member_242207213.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/thumb_242207213.jpeg"}},"members":547,"name":"Monitoring NYC","id":16870002,"state":"NY","urlname":"Monitoring-NYC","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Monitors"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410189115000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"palestinian","name":"Palestinian Rights","id":2069},{"urlkey":"progmuslim","name":"Progressive Muslim","id":6866},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"interfaith","name":"Interfaith","id":10827},{"urlkey":"jewish","name":"Jewish","id":16684},{"urlkey":"interfaith-and-intercultural-dialogue","name":"Interfaith and intercultural dialogue","id":42728},{"urlkey":"israelis","name":"Israelis","id":62453}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dialogueproject\/","rating":0,"description":"We work on ourselves to develop mutual trust, relationships and partnerships \u2013 long time citizens, new immigrants, Palestinians, Israelis and people of diverse faiths and cultures.

Acting now is in America\u2019s best interest.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street is the game changer for a fairer, more democratic, humane, balanced, and moral American Tax System<\/p>\n<p>This tiny sales tax on Wall Street is:<br>\n\n .5% on stocks, just $.50 (50 cents) for each $100 of stock trades;<br>\n\n .1% on bonds, just $.10 (ten cents) for each $100 of bond trades;<br>\n\n .005% on derivative speculation in currencies, commodities, or other trades, just $.005 (half a penny) for each $100 of trades<\/p>\n<p>The revenue generated is estimated by economists to be up to 350 billion each year! The Robin Hood Tax can mean slightly less for the 1% at the top and lots more for the 99% below.<\/p>\n<p>Our Current Sales Tax System Does Not Tax the Items That the Top 10% American Households (by Wealth) almost exclusively own.<br>\n\n Things everyone has to buy have a Sales Tax like toilet paper, toothpaste, cars, condo\u2019s and homes. Things only the top 10% of Wealthy Households buy have no sales tax. Sadly that\u2019s True.<\/p>\n<p>Even Worse the top ten percent of American Households have 81% to 94% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and almost 80% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America. Sadly this is another clear example of: Those that have the gold get to make the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations representing over 100,000,000 Americans are now involved with the American Robin Hood Tax Campaign. Thousands of endorsers, 100\u2019s of Organization endorsers, over 1,000 economists, the Vatican, Some of the brightest minds in the country and the 4 of the richest men in America, have endorsed the Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Three Benefits of the Robin Hood Tax<br>\n\n Although every Robin Hood Tax has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.<br>\n\n Curbing volatility of financial markets<br>\n\n In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, \"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.\" Rescuing enterprise from becoming \"the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation\" was also an intended purpose of the Robin Hood Tax and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes.<br>\n\n More fair and equitable tax collection<br>\n\n Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. An Automated Payment Robin Hood tax taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.<br>\n\n According to several leading figures, the \"fairness\" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and\/or replaced, \"prevention of volatility\" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative is one such economist: he sees a Robin Hood Tax as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.[23]<br>\n\n Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives<br>\n\n According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. An Automated Payment Robin Hood Tax employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Stop Blaming the Poor for Wall Streets Greed<\/p>\n<p>Warren Buffett isn\u2019t the only rich guy who wants to higher taxes on the rich, such as The Robin Hood tax which he has specifically endorsed. A survey from Spectrem Group found that 68% of millionaires (those with investments of $1 million or more) support raising taxes on those with $1 million or more in income. Fully 61% of those worth of $5 million or more support increased taxes on million-plus earners.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/highres_409075492.jpeg","photo_id":409075492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/600_409075492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/thumb_409075492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":170802232,"name":"Robin Hood","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/highres_226474072.jpeg","photo_id":226474072,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/member_226474072.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/thumb_226474072.jpeg"}},"members":3,"name":"Manhattan - Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street Campaign Events","id":16974892,"state":"NY","urlname":"Robin-Hood-Tax-on-Wall-Street-Campaign-Events-USA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Robin Hood's Team Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410639851000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"night-photography","name":"Night Photography","id":32968},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"night-photography-workshop","name":"night photography workshop","id":127998}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYNight\/","rating":4.54,"description":"<p>New York has a long, rich history of night photography.

We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, will be judged, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can\u2019t trust the future, we need more ambition and drive, and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world \u2014 full-out. We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be. For more information about Byron Katie and her work, go to thework.com or read her book Loving What Is. There are plenty of youtube.com videos of Katie doing The Work with others and explaining how The Work works. &nbsp;Another good addition to this meetup is my meetup \"Marketing for Artists and Other Creative People\" at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon at our meet up! &nbsp; &nbsp;Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/highres_444638292.jpeg","photo_id":444638292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/600_444638292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_444638292.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14005872,"name":"DezVFX","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/highres_12033901.jpeg","photo_id":12033901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/member_12033901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/thumb_12033901.jpeg"}},"members":1489,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","id":17017142,"state":"NY","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Creative People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410833210000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"merengue","name":"Merengue","id":20216},{"urlkey":"hustle-dancing","name":"Hustle Dancing","id":21002},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"latin-dancing-salsa-merengue","name":"Latin Dancing - Salsa, Merengue","id":33158},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"salsa-for-singles","name":"Salsa for Singles","id":52314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProAmDanceTeamNYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Do You enjoy dancing Latin, Ballroom, Salsa or all of these dances?

TO THE ORIGINAL BRONX DESIGN MEETUP GROUP<\/p>\n<p>About The Organizer: <br><\/p>\n<p>Hi! My Name is Monica Liu. I started an online Art and Design service named Mon Liu Designs and Art Studio. I run a guest house in The Bronx for traveling artists and professionals who comes from all over the world, currently looking to expand our studios into Queens, hoping to break in to NYC soon. I graduated at The New York School of Interior Design, and an ongoing Student Artist at the Art Student League of New York. I am also a mother of a very open hearted toddler boy. I have covered a variety of mediums: Mix Media Art, Fiber Art, Paper Art and Origami, Painting, Drawing, Set and stage design, Photography and Filmmaking, Economical Friendly Art Installations, Murals, Technical Drafting, Interior Design, Computer-Aid-Design and Architecture.<br><\/p>\n<p>My interest in building a group is: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. To meet Designers and Artists where we can all exchange and learn from each others work. <br><\/p>\n<p>2. To create a meditative space where we can create our work.<\/p>\n<p>3. I make sure part of my meetups are dedicated to parents with small children who never had the chance to get to know the passion inside of themselves and hoping they can find a space here to create artistically. <br><\/p>\n<p>4. I am a lover of traveling so I love to hear and share stories from people that come from other countries and go to visit the country myself to learn about different cultures.<\/p>\n<p>If What you are looking for is 3 or more of the above, You are encouraged to join! We are all about creating a positive lifestyle with arts and retreats. <br><\/p>\n<p> About The Group:<br><\/p>\n<p>We are CREATIVE DESIGNERS who are not just about pick and choose materials for a space but also working creatively on making a space, indoor or out, into creative spaces such as customized ceiling murals, economical-friendly Installations\/ Visual Displays. <br><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever wonder how to get a project started? or have you gotten in the middle of a project and needed someone to give you a nudge to help you thinking outside the box so you can see the project at a new perspective? How about brainstorming with collages, or coming up with a design pattern for a partition wall? How do I achieve that result?&nbsp; I am here to help you spark that creativity within you.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>It sounds fantastic, and we need pure confidence. Knowing that we can make something seems impossible at times when we are so caught up in our lives. SO here I am, working on the creative person in me, I want to create a group to come together with those who are at a creative block at times like myself, we all need some inspiration. We all have build-up on creativity when we dont use it, We're are all talented with something. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are at beginning level, Graduated or an Emerging Professional who did, or learning all aspects of design or getting creative with art projects, me and others are here to encourage you to get that project started and accomplished! To be sure that you get the practice with sufficient hands on experience. <br> <\/p>\n<p>We are based in the Bronx, but we will be holding some meet ups in New York City, go to shows &amp; events, design shops and workshops as we learn to do artistic things like drawing, painting and the process of making something creative. Depending on the experience of our Design Enthusiasts available, we hope to put together some hands-on real projects experiences and tailor meet ups according to our members, so be sure to let us know what you hope to achieve with us. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our group pages at the top panel, as we will consistently update inspirational websites of Art and Design Trends. Also, come back check out our calendar even when there are no meetup scheduled, we could be meeting up with other interior design group events in the city. If you have something in mind, be sure to let us know what you like to see and achieve at an upcoming meetup and we will surely do our best to tailor our meetups to the best of our group member's interest. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join us Now!<br> <\/p>\n<p>To get to know me and my company, please stay tune and find me on Pinterest and Facebook and the following links:<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest.com\/monliudesigns<\/p>\n<p><span>Mon Liu Designs Gallery &amp; Inspirations<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/\">&nbsp;&nbsp; https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/highres_440584449.jpeg","photo_id":440584449,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/600_440584449.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/thumb_440584449.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55263712,"name":"Monica Judy Liu","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/highres_130662532.jpeg","photo_id":130662532,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/member_130662532.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/thumb_130662532.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"Upper NYC Design & Art Group","id":17244512,"state":"NY","urlname":"UpperNyc-Design-Art-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Creative Designers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411842562000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"electronicmusic","name":"Electronic Music","id":411},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"housemusic","name":"House Music","id":6672},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"clubbing","name":"Clubbing","id":17969},{"urlkey":"electronic-dance-music","name":"Electronic Dance Music","id":17970},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"djs","name":"DJs","id":24129},{"urlkey":"experimental-electronic-music","name":"Experimental Electronic Music","id":39086},{"urlkey":"trance-music","name":"Trance Music","id":80398}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EDM-Electronic-Dance-Music\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all Dancing and Electronica lovers!<\/p>\n<p>New to the area and exploring the CT EDM scene?&nbsp; I just moved here and have built large groups of amazing individuals in the past in other states, so let's refer some EDM &lt;3 <br> <\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Let's refer and build a MASSIVE EDM group in CT!

We want to avoid competitive training and promote co-operative collaboration and mutual support. Our desire is to be quite unique...to be VERY different than the stereotype that music educators often seem to portray. Check out (info@beyondrock.org) (facebook.com\/beyondrockcamp). That 2-4 week summer program is a model of something 'truly' unique. We desire a year round expansion of that program...this is our ultimate goal... classes, lessons, diverse workshops, showcases, etc.\u00a0 Anyone who wants to serve kids\/teens with teaching and coaching rock\/pop\/alternative\/hip-hop\/etc. music (as primary) but ALSO in various other areas... conflict resolution, acceptance of new ideas, theater improv therapy (through theater games), yoga, an array of creative activities and community and confidence reinforcement. Helping kids\/teens \"step outside their comfort zones\" with no fear of judgement. The teaching is one thing and takes exceptional people... still, it's the skilled, strategic, pro-active, organization, directorship and management part that is the really tough part.\u00a0 It takes the combination of educator, humanitarian and entrepreneur to implement such a mission. With all participants from administration to volunteers to equipment setup to instructors...we absolutely prefer the concept of the 'work WITH' mentality...we're not all that fond of the term 'work FOR'. A socialistic, democratic angle to building a company...perhaps...but it seems to work amazingly well with Beyond Rock. A feeling of ownership is essential to develop passion in an individual. That said, obviously there still needs to be an agreement on philosophy and mission and those individuals who thoughtfully plan &amp; guide - leading the course of events. They need to be sharp, very pro-active, extraordinarily communicative (staff, parents, students) and decisive.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/highres_415797942.jpeg","photo_id":415797942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/600_415797942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_415797942.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":116670792,"name":"Maria,Scott & Michael (founders)","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/highres_242605358.jpeg","photo_id":242605358,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/member_242605358.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/thumb_242605358.jpeg"}},"members":96,"name":"Business Entrepreneurs With Music Education in Mind","id":17300272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-Educators-With-Spiritual-Based-Business-in-Mind","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Educators Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412041509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"transgender","name":"TG","id":1237},{"urlkey":"genderqueer","name":"genderqueer","id":4562},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gender-fluid","name":"Gender Fluid","id":25560},{"urlkey":"gender-queer","name":"Gender Queer","id":34510},{"urlkey":"where-to-meet-other-tg-people","name":"Where to Meet other TG People","id":37560},{"urlkey":"shemales","name":"Shemales","id":49111},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"queer-and-questioning","name":"Queer and Questioning","id":53773},{"urlkey":"male-to-female-mtf-transgender","name":"Male to Female, MTF, Transgender","id":62199},{"urlkey":"transsexuals","name":"Transsexuals","id":63635},{"urlkey":"transgender-women","name":"Transgender Women","id":67037},{"urlkey":"transgender-mtf","name":"Transgender MtF","id":138956},{"urlkey":"tgirl","name":"tgirl","id":503042},{"urlkey":"transgender-non-binary","name":"TransGender \u00b7 Non-Binary","id":1497202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonbinary-Safe-Space-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>There are not a lot of safe spaces for nonbinary\/gender variant individuals to meet and socialize, so we've taken the liberty of creating one in NYC.

Join our fun filled environment, meet new people (who also love dancing), &nbsp;and learn the most important concepts of dance, music, and body movement.<\/p>\n<p>A little sample of our work in San Francisco:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zij9c5l5j8s\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zij9c5l5j8s<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more information about our dance classes and to keep in touch with us, visit our website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyclatinballroom.com\">www.nyclatinballroom.com<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/highres_437734079.jpeg","photo_id":437734079,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/600_437734079.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/f\/thumb_437734079.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":174908692,"name":"Arkadiy Stepanchuk","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/0\/0\/highres_231358112.jpeg","photo_id":231358112,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/0\/0\/member_231358112.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/0\/0\/thumb_231358112.jpeg"}},"members":614,"name":"New York Latin Ballroom Dancing Lessons","id":17361602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Ballroom-Latin-Dancing-Meetup","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Ballroom Dance Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412279228000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"speed-dating","name":"Speed Dating","id":15233},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"singles-dancing","name":"Singles Dancing","id":19144},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"20-somethings","name":"20 somethings","id":50188},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"single-professionals-20s-40s","name":"Single Professionals 20's-40's","id":65341},{"urlkey":"singles-singles-singles","name":"Singles, Singles, Singles","id":115707},{"urlkey":"20-and-30-something-singles","name":"20 and 30 something singles","id":200801},{"urlkey":"speed-dating-20s-and-30s","name":"Speed Dating 20s and 30s","id":484552}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Singles-events-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for singles ages 20s &amp; 30s who<span>&nbsp;live in the New York City area.

Women all over the world are waking up to a new renaissance of the heart, soul and body, reclaiming her inner voice and taking steps towards freedom.<\/p>\n<p>For the last five years I have been repairing my relationship with my&nbsp;mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies.&nbsp;I overcame breast cancer and had to take a really hard look at all the emotional toxins and mindset I was carrying around from my relationship with my parents and then men, I was acting out subconsciously, seeking love from a pain point. My wounds were speaking louder than my heart, they began to show me how unhappy I was. Fast forward five years to today. Today I travel and teach throughout North America sharing with women Soul Therapy Seminars and a Journey to Self Love, a two day emotionally empowering discovery of learning how to love yourself, honestly, courageously and with joy. I know you have been yearning to share with a group of women who have your back, seeking support from others who can understand your own journey, acknowledging your pain while uplifting you to greater new heights of self awareness. You've been ready for a long time now, searching and seeking your own journey to self love. I've been there, let me help guide you along the way so that you can get there with the support that you need to accelerate your life to one of freedom and inner peace. I am grateful to be able to share with you all that I have learned on my own journey to self love!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join me in&nbsp;this powerful group of women as we explore&nbsp;self love, while learning how to connect deeply to your authentic self, the part of you that is desiring to live a powerfully expressed life. There is that small voice that wants to be heard, understood, acknowledged and loved, that part is your authentic self: your soul.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Goldfarb, Licensed Soul Therapist, Spiritual Healer &amp; Guide<\/p>\n<p><span><b>Testimonials:<\/b><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I had the pleasure of taking Carolyn's \"A Journey To Self Love\" group class and it was amazing! She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. <b>- Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me. <b>- Alexandra B., NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before.

While we are primarily East Coast, Brooklyn based gamers, our online community contains gamers who we regularly play with across many different States (Utah, Colorado, New Orleans, Massachusetts... etc), across many different platforms and games. We also keep in contact with one another across many different mediums, such as facebook, skype, internet forums, and regular text. As gamers we are all adults, with full-time jobs, some with families, and\/or pursing further schooling. As a result, our atmosphere is drama-free, friendly, and mature. Who has time for drama when you have work in the morning? Ages 21+ is our preferred atmosphere. We enjoy online gaming not just as a hobby, but also a means to foster communities and build friendships. Many of us, are not just fellow gamers who share in a hobby, but are also real life friends. Many of those friendships were formed within different online gaming communities across the decade. We hope our meetup group will continue to build these types of positive relationships created by gaming. As a gaming group, we are an eclectic group with different tastes who all consider online gaming a hobby. Many of us are both casual and hardcore online gamers, with roots also stemming in tabletop and collectible card games (MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh, Versus, Pokemon, D&amp;D... etc).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We are currently engaged in Destiny for the Playstation 4 and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn across multiple platforms and are actively recruiting. While online guilds and clans are a-plenty, our group likes to know who we're playing with. If you're interested in joining our local online gaming community and our other extended online gaming community, we tend to meet-up at different places in Brooklyn and NYC.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In addition, think of our meetup as a way to meet new people who might be playing other online games as well. We hope this is an opportunity to form brand new communities, organic, specifically to meetup. Take the opportunity to meet new people and see what types of games they play.

You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a<br>\n\n book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent<br>\n\n frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk<br>\n\n politics.<\/p>\n<p>Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths,<br>\n\n you feel the bond of common ground.

Drinking and driving is reckless and<br>\n\n irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't<br>\n\n do it.<\/p>\n<p>It began in New York City in May, 2003, when it felt as though the<br>\n\n politicians, press and public were giving conservative cons a free pass.<br>\n\n We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session,<br>\n\n playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be<br>\n\n saying.<\/p>\n<p>And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made<br>\n\n buttons.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back<br>\n\n up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards.<br>\n\n But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a<br>\n\n space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and<br>\n\n enlarge a circle of progressive friends.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/highres_419391462.jpeg","photo_id":419391462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/600_419391462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/thumb_419391462.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197398488,"name":"JCPC"},"members":547,"name":"Drinking Liberally NYC","id":17535782,"state":"NY","urlname":"Drinking-Liberally-NYC","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Proud Liberals"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412976329000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mensa","name":"Mensa","id":311},{"urlkey":"gifted","name":"Gifted Adults and Children","id":10476},{"urlkey":"smart-people","name":"Smart People","id":16148},{"urlkey":"intelligent-conversation","name":"Intelligent Conversation","id":45071},{"urlkey":"high-iq","name":"High IQ","id":71674}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup\/","rating":4.58,"description":"<p>A Meetup Group for members of Greater New York Mensa<\/p>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.GNYM.org\">www.GNYM.org<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/highres_439547040.jpeg","photo_id":439547040,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/600_439547040.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/thumb_439547040.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":36158832,"name":"Laura Catania","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/highres_236798392.jpeg","photo_id":236798392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/member_236798392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/thumb_236798392.jpeg"}},"members":108,"name":"Greater New York Mensa Meetup","id":17538592,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Mensans"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412990206000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dogrescue","name":"Dog Rescue","id":109},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"animalrescue","name":"Animal Rescue","id":10495},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"giant-large-breed-dogs","name":"Giant\/Large Breed Dogs","id":19162},{"urlkey":"dog-friendly-events","name":"Dog Friendly Events","id":22760},{"urlkey":"animals","name":"Animals","id":37663},{"urlkey":"pets-animals","name":"Pets","id":53052},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"large-breed-dogs","name":"Large Breed Dogs","id":687062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DoggyBnBnyc\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>Calling all PET LOVERS in the New York pet community. <br><br>DoggyBnB is a new Dog Sitting Social Network.

It started in 2003, during what was a fairly rough time to be politically liberal, as a group that was one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought the political left needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If any of this resonates with you, this group is the right place for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those of us who do not want to watch our unlived life go by -- the one we know in our hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other without judgment, and create a community that promotes and celebrates risk-taking for your heart's goals (which, unfortunately, our families, friends and society are not always on board with).

Several times a week, the oven would be fired and everyone from the community would gather at the oven to bake their bread.<\/p>\n<p>We were inspired by the vision of bringing people together around a shared hearth, so when we returned to Brooklyn, we looked for a brick oven that hosted public events. The Old Stone House had a small but beautiful outdoor oven and invited us to use it, and that was the beginning of our monthly Open Community Baking Day!<\/p>\n<p>In 2014 we started the Brick Oven Brooklyn meetup group to help coordinate and plan the oven days, and it's been taking off ever since! Now we're at nearly 400 members and growing. We recently launched Build Your Own Pizza days.

Single Parents Sharing Resources is a cooperative that will enable single parents to built networks to create a practical support system in Rockland\/Bergen Counties and Western Westchester, to empower families socially, spiritually, and economically.<\/p>\n<p><span>Single parents can be isolated and overworked. This group will enable members to team up with other local single parents to share childcare, share resources, and share rent\/mortgages (homesharing). Meetups will enable parents to meet and connect with other like-minded single parents looking to create practical support systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Even finding one other parent to team up with to share meals with on a weekly basis can be a boon, reducing the workload and creating social connections and support (for example: dinner at your house Tuesdays, dinner at my house Wednesdays).

The group offers a variety of invites from relaxing happy hours or brunches to dance parties or enjoyable trips so those who want to connect or make new friends can benefit. <br><\/p>\n<p>PS: Check out my other meetup group: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewYorkCosmopolitanOutingsandParties\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewYorkCosmopolitanOutingsandParties\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-74.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/e\/3\/highres_436629699.jpeg","photo_id":436629699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/e\/3\/600_436629699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/e\/3\/thumb_436629699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10458611,"name":"Kay Alva","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/f\/9\/highres_246936345.jpeg","photo_id":246936345,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/f\/9\/member_246936345.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/f\/9\/thumb_246936345.jpeg"}},"members":603,"name":"Glam Gatherings at NJ & NY-Jersey City, NYC, Hoboken & etc.!","id":17932132,"state":"NJ","urlname":"GlamGatherings","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Glam Gals & GQ Guys"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414548727000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"jewish","name":"Jewish","id":16684},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"jewish-social","name":"Jewish Social","id":17818},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"bible","name":"Bible","id":40388},{"urlkey":"community-action","name":"Community Action","id":40895},{"urlkey":"relationship-building","name":"Relationship Building","id":49581},{"urlkey":"community-participation","name":"Community participation","id":162550}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HopeHillNYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>WELCOME <br>Hope Hill is a fresh and exciting church that meets weekly at 236 W. 72nd St. in Manhattan.

Brain Body Mastery has two main components. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindfulness\">mindfulness<\/a> and other types of meditation, or low stimulus attention control, meaning focusing in a slow and quiet way. The other component is high stimulus attention control, which is about taking simple movements and brain exercises, and integrating them into complex, whole brain activities. They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain. Practice mindfulness or meditation, and you grow your brain. Even just practice being curious once in a while, and usually your brain grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The goal of BrBd is to be as <b>in control of our conscious energy<\/b> as possible. The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions.

I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/highres_112494562.jpeg","photo_id":112494562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/member_112494562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/thumb_112494562.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"East Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414862083000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"autism","name":"Autism","id":637},{"urlkey":"adhd","name":"ADHD","id":12126},{"urlkey":"autism-moms","name":"Moms of Autistic Kids","id":23808},{"urlkey":"special-needs-families","name":"Special Needs Families","id":36792},{"urlkey":"special-needs-socialization-and-play-group","name":"Special Needs Socialization and Play Group","id":44228},{"urlkey":"adults-with-special-needs-disabilities","name":"Adults with Special Needs, Disabilities","id":63050},{"urlkey":"parents-of-special-needs-children","name":"Parents of Special Needs Children","id":71210},{"urlkey":"parents-of-children-with-special-needs","name":"parents of children with special needs","id":74636},{"urlkey":"playgroup-for-special-needs-kids","name":"Playgroup for Special Needs Kids","id":93615},{"urlkey":"support-for-parents-of-special-needs-kids","name":"Support for Parents of Special Needs Kids","id":102721},{"urlkey":"special-needs-kids","name":"Special Needs Kids","id":107268},{"urlkey":"moms-of-special-needs-kids-in-need-of-support","name":"Moms of Special Needs Kids in Need of Support","id":1023952},{"urlkey":"support-for-single-mothers-of-special-needs-kids","name":"support for single mothers of special needs kids","id":1334332}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/East-Brunswick-Special-Needs-Families-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"My husband and I just moved to the East Brunswick area from Brooklyn.

It is intended for tech and non-tech alike, public and private, academics, founders, students, investors, city officials, visitors to NYC and more. We post sharing economy happenings across New York. <\/p> \n<p> The Sharing Economy often involves a shift towards interactions between peers and a more sustainable use of resources. It creates a new economic paradigm built on distributed networks of connected individuals and communities rather than on centralized institutions. (You may have heard people refer to it as collaborative consumption, the peer economy and the collaborative economy.) This new economic model is changing our daily lives, our communities, what it means to have a \u201cjob,\u201d our cities, and the planet. <\/p> \n<p> The NY Sharing Economy Meetup is a collaborative organization driven by its members. All members are invited to suggest events that will enable the community to better understand the potential and challenges of this new economy, leverage new technologies, benefit from new opportunities, hear about cutting-edge research, experience new ways of sharing and much more.

Our objective is to present public concerts of Songs from India - different regions and languages, in a chorus style, sprinkled with solos. We generally stay away from Bollywood songs. In concerts, we employ live orchestra for accompaniment. Our orchestra is a collection of Indian and Western instruments. While our music is authentically Indian, our performance is a bit fusion in style. Our presentation style is formal and professional, sort of like that of the New York Philharmonic in Lincoln Center.<\/p>\n<p> Our recent concert on October 4, 2015, consisted of 12 non-Bollywood songs from different regions of India. It was a spectacular success and received 10+ minutes spontaneous standing ovation. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are always looking for new singers to join us. If you would like to sing with us or play ANY Indian instrument reasonably well, please contact us. We are located in Hastings on Hudson, NY. <br><\/p>\n<p>We do expect long term commitment for rehearsals and performance. There is a simple audition process before acceptance into the chorus.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to visit our blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/highres_442866637.jpeg","photo_id":442866637,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/600_442866637.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/thumb_442866637.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4779472,"name":"Avinash Lall","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/highres_240761462.jpeg","photo_id":240761462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/member_240761462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/thumb_240761462.jpeg"}},"members":39,"name":"Westchester Music of India Group","id":18122872,"state":"NY","urlname":"Westchester-Music-of-India-Group","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.9700012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1415318532000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cashflow","name":"Cashflow","id":885},{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"multifamily-investing","name":"Multifamily Investing","id":58294},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-investments","name":"Commercial Real Estate Investments","id":70646},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-financing","name":"Commercial Real Estate Financing","id":71534},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-networking","name":"Commercial Real Estate Networking","id":77426},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-management","name":"Commercial Real Estate Management","id":77427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crowne-Management\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Greetings Everyone,<\/p>\n<p>Crowne Management is a full service property management, with the ability to handle services in commercial, rental and condominium buildings industries.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has the absolute goal to deliver the most efficient solutions and results.

China, as the world\u2019s biggest exporter, and the United States, as the world\u2019s biggest importer, are two major trade players. However, due to language and geographical issues, there still has been a gap between U.S. and China\u2019s businessmen\/businesswomen in terms of information symmetry and efficiency of resource integration. <\/p>\n<p>We understand that the businessmen\/businesswomen in the U.S. are eager to find accessible sources of high quality products with lower cost, and at the same time, a number of giant manufacturers in China are looking for opportunities to expand their global sales networks and sell their products in a more cost-efficient way.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Our Mission:<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>We

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4.

There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>Bring a towel or sit on your shirt. Please be hygienic.<\/p>\n<p>Be mindful of your stuff (wallet, phone, etc). MNDGNY or the venues are not responsible for lost or stolen items.<\/p>\n<p>Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please put out some of your drawings so others can see them. If you\u2019re working in a notebook, show your drawings to the person taking photographs so he can take some snapshots. TAKE YOUR DRAWINGS HOME WITH YOU!<\/p>\n<p>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<\/p>\n<p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW; IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION? At regular sessions, there is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. From time to time, there will be special classes with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A NAKED EVENT BEFORE. WHAT'S IT LIKE?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. At studio venues, there are usually about 15-20 artists, at private homes about 10 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed after checking in and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, the poses can be sexual. <\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER POSED BEFORE. Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We'll help you out if you want, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. There is a sign-up sheet for poses with about 12-15 posing slots per session (varying lengths 5-20 minutes) so not everyone poses at each session. First-timers are not required to pose.&nbsp;Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IS THIS A GAY GROUP?&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexual so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT'S THE SEXUAL ENERGY OF THE GROUP LIKE?&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies depending on who shows up and is often higher at private homes but the focus is always on the art. This is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT IF I GET AN ERECTION?&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.<\/p>\n<p>WHO KEEPS THE DRAWINGS THAT I POSED FOR?&nbsp;Each artist keeps his own drawings. The model can ask for\/trade\/buy other artists' drawings.<\/p>\n<p>Organized by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shungaboy\">Shungaboy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our social media:<\/p>\n<p>Our Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.com...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MNDGNY\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/M...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Facebook Page:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mndgny\">https:\/\/www.facebook....<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Wordpress Blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.wordpre...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Updated 3\/12\/2016<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/highres_432143748.jpeg","photo_id":432143748,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/600_432143748.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/thumb_432143748.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":16687501,"name":"Shungaboy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/highres_212791212.jpeg","photo_id":212791212,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/member_212791212.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/thumb_212791212.jpeg"}},"members":397,"name":"Men's Naked Drawing Group NY","id":18232572,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mens-Naked-Drawing-Group-NY","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Naked Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1417737855000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nursing","name":"Nursing","id":385},{"urlkey":"medresident","name":"Medical Residents","id":6991},{"urlkey":"healthpros","name":"Health Professionals","id":7102},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"healthcare-it","name":"Healthcare IT","id":19076},{"urlkey":"medical","name":"Medical","id":19224},{"urlkey":"healthcare-professionals","name":"Healthcare Professionals","id":22572},{"urlkey":"medicine","name":"Medicine","id":23576},{"urlkey":"medical-professionals","name":"Medical Professionals","id":34081},{"urlkey":"doctors","name":"Doctors","id":34996},{"urlkey":"physician","name":"Physician","id":35782},{"urlkey":"medical-doctors","name":"Medical Doctors","id":44090},{"urlkey":"physician-networking-opportunities","name":"Physician Networking Opportunities","id":57319},{"urlkey":"healthcare-innovation","name":"Healthcare Innovation","id":154951},{"urlkey":"doctors-business-networking","name":"Doctors Business Networking","id":156490}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheNYCHealthcareGroup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The NYC Healthcare Group is the number one Meetup for healthcare providers &amp; professionals in New York City.

Looking forward to getting the dogs together :)<\/p>","lon":-74.3199996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/highres_445753195.jpeg","photo_id":445753195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/600_445753195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/thumb_445753195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8637597,"name":"Sara Wilder","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/highres_5550704.jpeg","photo_id":5550704,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/member_5550704.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/thumb_5550704.jpeg"}},"members":110,"name":"Central NJ Small-dogs","id":18251496,"state":"NJ","urlname":"smalldog-centraljersey-meetup","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.4000015259,"who":"Small dog lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418524227000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"organic-foods","name":"Organic Foods","id":15485},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"wild-foods","name":"Wild Foods","id":22095},{"urlkey":"raw-and-living-food-potlucks","name":"Raw and Living Food Potlucks","id":41683},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"knowledge-sharing","name":"Knowledge Sharing","id":65780},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Food-and-Recipe-Sharing-Meetup-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>If you love food then this is the group for you.

Unless otherwise noted, every group breathe and Brooklyn Breathwork event costs $25.<\/p>\n<p>Rebirthing Breathwork, also commonly referred to as rebirthing or conscious connected breathing, is an acceleration of the healing process through an exploration and practice of the breath. Bypassing the mind entirely, the rebirthing breath goes deep into your cells, saturating the body with both oxygen and life force, and helps to release any negative self-thought, perceived limitations, past trauma or any uncomfortable feelings that are held in the body. It is a truly transformational modality that helps the breather recognize their union with their higher self and all of life with peace and absolute love.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13679717,"name":"Anna","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/d\/2\/highres_216591922.jpeg","photo_id":216591922,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/d\/2\/member_216591922.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/d\/2\/thumb_216591922.jpeg"}},"members":118,"name":"Brooklyn Breathwork","id":18268827,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Breathwork","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Breathers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419295611000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"infj","name":"INFJ","id":3381},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"infp","name":"INFP","id":6398},{"urlkey":"mbti","name":"Myers-Briggs Type Indicator","id":9714},{"urlkey":"enfp","name":"ENFP","id":9823},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"intuition","name":"Intuition","id":18371},{"urlkey":"enfj","name":"ENFJ","id":27761},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"highly-sensitive-people","name":"Highly Sensitive People","id":37553},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Idealists-NF-INFP-INFJ-ENFP-ENFJ-meetup-Age-30\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Our Meetup Purpose:<\/b> This is a group for mature Myers-Briggs \"iNtuitive Feelers\" (NF) who want to meet other intuitive feelers for deeper and more intimate conversations and connections.&nbsp; Approximately one in ten people fit the NF personality profile.&nbsp; If you are not sure if you fit the profile, click \"Pages\" up above, and click on the free test link to take a personality test. &nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p>Our group of NFs will favor positive, uplifting, and inspiring conversations amongst those of us over 30 years old.&nbsp; It will be a supportive environment where we can learn and grow.

If you're an experienced actor, skilled screen writer, or an editor looking to experiment like this, please join.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3404004,"name":"Van Nguyen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/1\/highres_256920449.jpeg","photo_id":256920449,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/1\/member_256920449.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/1\/thumb_256920449.jpeg"}},"members":97,"name":"NYC make a film scene during your lunch break","id":18277104,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-lunch-break","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cutrushers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edison","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419721756000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"careers","name":"Career","id":22888},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TEACHANDLEARNCNJ\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p><b>Welcome to the Central NJ chapter of Teach and Learn Networking!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Events - Community - Consulting<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs, business professionals, we know how you feel about networking. <b>It sucks.<\/b> Unless there's free wine involved, walking up to strangers and talking about work (after you've worked all day) sounds like torture.<\/p>\n<p><i>Does a professional networking event have to feel like a middle school dance?<\/i> <b>No.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Teach and Learn Networking believes in curating environments where sharing ideas, resources, and network power feels natural.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>How do we do that?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Good question.

I adore great films and even more, sharing my opinions, hearing other's opinions and having lively discussions about movies. I would love to gather together other movie buffs to see movies in a theater and then do brunch, lunch or dinners where we talk about the film and just have fun. Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient. See you at the movies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: I appreciate yearly dues of $5.00 which are given to me at first meetup.<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and do not show up and do not notify us, you will be removed.

I am, having returned to Brooklyn after a decade in Queens! Perhaps, like me, you do a lot in Manhattan, but wish you could also just hang around the neighborhood with new friends.

While the focus is here in Bay Ridge, we venture off to venues in other parts of Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn Museum and the Heights Players. Membership is NOT limited to only those living in Bay Ridge or even Brooklyn, so those \"out on the island\" or in one of the other boroughs are welcome, too!<\/p>\n<p>Similar to most meetups, \"The (Mostly) Bay Ridge Neighbors\" has a modest $1 organizing fee per event, payable to me at the start of an event, to offset the subscription cost of maintaining the meetup.<\/p>\n<p><em>Please note our No-Show Policy:<\/em> Because we've been kept waiting in lobbies, etc., for folks who didn't bother to change their rsvps, \"The (Mostly) Bay Ridge Neighbors\" &nbsp;has a \"no-show\"&nbsp;policy where any member who incurs ONE no-show with no explanatory emails to me will be permanently removed from our membership rolls and not be allowed to rsvp for any more of our events.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production.

More than just a drinking and dining-out group, this group is about learning and experiencing all that we consume--as it relates to culture, heritage, history and so much more!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>A few things to note:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>1) Events: All events will be designed to foster friendship.&nbsp; Dinners will not have large attendance lists, whereas happy hours will not be capped.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>2) Age: This group is intended for people in their 30's.&nbsp; I'd appreciate it if you respect that.&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>3) <\/span>In an effort to stem the amount of people who RSVP and fail to show up, I\u2019m going to implement the following policy for any person who RSVPs for the 1st time to an event that has a set reservation number and has not shown up to any past events:<\/p>\n<p>When you RSVP as a 1st Timer, I will send you a message to confirm that you will be attending the event. To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you\u2019ll remain on the RSVP list. In the event I do not hear back from you within those 48 hours, if there\u2019s a wait-list, I will remove you from the RSVP list to have someone from the wait-list take your spot.<\/p>\n<p>So please be sure you have your meetup settings allowing me as organizer to send you messages through meetup directly. <\/p>\n<p><span>4) Removal: If you\u2019re been a member of the group for six months and haven\u2019t RSVP\u2019d or attended a single event, then I reserve the right to remove you from the group. I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you\u2019re genuinely interested in giving it a shot \u2013 stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and\/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive). We also limit our membership to men who are ADULTS - we will take men in their early 30's, but our IDEAL range is really mid-to-late-30's, 40's and 50's.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/highres_432994493.jpeg","photo_id":432994493,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/600_432994493.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/thumb_432994493.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3053297,"name":"Lee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/highres_1996121.jpeg","photo_id":1996121,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/member_1996121.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/thumb_1996121.jpeg"}},"members":76,"name":"NYC Gay Jewish Single Men 30's - 50's","id":18293308,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Gay-Jewish-Single-Men-30s-50s","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Jewish Gay Single Men"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Matawan","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420303616000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"boating","name":"Boating","id":8595},{"urlkey":"pwc","name":"Personal Watercraft","id":9784},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"jetski","name":"Jetski","id":14085},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"waverunner","name":"waverunner","id":20528},{"urlkey":"waterskiing","name":"Waterskiing","id":24058},{"urlkey":"discover-scuba-diving","name":"Discover Scuba Diving","id":65795},{"urlkey":"watersports","name":"Watersports","id":66479},{"urlkey":"jet-ski","name":"Jet Ski","id":93917},{"urlkey":"jet-skis","name":"Jet Skis","id":170789},{"urlkey":"jetskiing","name":"Jetskiing","id":1390482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJPWC-Jet-Ski-Club\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>Water Fanatics unite... <b>yes you!<\/b> We love jet skis and all the fun associated with them.

We will each have an opportunity to sign up to teach a topic, lead a workshop, give a lecture or anything in between for up to 45 minutes.\u00a0This is a chance to try new things and have different experiences that we hope, in turn, will build community. As members of this group we\u00a0have one goal: to help grow our community of knowledge by sharing of ourselves and of course, have fun in the process! That means simply participating or signing up to lead us in a presentation.\u00a0<span>Is there anything you've always wanted to try but never did or a way you've wanted to push yourself, or something you love deeply that you wish you did more? Anything can be the theme of your presentation to the group<\/span><span>- from a juggling workshop to a lecture on evolution to a story of your travels to origami- what matters is that you bring something to the group that you love and are excited to share.
