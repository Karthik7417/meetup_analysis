I want to have us get together &amp; have a good time while getting to know others at my place. Any more details for this event will be posted ASAP but I wanted to get something up for the time being. At this time this is what I'm shooting for this year:<\/p> <p>Turkey &amp; Ham<\/p> <p>Sides:<br\/>Honey Cornbread<br\/>Collar Greens<br\/>Homemade Cranberry Raisin Sauce<br\/>Baked Beans<br\/>Sweet Potato Yams<br\/>a variation of Mac &amp; Cheese<br\/>Red Bliss Potato Salad...<\/p> <p>Dessert:<br\/>Assorted Cookies<br\/>Some type of dessert<\/p> <p>Drinks: Some form of Vodka, Bacardi Rum, Maker's Mark, Some type of Tequila, Mixers, Juices, Sodas, Coffee &amp; Teas<\/p> <p>All I ask is for you to cover for the food &amp; drink cost (at least $10) but look at it this way, it was a big success last year so I'm trying to make it a little bigger this year. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at anytime.<\/p> <p>Being as this event is a long event, you don't need to stay for the whole event. Mostly it's just you coming here, hang, eat &amp; socialize with other people. Feel free to come &amp; go as you please.<\/p> <p>I do ask for particular things:<\/p> <p>(1) Since I will be providing food &amp; drinks at this event, I ask for at least $10.00 to cover the cost.<\/p> <p>(2) Prepare to travel accordingly to &amp; from my place as I live in Queens now. Go to maps on Google &amp; Yahoo to get directions. You can also go to your IPhone or your GPS on your android if you have one.<\/p> <p>(3) Once you arrive I ask that you respect the neighbors place of residence &amp; not do anything that would bring unwanted attention.<\/p> <p>Directions:<\/p> <p>[A] If traveling on the (7) train &amp; walking:<\/p> <p>Take the train to the stop of 103rd Street-Corona Park. Walk downstairs to the street &amp; walk to 104th Street (there is a post office on the corner). Turn Right on that street &amp; you will walk a few blocks (in the same direction of traffic). You will run into Corona Avenue. Turn Left &amp; walk on that road until you hit 108th Street. Turn Right &amp; walk to 53rd Avenue. Turn Right &amp; my building is the 1st one on the right side with the balconies.<\/p> <p>[B] If traveling on the (7) Train &amp; Q23 Bus:<\/p> <p>Take the train to the stop of 103rd Street-Corona Park. Walk downstairs to the street &amp; walk to 104th Street. Turn Left &amp; walk a half-block until you see the Q23 Bus Stop. Take the bus &amp; stay on it until you get to the stop of 108th Street &amp; 53rd Avenue. Get off. Turn &amp; walk to 53rd Street. My building is the 1st one on the right side with the balconies.<\/p> <p>[C] If traveling on the (E)(F)(M)(R) train &amp; Q58 Bus:<\/p> <p>Take one of these trains to 71st Avenue-Forest Hills in Queens. get out &amp; transfer to a Q58 Bus. Ride that bus (about 15 minutes) until you get to the stop of 108th Street &amp; Martense Avenue. Get off &amp; Walk to 53rd Avenue. Cross the street &amp; look for a set of buildings with balconies. I'm in the one on the right side (also look for the number on the door).<\/p> <p>I will be combining this with multiple\u00a0groups so <b>if you rsvp, do it on only one list<\/b> (it makes things easier for guest list purpose).<\/p> <p>Enjoy your day today &amp; I'll see you in November.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCGrindhouse\/events\/219241820\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":36000000,"name":"Thanksgiving Grindhouse!","id":"219241820","time":1448128800000,"updated":1448211603000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297642164000,"name":"NYC GRINDHOUSE","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1783262,"urlname":"NYCGrindhouse","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Sick n'twisted fkers!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Websphere","address_1":"Conference Line","name":"Online","lon":0,"id":19557102,"state":"CA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.692301332951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446392777000,"fee":{"amount":35,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Reviewing &amp; Analyzing Actual Investment Opportunities and Markets<\/p> <p>All properties presented are available for purchase that day!<\/p> <p><b>Cost: <\/b><br\/>$25 by 11\/15\/15<br\/>$35 after 11\/16\/15<br\/>Fee includes participation in the entire day.<br\/><b>Register: simplydoitacademy.com\/TakeAction<\/b><\/p> <p><b> Join us for a day full of action!<\/b><\/p> <p>We will reveal hand-picked properties from select markets, meet the realtors and property management teams in-person, review and analyze the properties, and provide you with tools to take action by the end of the day.<\/p> <p>Properties are available for purchase based on first come, first serve!<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t miss your opportunity to ask questions and get live support with the purchase process.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/8kMuoUriRZI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/8kMuoUriRZI<\/a><\/p> <p>Who Should Attend<\/p> <p>\u2022 Beginner investors<\/p> <p>\u2022 Experienced investors<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who want to consider out-of-state<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who have many concerns but not sure how to tackle them<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who are not sure how to get started<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who want to flip properties<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who want to generate passive income from rentals<\/p> <p>\u2022 Investors who have many questions but not sure where to find answers<\/p> <p><b> Investment Opportunities Presentations<\/b><\/p> <p>Dallas Rentals.

In the first round of voting, each individual may vote for as many questions as they like. The top three will then go to a second round, where each individual may vote just once.<\/p> <p>4) The question with the most votes is then discussed.

So how about a book written not by just any woman, but by the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature?<\/p> <p>Pearl S. Buck was the daughter of Christian missionaries in China. She spent the majority of her first 40 years of life in China--her first language was Chinese and even as an adult she thought in Chinese and translated these thoughts into English when she began writing and publishing stories. Pearl was largely responsible for bringing an understanding of Chinese culture to America and was a huge advocate of women and minority rights and the adoption of Asian children by American families.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>The Good Earth<\/i> was published in 1931 and awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1932. The best-selling novel in the United States in both 1931 and 1932 was an influential factor in Buck's winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938. The novel, which dramatizes family life in a Chinese village before World War I, has been a steady favorite ever since. It was included in Life Magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924\u20131944. In 2004, the book was returned to the bestseller list when chosen by the television host Oprah Winfrey for Oprah's Book Club. The novel helped prepare Americans of the 1930s to consider Chinese as allies in the coming war with Japan. It has been adapted into both a Broadway play in 1932 and a movie in 1937.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Even though Buck was white, Chinese readers often comment on how authentic her description of the Chinese experience was. Though she spent the last several decades of her life in America, she was often quoted as saying she had never left China.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This book is a manageable 350 pages long. After this I will make a point of selecting books no longer than 200 pages so people aren't overwhelmed during the holidays. If the weather holds out we'll meet in Central Park, if not, we'll meet in my apartment in Washington Heights.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/225040333\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Pearl S.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to another's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.<\/p> <p>Article link:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?q=Putting+the+altruism+back+into+altruism:+the+evolution+of+empathy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQgQMwAGoVChMI-LmGuOiDyQIVhqA-Ch2KcgmO\"><a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?q=Putting+the+altruism+back+into+altruism:+the+evolution+of+empathy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQgQMwAGoVChMI-LmGuOiDyQIVhqA-Ch2KcgmO\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?q=Putting+the+altruism+back+into+altruism:+the+evolution+of+empathy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQgQMwAGoVChMI-LmGuOiDyQIVhqA-Ch2KcgmO<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Idealists-NF-INFP-INFJ-ENFP-ENFJ-meetup-Age-30\/events\/226654454\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"NF\/Idealists Nerd-out; Academic Journal Article, Reading & Discussion","id":"226654454","time":1448132400000,"updated":1448202145000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1419295611000,"name":"NYC Idealists - NF (INFP, INFJ, ENFP, ENFJ) meetup (Age 30+)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18269249,"urlname":"NYC-Idealists-NF-INFP-INFJ-ENFP-ENFJ-meetup-Age-30","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"iNtuitive Feelers (NF)"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11021","country":"us","city":"Great Neck","address_1":"475 Northern Boulevard Suite 11","name":"Reddy-Care  ","lon":-73.721901,"id":6705912,"state":"NY","lat":40.779873,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.2097787857,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445985229000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>GET REDDY-CARE FOR THE RIGHT CARE<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i><a href=\"http:\/\/reddycare.net\/\">website<\/a><br\/><\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Laughter-Yoga-of-Long-Island\/events\/226354499\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":3600000,"name":"Group Laughter - Reduce Stress-Boost Energy-Feel Great!","id":"226354499","time":1448132400000,"updated":1448141099000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334448887000,"name":"Laughter Yoga of Long Island","group_lon":-73.7300033569,"id":3670542,"urlname":"Laughter-Yoga-of-Long-Island","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Laughing Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Garden City","address_1":"630 Stewart Ave","name":"Hurricane Grill & Wings","lon":-73.610344,"id":23534736,"state":"NY","lat":40.731941,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":19.954662323,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445811579000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/7\/b\/600_443052923.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/8\/3\/600_443052931.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Hi All,<\/p> <p>We had a great meeting at our new venue and will be repeating it for Nov.

New information is bombarding us daily, demanding from each of us to take a stance in order to secure our future. Is climate change really threatening us? Are vaccines more harmful than good?

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

What makes these groups unique is they only have one Entrepreneur representing a line of product or service. As a member of these groups, you will get to network with other professionals on a monthly basis where you will get to know them and their business or service personally. In each meeting, members can self-introduce, promote their products and services. Your products or services may not be something most ABRN members need or are looking for, but getting to know you, builds trust and friendships. As they run across people who are looking for what you offer, they will refer your products or services to those in need. ABRN promote professionals through word of mouth referral that enables them to develop long term business networks.<\/p> <p><b>FREE NETWORKING EVENTS<\/b><\/p> <p>ABRN offers free events to its general membership from time to time. There is a chance to mingle with other professionals and exchange information\u2019s. A great networking tool!<\/p> <p>A: - ABRN welcomes your suggestions and leadership<\/p> <p>B: - Bring lots of business cards. Not only will you be giving your cards to those at your table and others you meet during the event, we also have a card table with cards for everyone attending, so you can select those that interest you or that you think would be a service or product you could recommend to someone you know. The cards are placed in categories. Your business may be applicable to multiple categories so be sure to bring enough. You can take your unused cards with you at the end of the event.<\/p> <p><b>C: -<\/b> 2- Next be prepared to give a one minute presentation (Promote Yourself\u00ae). The best structure to use is this. Your name, your business and location. How long you have been in business. What is your product or service? This event should be about building relationships and getting lots of future referrals, NOT making a quick one time sale. Let your personality come through the presentation.<\/p> <p>D: - 3- Network, Free Network, Free Network! Remember, this event is not about making a sale, so relax!! Just be yourself and get to know others with the intent of working together and supporting our local colleagues by referring them to your friends and customers when they are looking for that service. They will be doing the same for you!<\/p> <p>E:- Attend an ABRN meeting! Remember, the ABRN does not make any money from these events, so this is not a sales pitch. The absolute best way to get referrals is from someone who is familiar with you! The more your companies name and product is heard, the faster it will come to mind when someone says they are looking for what you do. Building an identity to your company is priceless.<\/p> <p>F:- Make referrals!!! Get Business!!!!

Tanji was a GCF partner who suffered from a severe mental health challenge. At times she experienced great success and others she succumbed to the pain. Sadly we lost Tanji and her son to a house fire in 2013. We celebrate her warrior spirit by honoring three women, who despite facing personal challenges, have met their obstacles as opportunities. Funds raised from this event go to support the Georgia King Housing Development in Newark, NJ. For the past four years, GrassROOTS give thanks by providing needy residents with a 20lbs turkey and a 5lbs bag of fruit and vegetables.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to raise $30,000 in support of GrassROOTS\u2019 wellness programs for residents of Georgia King Village and throughout New Jersey.<\/p> <p>MYX &amp; Mingle cocktail hour with music by Enoch Smith Jr. Jazz Band from 7-8pm.<\/p> <p>Tribute to the late GrassROOTS supporter Tanji Dewberry and two Wellness Warriors: Kym Gilchrist and Sonia Fergus, cancer survivors<\/p> <p>Music by Kindred The Family Soul and DJ Scotty Nevers<\/p> <p>grassrootscommunityfoundation.org\/events\/event\/2015-grassroots-give-thanks-cocktail-fundraiser\/<\/p> <p><br\/>oiiiii<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Newark-Social\/events\/226693727\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":14400000,"name":"Cocktail Fundraiser&Tribute hosted by Mona Scott performance Kindred&Family Soul","id":"226693727","time":1448150400000,"updated":1448166183000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1275532119000,"name":"Newark Social","group_lon":-74.1699981689,"id":1655201,"urlname":"Newark-Social","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"96 Layfayette Street","name":"Santos Party House","lon":-74.001534,"id":24166499,"state":"NY","lat":40.717705,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.31648683548,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445527671000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This looks like a fun night in the city - it is labeled as pop erotica so not for the conservative person! \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Sweet Spot is a high energy, heart-pounding, fist pumping, laugh-out-loud pop erotica event performing in\u00a030+ cities and counting across the US and Canada!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/9\/0\/600_443321872.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-sweet-spot-nyc-red-light-special-tickets-18655948444?aff=NYCPartners&amp;afu=133070914251\">Tickets HERE<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-sweet-spot-charlotte-red-light-special-9pm-tickets-18316687706?aff=CharlottePartners&amp;afu=133070914251\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>\u200bThis sensational theater production features the world's best performance poets, live body art, burlesque, fashion, musicians, top 40 DJs, comedians and more.

Slava (\"Rostislav Persion\") is already there, he's the guy with the beard. The reservation is under \"Edwin\"<\/p> <p>If anybody needs to text me, my number is[masked]<\/p> <p>I need to go pick up Hanneh, which I MIGHT do at this point, but the thing is we'd need to stop by her place so she can put boots on.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been wanting to do a campfire night for a long time, and thought I'd try to fit it in before Thanksgiving, after which it's apparently to cold for people to brave. The little fire circle at the Closter Nature Center is the only fire pit I know of locally that isn't barred from being used; apparently it's a huge liability and the insurance is expensive and even the boy scouts barely do camp fires anymore, so it's lucky that the one place left is so close by.<\/p> <p>We'll start by eating dinner at Brady's Fox Hunt Inn, which I have not yet been to but I hear is very good.<\/p> <p>Later we will head down the road to Closter to the Closter Nature Center for the campfire.<\/p> <p>I will be asking for $14 from everyone. Mark (runs the Closter Nature Center) said the event cost at the CNC is $75, so I figure $9 per person as a donation would end up covering it. Obviously, the more people show, the smaller the split would be, but I encourage everyone that we try to leave more for Mark than the bare minimum of $75. The other $4 will go to firewood and material, and the last $1 to the meetup group. I can make receipts so you can write it off as a donation at tax time, though I guess only for the $9 going to the Closter Nature Center.<\/p> <p>The Nature Center is located at 154 Ruckman Road, Closter, NJ. There is some parking right there. If that parking lot gets full, there is parking across the pond, behind the other log cabin. To get to that parking space, you turn onto Irving Ave from Piermont Road, drive to the dead end of Irving where it's gravel road, and make a right. The turn onto Irving is right across the street from the driveway exit of Sear steakhouse. If we need even more parking, that dead end of Irving, and some of Ruckman Road can also serve as parking. Ruckman Road is a main road with limited shoulder space, but when the Nature Center's held events, I've seen people park there. Any such parking is at your own risk.<\/p> <p>The campfire is located at:<br\/>Once you enter the main entrance to the Nature Center (Ruckman Road), and park at that parking space, if you look across the pond, sort of along the direction of Ruckman road, the campfire is on that other side. There is a path circling the entire pond so you can get there. The parking on that other side of the pond, behind the other log cabin, that you get to from Irving ave, is much closer to the campfire, and I'm going to be parking there.<\/p> <p>Now, I had a whole picture thingy made up, but I'm not sure if I can post pics or edit a meetup later once I've posted in this group, so I'll just link to an old meetup where walking directions with pictures are provided.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tri-State-20-30-Somethings\/events\/219686954\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tri-State-20-30-Somethings\/events\/219686954\/<\/a><\/p> <p>I don't know how to change the max RSVP on this group either, otherwise I would, because we don't want like 20 people trying to fit around a campfire.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthernNewJerseyFriends\/events\/226849686\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Campfire Night","id":"226849686","time":1448152200000,"updated":1448163600000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346031316000,"name":"Northern New Jersey 20s-40s Friends","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":4646572,"urlname":"NorthernNewJerseyFriends","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Northern New Jersey Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11375","country":"us","city":"Queens","address_1":"106-11 Continental Avenue","name":"Forest Hills Station House Bar","lon":-73.845222,"id":14161732,"state":"Ne","lat":40.719494,"repinned":false},"headcount":14,"distance":7.88355779648,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446944001000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":4.82999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us Saturday night for a bar crawl in Forest Hills.

In 2012, the trio's second CD \"Red Apples and Gold,\" rose to #5 on the Folk DJ charts in September and to #12 on the national Roots Music Report radio charts in October, charting at #76 in the year-end Top 100 Albums.

He has shared the stage with folk royalty Richie Havens, Lucinda Williams, Jessie Colin Young, John Hammond Jr., Lucy Kaplansky, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Ron has performed at such well-known venues as Gerdes Folk City, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, The Bottom Line and numerous other U.S. and international venues. A sought-after studio musician, he is currently working on his own soon to be released 6th CD, \"Late Bloomer.\" Aided by outstanding dexterity on an old Martin, and a slightly raspy baritone, Ron's music touches on universal themes that can at once entertain, inspire and often move some feet.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's the buzz on Ron Renninger ...<\/p> <p>\"Ron Renninger more than held his own with well crafted, well sung and superbly played original compositions. An unexpected treat.\"<\/p> <p>THE NEW YORK TIMES<\/p> <p>\"Simple instrumentation keeps his voice and nimble finger picking in the forefront. Renninger seems to be an artist whose fuse and muse still burn bright.\"<\/p> <p>PERFORMING SONGWRITER Magazine<\/p> <p>\"He truly is a great Singer, Songwriter and Guitarist.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226605055\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpbdc","time":1448200800000,"updated":1448212472000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":5.09583377838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1370538278000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pickupsoccer-202\/events\/226793965\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"GAME","id":"dnkzcgytpbdc","time":1448200800000,"updated":1448212483000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1214915969000,"name":"Bay Ridge FC Get back in shape pickup soccer","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1206990,"urlname":"pickupsoccer-202","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07450","country":"us","city":"Ridgewood","address_1":"East Ridgewood Ave","name":"Saddle River County Park- Wild Duck Pond, Ridgewood NJ","lon":-74.106369,"id":1415741,"state":"NJ","lat":40.97683,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.8448905945,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447536121000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This run starts at the \"Wild Duck Pond\" area of the Saddle River County Park in Ridgewood.

Walnut Mountain is the second highest mountain in Sullivan County. The Park can be accessed from either the William E. Pearson entrance at the end of Walnut Mountain Road (off Route 55, west of the village) or the Lake Street entrance (intersection of West Lake Street and Eagle Drive). This Park was formally the property of the Walnut Mountain Hotel, which was located at the top face of the mountain. Foundations and the hotels fireplace can still be seen along the walking trails. The land was purchased by the Town of Liberty in the 1960\u2019s and has been developed into a park. There are approximately 13 miles of Hiking and Mountain Biking Trails winding throughout the park which are considered some of the best in the area. Much of the terrain is steep which allows for a wonderful experience for the advanced mountain bikers, but yet, gradual enough grades for the less experienced bikers and hikers. The views throughout the park are breathtaking.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/f\/d\/600_444292733.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>DIRECTIONS TO PARK:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>William E.

This fascia restriction can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention. \u00a0In addition, increased respiratory control and focus have been reported by students.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian\/chakras pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is emphasized to sensations in the body that are grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into vigorous strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

For those in the mood for a throwback to the doomed romanticism of mid'60s art films, this feels like about as sincere an homage as anyone could produce.<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.indiewire.com\/theplaylist\/afi-review-by-the-sea-by-angelina-jolie-pitt-co-starring-brad-pitt-and-melanie-laurent-20151106\">Katie Walsh<\/a>\u00a0Nov 6,[masked]Jolie Pitt\u2019s insistence on creating a piece that reflects the harsh inner state of a person suffering to understand herself as a wife and as a woman in the world is commendable, and fascinating in her growth as a filmmaker.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2015\/11\/review-by-the-sea-is-uneven-but-surprises.html\">New York Magazine (Vulture)<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2015\/11\/review-by-the-sea-is-uneven-but-surprises.html\">Bilge Ebiri<\/a>Nov 12,[masked]You keep watching not just because she and Brad and the Mediterranean are beautiful, but also because small, surprising details start to take on great importance.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/entertainment\/movies\/la-et-mn-by-the-sea-review-20151113-story.html\">Los Angeles Time<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/entertainment\/movies\/la-et-mn-by-the-sea-review-20151113-story.html\">Rebecca Keegan<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nov 12,[masked]As a writer, Jolie Pitt is better at ideas than dialogue, much of which is leaden here.

More interestingly, the movie, which Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote and directed, is a knowing or at least a ticklishly amusing demonstration of celebrity and its relay of gazes from one of the most looked-at women in the world.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slantmagazine.com\/film\/review\/by-the-sea\">Slant Magazine<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slantmagazine.com\/film\/review\/by-the-sea\">Christopher Gray<\/a>\u00a0Nov 11,[masked]If it stumbles when it seeks our sympathy, it thrives when it's exploiting our fascination with the surface of things, and all that's unknowable underneath.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Thinkers-Intellectuals-and-Skeptics-Social-Club\/events\/226833631\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"SUNDAY 11\/22 BRUNCH@FOOLS GOLD & MOVIE: \"BY THE SEA\" @SUNSHINE CINEMA","id":"226833631","time":1448211600000,"updated":1448224451000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1441646089000,"name":"NYC Thinkers,Intellectuals and Skeptics 35+","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18908133,"urlname":"NYC-Thinkers-Intellectuals-and-Skeptics-Social-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Individualists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"355 37th Street","name":"P.S. 371 LILLIAN L.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game.

Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $25 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/25.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(Balance due at time of shoot: $55, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.)<\/p> <p>(Non-Commercial Release provided onsite or PDF version to email registered upon check-in.)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Models:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>(Courtesy of Jeff Black Models) Modeling page links will be updated as I receive them.<\/p> <p><b>Diana Dee:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/6\/2\/600_443965442.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/b\/600_443965467.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/8\/f\/600_443965487.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/9\/4\/600_443965492.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Jessica Skinner: <\/b>(Photos provided by booking agent.)\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/d\/3\/600_443965811.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/d\/c\/600_443965564.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/5\/2\/600_444394898.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/4\/9\/600_444394889.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Policy and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>One-on-One:<\/b>\u00a0The model will be available for one half hour one on one shoot after the first two hours in the Meetup. If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b> - We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/226631334\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":10800000,"name":"Glamour and Speed Bike Shoot - w\/Diana & Jessica - Nov. 22nd","id":"226631334","time":1448218800000,"updated":1448246385000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"226 West 44th Street between 7th and 8th Avenue","name":"Discovery Times Square","lon":-73.97821,"id":23930275,"state":"NY","lat":40.666958,"repinned":false},"headcount":4,"distance":5.78274679184,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446949886000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/d\/b\/600_443936795.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Featuring 70 hand-crafted costumes from the first six blockbuster Star Wars\u2122 films, this exhibition reveals the artists\u2019 creative process\u2014and uncovers the connection between character and costume.

The costumes shaped the identities of these now famous characters, from the menacing black mask of Darth Vader and the gilded suit of C-3PO, to the lavish royal gowns of Queen Amidala and a bikini worn by Princess Leia when enslaved by Jabba the Hutt.

There is also a $15 minimum order for food. Having said that...this should be FUN!<\/p> <p>Can't wait to see you there!<\/p> <p>Christina<\/p> <p>***Book Synopsis***<br\/>In 2011, Marie Claire magazine published a profile of Janet Mock in which she stepped forward for the first time as a trans woman. Those twenty-three hundred words were life-altering for the People.com editor, turning her into an influential and outspoken public figure and a desperately needed voice for an often voiceless community. In these pages, she offers a bold and inspiring perspective on being young, multicultural, economically challenged, and transgender in America. Welcomed into the world as her parents\u2019 firstborn son, Mock decided early on that she would be her own person\u2014no matter what. She struggled as the smart, determined child in a deeply loving yet ill-equipped family that lacked the money, education, and resources necessary to help her thrive. Mock navigated her way through her teen years without parental guidance, but luckily, with the support of a few close friends and mentors, she emerged much stronger, ready to take on\u2014and maybe even change\u2014the world. This powerful memoir follows Mock\u2019s quest for identity, from an early, unwavering conviction about her gender to a turbulent adolescence in Honolulu that saw her transitioning during the tender years of high school, self-medicating with hormones at fifteen, and flying across the world alone for sex reassignment surgery at just eighteen. With unflinching honesty, Mock uses her own experience to impart vital insight about the unique challenges and vulnerabilities of trans youth and brave girls like herself. Despite the hurdles, Mock received a scholarship to college and moved to New York City, where she earned a master\u2019s degree, enjoyed the success of an enviable career, and told no one about her past.

The commentaries for each chapter, along with the appendix, are optional and will not be discussed.<\/p> <p>At the end of this meetup, we'll also discuss whether or not we'll have a meetup in December, and also consider some possible themes to cover for our group in 2016.<\/p> <p>Below are some study questions to help guide your reading of the rest of Becker's book. As usual, please try your best to answer these questions for yourself as you do the reading. We'll be discussing some, but not all, of them during the meetup. Also highlight any passages or concepts you'd like to bring up for discussion as well.<\/p> <p><b>Study questions<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Rest of Chapter 6<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0What is the argument for virtue as the perfection of agency?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Does the above argument apply to everyone?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Should healthy human agents all be alike?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 How should Stoics deal with non-Stoics of a different psychology according to Becker?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Does Becker fully believe that virtue is all-or-nothing?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0What argument does Becker give for the all-or-nothing nature of virtue?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 What argument does he give that virtue is the only good?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 What does Becker mean by calling virtue \"incommensurable\"?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i>Chapter 7<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 What is the ideal frame of reference to develop one's agency?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Describe Becker's version of \"a complete life.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0How does Becker reframe the ancient Stoic idea of preferred indifferents?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Are narratives and life-plans necessary for Stoic practice?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Becker states that there's evidence that both healthy and unhealthy primal traits become fixed in childhood and that from this \"some important norms for moral education follow rather directly.\" What do you think these norms are?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 Becker claims that \"being overcome by emotion is not more problematic for a stoic than being overcome by sleep\" and that it's the \"ability to stop feelings (or break attachments) suddenly, when practical intelligence calls for it\" that matters.

When Alice (MARLO THOMAS) notices her beloved husband Bill (GREG MULLAVEY) has returned home on edge after a tennis match with their son, she grows suspicious and springs into action. Determined to piece together the puzzle, she invites her son, Bill, Jr. (GEORGE MERRICK), and daughter-in-law, Jane (KATE WETHERHEAD), over for drinks and dessert. Sidesplitting chaos ensues as Alice digs for the truth, resulting in even more honesty than anyone expected. Shattering and hilarious, Clever Little Lies is a story of long-term love and marriage for better and for worse.<\/p> <p><b>Early Bird Offer: Save Over 35% \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>TICKETS ONLY<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$49*\u00a0<\/b>(reg. $79) for performances Mon-Thu<\/p> <p><b>$59*\u00a0<\/b>(reg. $89) for performances Fri-Sun<\/p> <p><b>3 WAYS TO BUY YOUR TICKETS<\/b><b>:<\/b><\/p> <p>ONLINE:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pr4.netatlantic.com\/t\/3630359\/58812252\/187815\/14\/\">Click Here<\/a>\u00a0&amp; enter code:\u00a0<b>CVLSP56<\/b><\/p> <p>BY PHONE: Call\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pr4.netatlantic.com\/t\/3630359\/58812252\/187816\/15\/\">Cleverlittlelies.com<\/a><\/p> <p>$20.

Music is organized sound that has potent emotional effects and stimulates memories, associations, and highly developed\u00a0 psychological states with clear impact on our healing systems.\"<\/p> <p>\u00a0Toning* in your own voice is a very powerful tool for self-healing, relaxation, personal growth, opening creativity, and helping to balance life experiences.Toning is the elongation of a note or tone using breath and voice to assist you to get still enough to meditate.<br\/>It is great.....<br\/>\u2022 If you have a difficult time getting still enough to meditate;<br\/>\u2022 If you desire higher states of consciousness;<br\/>\u2022 If your communication energy center seems blocked;<br\/>\u2022 If you breathe too shallowly;<br\/>\u2022 If you need immediate grief or stress relief;<br\/>\u2022 If you're depressed;<br\/>\u2022 If you need more confidence or zest;<br\/>\u2022 If you have trouble listening, focusing or being in the moment<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at the next scheduled meet-up!Please e-mail me at [masked] if you have any questions or concerns.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-and-Silence-Meditation\/events\/226783265\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Sound and Silence Meditation","id":"dnccvhytpbdc","time":1448236800000,"updated":1448248934000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1298719062000,"name":"Sound and Silence Meditation","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1789899,"urlname":"Sound-and-Silence-Meditation","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"111 4th Ave ","name":"Jerry's International Palette Shop","lon":-73.9897,"id":23886233,"state":"NY","lat":40.732353,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":30,"distance":1.222032547,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1433734487000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Sunday Night Figure Drink and Draw (Nude)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>A joint production of the Teaching Studios of Art\u00ae and Jerry's Palette Shop<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><i>The magic is back<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>After a year long hiatus, we are bringing back our famous Drink and Draw event.

We are currently meeting on Mondays and Friday approximately noon until 4:30 at a Mamaroneck forest location and Wednesdays at 9:30. \u00a0You can join for one or more of these days - whatever works best for you.<\/p> <p>Forest play school is a nature-based option that is held exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather (rain, snow, cold), children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a designated outdoor forest environment where the children and parents meet each week all year. This play school is play-based and parent supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. The structure of the group is inspired by the Forest Kindergarten program, which is very popular in other parts of the world and is gradually spreading throughout the US. Cutting-edge research is showing that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development - physical, emotional, and spiritual. \u00a0The children are engaging in very important \"work\" through playing and navigating relationships in play school.<\/p> <p>Each parent practices gentle guidance, patience and positive role modeling for all of the children while helping them navigate sometimes complex social situations. \u00a0Our goal is for each child to feel safe and respected by the mothers and their peers while at play school. \u00a0Each week the parents read a parenting article on positive\/gentle parenting in order to discuss together.<\/p> <p>The children feel at home in our forest location. \u00a0We prepare ourselves appropriately for the day's weather, practically this means layers, extra clothes, and sun\/wind\/rain\/snow protection. The children find joy and amusement from the sticks, stones, bugs and plants around them, therefore they don't need to bring toys to play school. A spirit of open exploration and creativity permeates the group. \u00a0Each parent brings their own healthy food for their children (either lunch or snacks, depending on the family\u2019s needs). \u00a0Most days include some songs and read-alouds.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here is what some of the parents are saying:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u201cWe love our time in the forest. \u00a0Being in the forest feels therapeutic for me and the kids. \u00a0The forest is our little sanctuary where time stands still. \u00a0The children feel deeply connected to the forest - they uncover the details of their forest home more and more each week and watch the seasons unfold right before their eyes. \u00a0There is something so magical about having no toys and watching them play so creatively. \u00a0This type of play is so ideal for problem solving, critical thinking and decision making. And the physical environment is so wonderful for gross and fine motor skill development- it provides so much more than a playground ever could!\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SouthernWestchesterAttachmentParents\/events\/226839688\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Rock Climbers - Forest Play School","id":"fnbkmlytpbfc","time":1448299800000,"updated":1448312373000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1327613643000,"name":"Southern Westchester Attachment Parenting Group","group_lon":-73.7799987793,"id":3174552,"urlname":"SouthernWestchesterAttachmentParents","group_lat":41.0299987793,"who":"AP Parents"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hastings-on-Hudson","address_1":"68 Prince Street","name":"Hilary's house","lon":-73.871872,"id":23556477,"state":"NY","lat":40.985661,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.448551178,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421091794000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join other new mamas at these meetings tailored to moms of newborns up to 12 months old.

And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are.

It is based on the belief that we have two thoughts systems, one based on fear and separation from the Divine and another one based on love and oneness with the Divine. The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

This approach introduces some interesting challenges, like automatically detecting and implementing optimal data layouts for different ML models. For instance, linear regressions, logistic regressions, GBM's, and kNN all require different data layouts to perform well at scale, but architecting these layouts by hand is non-trivial and doesn't enable flexibility as datasets change and scale.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Ronen Hilewicz <\/b>(VP of Engineering)\u00a0started engineering professionally at age 18 in the Israeli military, working on SIGINT systems.

In this biweekly series, we\u2019ll explore classic introductory Buddhist books.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/226188379\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"COSI -Master of the Rose Cross: War, A Condition of the Mind","id":"fpbtflytpbfc","time":1448321400000,"updated":1448333347000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"18 W.

Charts and graphs display data in ways that benefit retention and comprehension. How can we build graphic representations of information that creates a better experience for our users? What are things we should worry about when designing and implementing data visualizations in our web applications? These graphs are innately visual, but it's our responsibility to make them accessible as well. In this talk, Amanda takes a look at how we as designers and developers can help our users understand our graphs better, easier and faster.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b>:<\/p> <p>\u00a0Amanda is the lead UX developer at DockYard, a design-driven software consultancy based out of Boston, MA. She comes from a visual background having graduated with a BFA in painting, but another part of her brain fell in love with CSS. Finding better user experience solutions by balancing designers' and developers' priorities fascinates her. She is always trying to improve the designer-developer relationship. Passionate about accessibility and CSS architecture, Amanda is also a co-organizer of the Boston CSS MeetUp and a teacher for Girl Develop It.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Talk 2:<\/p> <p>Karl Sluis<\/p> <p><b>Talk Title: <\/b>What I Wish I Knew Two Years Ago: A Designer's Guide to D3<\/p> <p><b>Talk Description:<\/b><\/p> <p>Let's face it \u2014 D3 is as powerful as it is arcane.

True to his love of the traditional photograph, Dan uses digital technology to build images that still look and feel like real photographs, not like something from a graphic designer\u2019s portfolio. Melding his unique vision with mastery of both the wet and digital darkrooms, his platinum prints are now included in many museum and private collections. Then, again, when the smartphone became of age, Dan was first on the scene boldly going where no photographer had gone before\u2014iPhoneography!

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

To compound this problem, what it means to be a manager in the 21st century is dramatically changing with the typical boss-subordinate management style proving to be inefficient and destructive to organizational culture.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.
