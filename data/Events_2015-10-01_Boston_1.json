When you pretend to laugh or act happy, your body produces the same happiness chemicals and you get all the same health benefits of laughing.

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

For the past 20 years Jansen has been creating and exhibiting his dramatic, kinetic Strandbeests. He has appeared on multiple TED Talks, been the subject of a profile in The New Yorker and shown his work in Asia, Europe and now the United States. A trained physicist, Jansen\u2019s Strandbeests bridge the gap between art and engineering, attracting a broad array of followers: from engineers, biologists, and philosophers, to environmentalists, writers and makers.<\/p> <p>Designer Neri Oxman is the Sony Corporation Career Development and associate professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab, where she founded and directs the Mediated Matter research group. Her group explores how digital design and fabrication technologies mediate between matter and environment to radically transform the design and construction of objects, buildings, and systems. Oxman coined the term \u201cmaterial ecology\u201d to describe the study and design of products and processes integrating environmentally aware, computational, form-generation processes and digital fabrication. Her goal is to enhance the relationship between the built and the natural environments by employing design principles inspired by nature, and implementing them in the invention of novel digital design technologies. Areas of application include product and architectural design, as well as digital fabrication and construction. Oxman was named to ICON's list of the 20 most influential architects to shape our future (2009), and was selected as one of the \u201c100 most creative people\u201d by Fast Company (2009). In 2008, she was named \"Revolutionary Mind\" by SEED Magazine. Her work has been exhibited at MoMA (NYC) and is part of the museum's permanent collection. In 2012 the Centre Georges Pompidou Museum (Paris, France) acquired her works for its permanent collection. Other exhibitions include the Smithsonian Institute (Washington, DC), Museum of Science (Boston, MA), FRAC Collection (Orleans, France), and the 2010 Beijing Biennale.

Tournament please just go through our Join Page:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join\"><a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/TennisNorthEast.com\/join<\/a><\/a><br\/>***********************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>How does the TennisNorthEast Tournament Work?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Every Match Counts *NEW* for 2015<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Tennis Tournament Basic Concept<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments are a single elimination format with a consolation bracket. Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNorthEast staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNorthEast staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The cost will be $19.95 per tournament except for the inaugural tournament which will be $19.95.<\/p> <p><b>Join Today!!<\/b><\/p> <p>So <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/join\">Join Today<\/a> and we'd be happy to get you enrolled into the next tournament.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Metro-Boston-Tennis-League\/events\/224100695\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Sept.

During this talk, we\u2019ll highlight how we are leveraging user experience design in an educational context for Project RAISE (Reclaiming Access to Inquiry Science Education for Incarcerated Students). CAST, Inc. has traditionally used a research-based framework for curriculum development to design education tools that meet the widest range of learner needs. Recently, we\u2019ve begun to borrow and integrate UXD methods to enhance and evolve our processes and products. Through workarounds and creative research strategies, we are developing an ecology curriculum that is flexible enough to address the unique needs of students and teachers, while at the same time accommodating institutional, educational, and technological constraints.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Kim.<\/b>\u00a0Kim Ducharme is Director of Design at\u00a0<b>CAST, Inc.<\/b>, an educational research and development organization, and formerly headed up interactive design at\u00a0<b>WGBH<\/b>. At CAST, Kim heads up design strategy and user experience for the development of interactive learning environments and tools that expand learning opportunities for all individuals through Universal Design for Learning. She is committed to harnessing the power of design to tackle the educational challenges of our time.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Christina.<\/b>\u00a0As an instructional designer and research associate at\u00a0<b>CAST, Inc.<\/b>, Christina Bosch's work blends UX and Universal Design for Learning strategies with pedagogical expertise from special education and arts integration teaching experiences.

And who needs it anyway? User interface design strives to make an app so intuitive that people can perform the desired task without thinking about the user interface with which they are interacting. This seamless experience is the goal, but it is difficult to attain for all use cases, all personas, and all screen sizes. Assistance still needs to be available when the user needs it, and not be in the way when the user doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ll look at some successful and some less than successful attempts at user assistance and discuss ways to implement user assistance in mobile apps. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Deborah<\/b>.\u00a0Deborah designs user assistance content for <b>Sonos, Inc.<\/b>, a leader in wireless music systems.

The recently released RoboVM library, for example, lets you build native iOS applications in Java, and indeed Clojure. Meanwhile, many approaches now exist for building native mobile applications with JavaScript. These tools enable development of cross-platform native apps on iOS\/Android\/web with nearly all code shared. I'll discuss the basics of both Java- and JavaScript-based strategies, our experience with the pros and cons of each at Figly, and how we ended up using ClojureScript and React Native.<\/p> <p><b>Chris Vermilion<\/b> is a software developer and academia-dropout ex-physicist currently working as an engineer at Figly, a startup developing a platform for building cross-platform enterprise apps. Before that he co-founded Roobiq, a mobile CRM startup.<\/p> <p>Future meeting ideas will be discussed over the meetup board and in our Google discussion group: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/boston-clojure\"><a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/boston-clojure\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/boston-clojure<\/a><\/a> .<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Near the Kendall Square T stop","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Clojure-Group\/events\/223426488\/","yes_rsvp_count":33,"name":"Cross-platform native app development with Clojure\/ClojureScript","id":"ddqvjjytmbnb","time":1441924200000,"updated":1441995732000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294421299000,"name":"Boston Clojure Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1761322,"urlname":"Boston-Clojure-Group","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01923","country":"us","city":"Danvers","address_1":"46 Cherry Street","name":"All Saints Episcopal Church of the North Shore (Formally Calvary Church)","lon":-70.94046,"id":10894392,"state":"MA","lat":42.563496,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.5649805069,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441473981000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/f\/6\/600_441642486.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Learn basic tools of Process Coaching, a self-empowering alternative to therapy or counseling offering a unique approach to deep emotional healing and true wholeness of being.<\/p> <p>This will be the first of a 6 class series meeting every other Thursday evening.<\/p> <p>* Free yourself from guilt, denial and judgments<\/p> <p>* Learn how to bring loving acceptance to <b>all<\/b> your feelings<\/p> <p>* Feel more love for yourself....and others<\/p> <p>*Manifest more of what you truly want in your life<\/p> <p>Call for more information or with any questions:[masked] \u00a0Sarah<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Cherry Street side  Red door","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Danvers-Explore-the-Universe-Within-Meetup\/events\/225143359\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Explore the Universe Within","id":"vrtmklytmbnb","time":1441924200000,"updated":1441933794000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440776076000,"name":"Danvers Explore the Universe Within Meetup","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":18876736,"urlname":"Danvers-Explore-the-Universe-Within-Meetup","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"Process Coaching Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":12,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440642755000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Wondering what the Knapsack Meetup group is all about, and what you might get out of it?

As a congregational rabbi for half a century and the best-selling author of twelve books on faith, ethics, and how to apply the timeless wisdom of religious thought to everyday challenges, Rabbi Harold S.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Graduate students take too long to complete their studies and face a dismal academic job market if they succeed. The Graduate School Mess gets to the root of these problems and offers concrete solutions for revitalizing graduate education in the humanities. Leonard Cassuto argues that universities\u2019 heavy emphasis on research comes at the expense of teaching. But teaching is where reforming graduate school must begin.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Cassuto says that graduate education must recover its mission of public service. Professors should revamp the graduate curriculum and broaden its narrow definition of success to allow students to create more fulfilling lives for themselves both inside and outside the academy. Cassuto frames the current situation foremost as a teaching problem: professors rarely prepare graduate students for the demands of the working worlds they will actually join. He gives practical advice about how faculty can teach and advise graduate students by committing to a student-centered approach.In chapters that follow the career of the graduate student from admissions to the dissertation and placement, Cassuto considers how each stage of graduate education is shaped by unexamined assumptions and ancient prejudices that need to be critically confronted. Written with verve and infused with history, The Graduate School Mess returns our national conversation about graduate study in the humanities to first principles.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Event Series: Friday Forum\u00a0<\/p> <p>Harvard Book Store's Friday Forum series takes place on Friday afternoons during the academic year as a way to highlight scholarly books in a wide range of fields, with a particular focus on local scholars.

His mother takes him to Febem (a juvenile correction center), believing that the system would give him the chance for a better life. At the institution, Roberto Carlos uses his creativity to obtain food and attention, and also learns how to influence his peers. When he becomes an adolescent, he is transferred to another institution where the rules are stricter. To escape physical punishment, Roberto Carlos and other boys discover the world or drugs and petty theft, running away every time he has the opportunity to do so. His behavior is defined as irrecoverable by the institution. At that point in his life, he meets the french educator Margherit Duvas, who, with extreme kindness, will slowly gain the affection of that troubled young man. She adopts him and he finally has the chance to learn how to read and write, and he sets his creative energy free when he becomes a student. They both relocate to France. After finishing his studies, Roberto Carlos returns to his hometown and goes back to Febem as an educator, starting his story with other children and adolescents whom he adopts and bring together as a big and happy family. He has now twenty adopted children, some of whom were deemed \u201cirrecoverable\u201d by the institution, the same way as he had been once.<\/p> <p>Spoken in Portuguese with subtitles in English, FREE and open to the public.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonOnyxbirds\/events\/225146528\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Brazilian Film Screening Friday September 11th","id":"225146528","time":1442011500000,"updated":1442024573000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1197747806000,"name":"Boston \"Onyxbirds\" Travel Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":877771,"urlname":"BostonOnyxbirds","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Onyxbirds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","city":"Lowell","address_1":"47 Lee St","name":"Lowell Makes","lon":-71.309738,"id":13811472,"state":"MA","lat":42.64629,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.2941532135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440372722000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Students will learn the process of hand-crafting the classic 11\/2\" wide wrist strap that buckles closed, with a watch affixed to the middle!<\/p> <p>The band will be built from couple of small brass rings, ranger style buckle &amp; billet, 2 colours of pre-dyed leather (black and brown), sparse studding<\/p> <p>Students bring their own wrist watch!<\/p> <p>About the Instructor:<\/p> <p>Gyllian has been designing &amp; crafting leather goods and costuming all over the Renaissance Faire and convention circuit for the last 40 years or so, as the lead designer and craftsman for Eeldrytch Leather Workshoppe his works are a staple of east coast Renfaire &amp; Larping community, and can be found on stages, television programs and commercials from both near and far.<\/p> <p>At Lowell Makes he oversees the Leather &amp; Costuming Department, in addition to teaching various classes Lowell Makes offer to it Members, as well as students from the public arena.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LowellMakes\/events\/224836611\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Leather Workshop: Watch Band","id":"224836611","time":1442012400000,"updated":1442024650000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1362436099000,"name":"Lowell Makes","group_lon":-71.3000030518,"id":7462972,"urlname":"LowellMakes","group_lat":42.6300010681,"who":"Makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02109","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"6 Commercial Street","name":"Sissy K's","lon":-71.053688,"id":16899912,"state":"MA","lat":42.359627,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":0.834829211235,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440190156000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>It's time for another great Friday Night Social Party!

about the Hindu Swami who brought yoga and meditation to the West in the 1920s. Paramahansa Yogananda authored the spiritual classic Autobiography of a Yogi, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and is a go-to book for seekers, philosophers and yoga enthusiasts today. By personalizing his own quest for enlightenment and sharing his struggles along the path, Yogananda made ancient Vedic teachings accessible to a modern audience, attracting many followers and inspiring the millions who practice yoga today.\u00a0Filmed over three years with the participation of 30 countries around the world, the documentary examines the world of yoga, modern and ancient, east and west and explores why millions today have turned their attention inwards, bucking the limitations of the material world in pursuit of self-realization.

The course is centered on experiential learning and hands-on skill building, including local field trips where we will see theory in action.

After his complex tale of humankind's relationship with nature in The Hungry Tide (2005), Ghosh returns to the narrative grandeur of The Glass Palace (2001) in this lengthy yet fast-flowing historical novel about England's ruthlessly run opium industry in occupied India. It begins in a sea of poppies in Bengal, and culminates on board the Ibis, an old slave ship carrying a motley group of outcasts. There's brave Deeti, a young fugitive widow; dashing Zachary, the son of a former slave and her American master; adventurous Paulette, a French orphan; and Neel, a fallen raja. In vivid settings ranging from the hellish precincts of an enormous opium factory, to absurdly lavish upper-class households, to the Ibis' grim hold, Ghosh unfurls tales of betrayal and tyranny, revelation and transformation, while reveling in the mischievous inventiveness of a bawdy polyglot lingo favored by sailors on Eastern seas. With intimations of Dickens and Melville, Ghosh's vital saga encompasses suspense and satire, perverse cruelty and profound kindness, and the countless ways humans conceal desire and fear behind arrogance and brutality. More frolicsome language, penetrating insights, and high adventure will follow now that the Ibis trilogy is under way.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Book on the table","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-1439\/events\/224563832\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"Sea of Poppies by Amitav Ghosh at Diva, Somerville","id":"224563832","time":1442073600000,"updated":1442082769000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1219087471000,"name":"Indian Food, Indian Fiction","group_lon":-71.2399978638,"id":1261834,"urlname":"bookclub-1439","group_lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Indian Bookwalas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.72169387341,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441306498000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Reportedly, this is the first time this many vegan food truck options are in one place!<\/p> <p>Come to Kendall Square to\u00a0enjoy gourmet vegan cuisine from 10+ of this area's best vegan food trucks!\u00a0<\/p> <p>A special VIP hour will take place from 11am-12noon.<br\/>General admission will be from 12pm-5pm.

Have you had a desire to learn how these swords were used in combat during the Renaissance era? Much more than shouting \u201cEn Garde!\u201d and assuming a guard stance; competent warriors fought with systems that included various ways to attack and defend, footwork, timing, and even rules of dueling, all based on a sophisticated understanding of body mechanics, mathematics and philosophy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/9\/d\/600_440793949.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The 16th century was a period of change for the sword. No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society. Blades slimmed and guards became more elaborate as the sword evolved into a nimble thrusting weapon worn by commoner and noble alike. As a result, a number of fencing schools opened to capitalize on their growing popularity. The golden age of rapier study dawned around 1550; numerous masters publishing fencing system manuals over the century to follow, with topics including rapier, off-hand companions such as the dagger, buckler and cape, long sword, quarterstaff, pole arm, dagger alone, and grappling.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/e\/600_440793934.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our six-week Novice Rapier course will introduce the basic techniques and vocabulary of rapier fencing, enabling students to begin their study of period combat and the Art of Defence.

Their mission is to provide healthy meals in a safe and inviting atmosphere, free from Society\u2019s prejudices and judgments. This is an interfaith, interracial, interdenominational activity of people concerned with the hungry in the Boston area.<\/p> <p>Over the course of its 25 years, Saturday\u2019s\/Sunday\u2019s Bread has served more than 300,000 guests. Directions<\/p> <p>Saturdays Bread is located at The Church of St. John the Evangelist is at 35 Bowdoin Street, Boston, between Cambridge Street and Derne Street behind the State House. The entrance to the dining hall is through the door to the right of the main church entrance. Go up the ramp and ring the bell marked \"Clayton Hall,\" not \"Church Business\" or \"Common Room.\" Please be patient; it sometimes is hard to hear the bell in the dining hall or kitchen.<\/p> <p>Parking: Parking is a challenge, so it's a good idea to carpool or to go by T if possible. The on-street parking is very scarce. The closest public parking is the 100 Cambridge Street Parking Garage, which you enter from Somerset Street, one block east of Bowdoin. Parking at the garage is $7.00 for the full day on weekends.<\/p> <p>There are a few other small parking lots nearby. The Boston Common Garage, a little further away, is $10 for the full day on weekends.<\/p> <p>To reach the 100 Cambridge Street Parking Garage: Coming from Storrow Drive and West, go one block past Bowdoin Street (and past the 100 Cambridge Street building). Turn right at the next light onto Somerset. Coming from Government Center and South\/East, turn left at the end of Center Plaza, the large, curved building opposite Government Center. The garage is on the right in the first block. If the auto entrance door is down, please knock; the garage is open Saturdays and Sundays.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation: The closest T stop is the Government Center stop on the Green Line. From the subway exit, walk west on Cambridge Street two blocks and turn left on Bowdoin. The walk from the Park Street (Red\/Green Line) station is a little longer, but a pleasant walk in good weather. Follow Park Street toward the State House, turn right on Beacon, then quickly left onto Bowdoin.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please meet the organizers in the kitchen.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-Volunteers-Boston\/events\/222789867\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":14400000,"name":"Help Serve a Meal at Saturday's Bread (September)","id":"222789867","time":1442075400000,"updated":1442091774000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351383020000,"name":"Single Volunteers Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":5588692,"urlname":"Single-Volunteers-Boston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02466","country":"us","city":"Newton","address_1":"64 Hancock Street","name":"United Parish of Auburndale","lon":-71.250153,"id":16868012,"state":"MA","lat":42.343826,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.28540802002,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441329890000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be demonstrating and letting children explore the violin, viola, cello, bass, guitar and flute.

Let's go trail horse back riding. I will need a head count at least\u00a0a few weeks ahead of time to let them know how many plan to attend. The ride is an hour long. It costs $40 per person. They can't accommodate more than 13 so I am going to guess 10 would be a good number max. I have always wanted to do this. We may have to adjust the time a bit based on availability but let's plan for this afternoon.<\/p> <p>Here's some info:<\/p> <p><b>Q: What do you do on a Trail ride?A: <\/b>Our guided western style trail rides are through a variety of trails, including\u00a0\u00a0wooded areas, sand, over streams and around a pond. A trail ride is meant to be a relaxing ride on horseback to enjoy nature. You may even see a deer or two\u00a0along the way.<\/p> <p><b>Q: Is there an age requirement?A: <\/b>Children must be 7 years or older and <b>at least<\/b> 48 inches tall.<\/p> <p><b>Q: Is there a weight limit?A: <\/b>Yes, we have a weight limit of no more than 250 pounds. \u00a0We reserve the right to refuse anyone whose size may threaten the health of our horses.<\/p> <p><b>Q: What should I wear?A: <\/b>You should wear comfortable weather appropriate clothing, long pants, sturdy footwear, sneakers are fine (no open toe shoes, flip flops or sandals). A limited number of helmets are available, you may use your own riding or bicycle helmet if you prefer. Helmets are not required but are always recommended.<br\/>You will be riding through wooded areas, so bug spray is always a good idea.<\/p> <p><b>Q: I have never been on a horse before, can I still ride?A: <\/b>Yes you can. We have many first time riders. Our Guides are experienced<br\/>riders and are there to assist you. Just follow the simple instructions that will<br\/>be given to you, and you should do just fine. If at any time during your ride you have a question, feel free to ask any of the Guides and they will be happy to assist you.<\/p> <p><b>Q: What if my child is unable to control their horse?A: <\/b>If any person is unsure about being able to control their horse, a guide can lead your horse from their horse.<\/p> <p><b>Q: I have been riding for a while. Do you offer anything more advanced like<br\/>canter rides?A: <\/b>Yes, We offer cantering rides for capable riders as judged by our guides.<\/p> <p><b>Q: How do I know if I am ready for a more advanced ride?A: <\/b>Our Guides will evaluate all riders who choose to take the more advanced<br\/>rides. If they feel you are unable to continue at that level, they will move you<br\/>down to a level that is better suited to your ability.<\/p> <p><b>Q: Why do I have to ride single file?A: <\/b>We ride single file to maintain safety of all our riders and horses.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Ask for Miah's group!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forties-Friends-and-Funseekers-Metrowest\/events\/224121183\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Go Horseback Riding!","id":"224121183","time":1442084400000,"updated":1442090063000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1437306422000,"name":"Forties Friends and Funseekers - Metrowest","group_lon":-71.1699981689,"id":18751790,"urlname":"Forties-Friends-and-Funseekers-Metrowest","group_lat":42.2400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438195150000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>FREE TOUR STARTS AT 3:30PM!<\/p> <p>Most of us know about the Slumbrew beer garden at Assembly row, but they also have a brewery\/taproom.

A new revolutionary culture was emerging and it sought to drastically transform the system. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense would, for a short time, put itself at the vanguard of that change. The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution is the first feature length documentary to explore the Black Panther Party, its significance to the broader American culture, its cultural and political awakening for black people, and the painful lessons wrought when a movement derails. Master documentarian Stanley Nelson (Freedom Riders, Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple) goes straight to the source, weaving a treasure trove of rare archival footage with the voices of the people who were there: police, FBI informants, journalists, white supporters and detractors, and Black Panthers who remained loyal to the party and those who left it. Featuring Kathleen Cleaver, Elaine Brown, Emory Douglas, Jamal Joseph, and many others, it\u2019s an essential history and a vibrant chronicle of this pivotal movement that birthed a new revolutionary culture in America.<\/p> <p>Check out the trailer,<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/F56O3kZ9qr0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/F56O3kZ9qr0<\/a><\/p> <p>The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution<br\/>by filmmaker Stanley Nelson<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/8\/c\/600_441726796.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I was 15 years old in 1966 when the Black Panthers were formed. The Panthers were talking about problems that had to do with our lives in the North, and as a New Yorker I was naturally attracted to them. Their look, their language, their boldness\u2014it spoke to me.<\/p> <p>At 20, I went to see The Murder of Fred Hampton, a documentary about the Chicago Police murder of a Panther leader. The film gave me even more insight into the Panthers, but it also made me look at the power of film to move audiences. It lit a fire inside of me to make films, and I\u2019ve been on this path ever since.<\/p> <p>Seven years ago, I finally set out to tell the story that had been in my mind all of those years. No one had documented the rise and fall of the Black Panther Party, and I wanted to shed light on a history that had never been told in its entirety. There is so much we think we know about the Party, but I wanted to go beyond the oversimplified narrative of the Panthers as prone to violence and consumed with anger, and explore why hundreds of young people joined, what they accomplished, and why it fell apart.<\/p> <p>I also wanted to lift up the voices of rank and file members. We often hear about the leadership, but not unlike the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement, the rank and file Party members were the lifeblood of the organization. They delivered Party newspapers, tested people for sickle cell anemia, registered voters, and fed thousands of children through their Free Breakfast programs. These were people in their teens and twenties who demonstrated an enormous amount of courage, discipline and organization. And despite their missteps and the FBI\u2019s campaign to bring them down, what was so clear to me was that their motivation came from their undying love for their community.<\/p> <p>Now, almost 50 years after the founding of the Panthers, we find ourselves at the start of a new movement for justice and equality led, yet again, by young people. We didn\u2019t set out to make a film that was about today, but as we began shooting, it became painfully clear that so many things the Panthers were fighting for were things that are still issues today. From police brutality, substandard schools and substandard housing, to disenchantment with the political system.<\/p> <p>I hope that young people come to see the film and reflect on the Black Panther Party, and consider the similarities\u2014and differences\u2014between what the Panthers tried to build, and the new movement that is taking shape today. I hope this history inspires young people, who may see their own desire for change reflected in the story of the Black Panther Party.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, I wanted to bring this vibrant chapter in American history to life so that we can all understand it, learn from it, and make better decisions\u2014personally and collectively.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meetup POINT is inside beside the ATM machine in the LOBBY at 4:00 PM before the show and after the post film talk.

A new revolutionary culture was emerging and it sought to drastically transform the system. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense would, for a short time, put itself at the vanguard of that change. The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution is the first feature length documentary to explore the Black Panther Party, its significance to the broader American culture, its cultural and political awakening for black people, and the painful lessons wrought when a movement derails. Master documentarian Stanley Nelson (Freedom Riders, Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple) goes straight to the source, weaving a treasure trove of rare archival footage with the voices of the people who were there: police, FBI informants, journalists, white supporters and detractors, and Black Panthers who remained loyal to the party and those who left it. Featuring Kathleen Cleaver, Elaine Brown, Emory Douglas, Jamal Joseph, and many others, it\u2019s an essential history and a vibrant chronicle of this pivotal movement that birthed a new revolutionary culture in America.<\/p> <p>Check out the trailer,<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/F56O3kZ9qr0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/F56O3kZ9qr0<\/a><\/p> <p>The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution<br\/>by filmmaker Stanley Nelson<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/8\/c\/600_441726796.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I was 15 years old in 1966 when the Black Panthers were formed. The Panthers were talking about problems that had to do with our lives in the North, and as a New Yorker I was naturally attracted to them. Their look, their language, their boldness\u2014it spoke to me.<\/p> <p>At 20, I went to see The Murder of Fred Hampton, a documentary about the Chicago Police murder of a Panther leader. The film gave me even more insight into the Panthers, but it also made me look at the power of film to move audiences. It lit a fire inside of me to make films, and I\u2019ve been on this path ever since.<\/p> <p>Seven years ago, I finally set out to tell the story that had been in my mind all of those years. No one had documented the rise and fall of the Black Panther Party, and I wanted to shed light on a history that had never been told in its entirety. There is so much we think we know about the Party, but I wanted to go beyond the oversimplified narrative of the Panthers as prone to violence and consumed with anger, and explore why hundreds of young people joined, what they accomplished, and why it fell apart.<\/p> <p>I also wanted to lift up the voices of rank and file members. We often hear about the leadership, but not unlike the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement, the rank and file Party members were the lifeblood of the organization. They delivered Party newspapers, tested people for sickle cell anemia, registered voters, and fed thousands of children through their Free Breakfast programs. These were people in their teens and twenties who demonstrated an enormous amount of courage, discipline and organization. And despite their missteps and the FBI\u2019s campaign to bring them down, what was so clear to me was that their motivation came from their undying love for their community.<\/p> <p>Now, almost 50 years after the founding of the Panthers, we find ourselves at the start of a new movement for justice and equality led, yet again, by young people. We didn\u2019t set out to make a film that was about today, but as we began shooting, it became painfully clear that so many things the Panthers were fighting for were things that are still issues today. From police brutality, substandard schools and substandard housing, to disenchantment with the political system.<\/p> <p>I hope that young people come to see the film and reflect on the Black Panther Party, and consider the similarities\u2014and differences\u2014between what the Panthers tried to build, and the new movement that is taking shape today. I hope this history inspires young people, who may see their own desire for change reflected in the story of the Black Panther Party.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, I wanted to bring this vibrant chapter in American history to life so that we can all understand it, learn from it, and make better decisions\u2014personally and collectively.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meetup POINT is inside beside the ATM machine in the LOBBY at 6:30 PM before the show and after the post film talk.

Very rewarding, though, for those few cool shots.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/b\/b\/600_441630907.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Note that this event is self-directed, there is no formal group gathering<\/b>, but I suggested a good starting point.<\/p> <p><br\/>The lighting begins at 7:22, finding a place to shoot will take some time and so does parking. The Providence Place Mall garage is very cheap but also very popular for this event, it may be full unless you arrive early. I usually park in the streets or smaller lots 10 blocks away (where you will end up if you walk down the river).<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring both a wide angle lens as well as a medium zoom for close-ups, no problem walking around with a tripod, but be careful not to trip anyone in the dense crowds. As you walk further down the river, the crowds spread out and it gets easier, especially half an hour after the lighting ceremony.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/waterfire.org\/blog\/september-12th-2015-full-lighting\/\">The official website<\/a> has more details. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/photos\/18126932\/#[masked]\">Here is the link to a prior event<\/a>.<\/p> <p>The best meeting place is a small, circular plaza underneath the main road, see \"How to find us\" for exact coordinates (copy\/paste them into Google maps). Just above, on Memorial Blvd, is the best place to view the parade, lighting ceremony and torch circle. From there, you can walk down the river to find lots of fires in the river, gondolas, street performers, glass blowers, living statues and gargoyles, art stands, food and more for a very diverse set of objects.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/c\/5\/600_441630917.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/c\/a\/600_441630922.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225137122\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Waterfire Providence","id":"225137122","time":1442098800000,"updated":1442111962000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"17 Spring Street, Watertown, MA","name":"Watertown Center for Healing Arts","lon":0,"id":23609764,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":24,"distance":5.66982889175,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440038568000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"pre-paid; $35 at door","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are all connected energetically, yet most of us haven\u2019t honed our sensitivity to feel the subtle play of energy within and between us.

Sadly, with the recent passing of singer Brad Delp, their legacy draws even closer to that of the Fab Four's. Doing their best to fill Delp's Beatle Boots will be an array of local singers.

I joined this group when I was visiting Boston earlier this year. I am contacting you because there is a CRY (Child Rights and You) Walk for Child Rights taking place next Sunday in Brookline organized with volunteers from CRY Boston. CRY is a nonprofit that has been in India for 35 years helping protect the rights of children and in the U.S. for 13 years.

The super short ride has no lunch stop. Most of the ride is on residential and rural roads with few traffic lights. Points of interest include Framingham Country Club, Charlie Chan's summer home, Whitehall Lake and State Park, scenic brooks, Upton State Forest, farms, llamas and the Ashland Town Forest. In nice weather this ride can attract over 70 riders.

The picture above is from one of last years rides. Don't let the # of RSVPs here fool you, these rides are always well atended usually with over 25 riders of all abilities.<\/p> <p><br\/>The distances\u00a0and routes vary every week. We'll have \"No Drop Rule\" so you won't have to worry about getting lost or keeping up. Ride with us if you ride anywhere from 15 to 20 MPH.<\/p> <p>Always bring two spare tubes, and your preferred hydration and nutrition. We don't typically stop for lunch but depending on the ride, there are sometimes options to stop for a bit. Before riding it's good practice to get your bike tuned. Remember to dress for the elements.<\/p> <p>Also CRW organizes a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=s\">Spring Century<\/a>, a Summer Century called <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/CTTC\/climb2clouds.php\">Climb to the Clouds<\/a>, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/crw.org\/century.php?event=f\">Fall Century<\/a>.

I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement.

You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous.

This is a great opportunity to shoot elaborately costumed dancers as they parade from near the Whole Foods Market on River St. to Kendall Sq. where there will be performances, food, vendors and the like.<\/p> <p>I suggest we meet at Riverside Press Park at the corner of Blackstone &amp; River Streets, where the participants gather to put on their costumes and start the parade. I find this offers a much better shooting opportunity than the parade itself as you can get some good candid shots as well as ask individuals to move around for you to get them in better light, minimize distracting backgrounds, etc. As with most costumed events, these folks are pleased as punch to have their pictures taken so don't be shy about walking up to someone and asking!<\/p> <p>The parade is scheduled to start at 12:30 but they often start late (Island Time don't you know). Lets meet an hour earlier (11:30) so we have plenty of time to catch them in the marshaling area. We can then follow the parade down River St., through Central Sq. and end up at Kendall for the afternoon.<\/p> <p>My only two suggestions are to bring an off camera speedlight to tame harsh shadows on faces and earplugs to save your hearing from the window rattling sound trucks.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonAreaPhotography\/events\/224953168\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Cambridge Carnival International","id":"224953168","time":1442158200000,"updated":1442441659000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1373205921000,"name":"Boston Area Photography Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":9247672,"urlname":"BostonAreaPhotography","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Photo Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02114","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"111 Dartmouth","address_2":"Boston","lon":-71.07,"phone":"NEAR Back Bay T stop","name":"Brownstone","id":280086,"state":"MA","lat":42.360001,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441666926000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Small get together of about 10 people looking to make friends and network<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mid-20s-Early-30s-LGBT-Professionals-Group-Boston\/events\/225190969\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":9000000,"name":"Sunday Brunch","id":"225190969","time":1442158200000,"updated":1442180944000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441664637000,"name":"20's - 30's LGBT Professionals Group: Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18909102,"urlname":"Mid-20s-Early-30s-LGBT-Professionals-Group-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","phone":"617-547-3721","address_1":"4 Pleasant Street","name":"Pandemonium Books & Games","lon":-71.105592,"id":875759,"state":"MA","lat":42.366253,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.87152814865,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441384640000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Boston Lodge of The Pathfinder Society is running multiple scenarios at Pandemonium Books and Games from noon to about 4:30 PM.<\/p> <p><i><b>Please sign up on our Warhorn site!!!<\/b><\/i> (<a href=\"https:\/\/warhorn.net\/events\/boston-pfs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/warhorn.net\/events\/boston-pfs\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/warhorn.net\/events\/boston-pfs<\/a><\/a>).

They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous.

FREE ADMISSION.<\/p> <p><br\/>BERNINI IN ECSTASY is a portrait of one of our greatest artists, the sculptor, architect, painter and playwright Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598 \u2014 1680). In his lifetime, the tempestuous, ambitious Bernini was both a legend and a scandal to the Romans; yet he became the intimate of eight popes. This play follows Bernini from the lowest moment of his career to the creation of his most famous statue, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Against the backdrop of Baroque Rome and the Catholic Church in the Age of Absolutism, BERNINI IN ECSTASY presents the mythic personalities who inhabited this rarefied world at a critical time in history and portrays these great figures in all their humanity. BERNINI IN ECSTASY is more than a history play; it's more than a religious play or a play about power; it's more than a play about patronage or sexuality or the role of women. BERNINI IN ECSTASY illuminates the perennial struggle between art and commerce, between spiritual inspiration and religious dogma, between the spirit and the flesh; and in doing so, it deepens our understanding of the world today.<\/p> <p>This is a staged reading of BERNINI IN ECSTASY by professional actors. It will last about 2 hours, with one intermission, to be followed by a conversation between the audience, the playwright, and the director.<\/p> <p>at THE DANTE ALIGHIERI SOCIETY<\/p> <p>41 Hampshire St<\/p> <p>(Kendall Square, 2 blocks from Kendall Square Cinema), Cambridge, MA 02139,[masked]<\/p> <p>SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2015<\/p> <p>from 3:00 pm to (approx.) 5:30 pm.

In an interview with Democracy Now! Gonzalez describes the book:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>\u201c[T]he central theme of Harvest of Empire is that\u2026you cannot understand the enormous Latino presence in the United States unless you understand America\u2019s role in Latin America, and in fact that the Latino presence in the country is the harvest of the empire. It is the result of more than a century of domination of many of these countries. And in fact, those countries that were most dominated by the United States are the ones that have sent the most migrants to this country. And Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, [El] Salvador, Guatemala, these are the countries that have provided the bulk of the migration from Latin America, largely many of them fleeing from the civil wars, as in the cases of Guatemala and Nicaragua and El Salvador, in which the United States government played a key role in backing one side or the other, others coming here as a result of the needs of American businesses that established migration and recruiting, actually recruited people to come here to fill jobs\u2014that\u2019s more so in the case of the Puerto Ricans and the Mexicans. And so, in essence\u2026the mass migration flows of Latin Americans to this country were a direct response to the needs of the empire. Most Americans are not aware of that, because most Americans don\u2019t even think of our country as an empire.\u201c[W]hat I\u2019ve tried to do in the book is chart how each of the different Latino groups came, what was happening in their country that forced them to leave\u2026what cities did they first arrive in, how did they establish their communities, what kind of hostility or welcome did they meet when they arrived in these various cities around the country, and basically tried to\u2026paint a picture, the human picture, of how it was that this country is now facing this enormous explosion of Latino population.\"<\/p> <p>Because of space limitations, a maximum of 16 people can attend.

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Erika and Jack<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be there signing our beautiful language to inspire all of you!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonasl\/events\/224866897\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"ASL WEEKLY SOCIAL","id":"qfrwkfytmbrb","time":1442174400000,"updated":1442236076000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1223604065000,"name":"Boston ASL","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1298565,"urlname":"bostonasl","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"ASL Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","city":"Brookline","phone":"617.879.9988","address_1":"1431 Beacon St","name":"Brookline Ballet School","lon":-71.126214,"id":1182611,"state":"MA","lat":42.340701,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.17173099518,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436239414000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Kids ages 4-10 FINALLY have a home to learn Bollywood dance and perform on STAGE!!

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test.

The area is amazingly safe to walk at night; the MIT students don't know when to stop so are always around<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Inventors-Association-of-New-England\/events\/158809192\/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"name":"Inventor's\/Entrepreneur's Meeting & Speaker","id":"158809192","time":1442271600000,"updated":1442285045000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1232996370000,"name":"Inventors Association of New England","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1367613,"urlname":"Inventors-Association-of-New-England","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Inventors and Service Providers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02109","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"Corner of Cross and Hanover Street","name":"Rose Kennedy Greenway Park","lon":-71.055801,"id":1616652,"state":"MA","lat":42.362556,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.747321009636,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441859038000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>After the pilates, lets walk through the Greenway Conservancy path, down Newbury St. and Beacon St. until we arrive to Coolidge Corner. \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Greenway is about 1.5miles of contemporary parks.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n*Total walk is 5miles 1-way. \u00a0So, if you plan to walk back it will be 10miles total.<\/p> <p>*It will be dark during the walk, but it is along street lights. \u00a0Wear good walking shoes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.rosekennedygreenway.org\/files\/2713\/0084\/1069\/web_wayfinding.gif\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"After the class, meet up near the DJ table","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Active-Healthy-and-Social-in-Eastern-Mass\/events\/225250691\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Group Walk: Greenway Park, Newbury St. and Beacon St.","id":"225250691","time":1442272500000,"updated":1442281424000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1422412703000,"name":"Active, Healthy, and Social in Eastern Mass","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":18387103,"urlname":"Active-Healthy-and-Social-in-Eastern-Mass","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Healthy Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"5 Longfellow Park","name":"Cambridge Friends Meeting House","lon":-71.127358,"id":918727,"state":"MA","lat":42.375848,"repinned":false},"headcount":17,"distance":3.13258886337,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1320695671000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(Please note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)<\/p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup<\/p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/225035613\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytmbsb","time":1442273400000,"updated":1442324624000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692537784576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441067399000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi guys!\u00a0 Join us for some authentic Tibetan food at Rangzen on Central Square.<\/p> <p><br\/>Rangzen's dumplings are hands down some of the best I've had in Boston.\u00a0 They also have a number of other mainstream dishes with a Tibetan twist.<\/p> <p>Take a look at their menu here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/rangzenrestaurant.com\/menu.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/rangzenrestaurant.com\/menu.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/rangzenrestaurant.com\/menu.html<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FavoriteRestaurants\/events\/225027443\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Palace","id":"225027443","time":1442273400000,"updated":1442337323000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1417717451000,"name":"Discover Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants: 20's and 30's!","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18232263,"urlname":"FavoriteRestaurants","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Hungry people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01801","country":"us","city":"Woburn","phone":"781-933-1709","address_1":"32 Montvale Ave","name":"Woburn Bowladrome","lon":-71.149801,"id":689387,"state":"MA","lat":42.479304,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":9.21205234528,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426629163000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join fellow LGBT folks for some informal bowling!<\/b> The score isn't important - having fun and enjoying the company is!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Meanwhile, innumerable animal lives are lost, and the process often fails to predict human responses because traditional animal models do not accurately mimic human physiology. For these reasons, the pharmaceutical industry needs alternative ways to screen drug candidates in the laboratory.

Ingber, MD, PhD<br\/>Professor, Harvard Medical School &amp; Boston Children's Hospital<\/p> <p>Dr. Donald E. Ingber is the Founding Director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the John A. Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. His most recent innovation is a technology for building tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs, or \"Organs on Chips\", that mimic complicated human functions as a way to replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and establishment of human disease models. He was also the first to recognize that tensegrity architecture is a fundamental principle that governs how living cells are structured to respond biochemically to mechanical forces, and to demonstrate that integrin receptors mediate cellular mechanotransduction. Dr. Ingber has authored more than 375 publications and 85 patents, and has received numerous honors including the Holst Medal, Pritzker Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society, Rous-Whipple Award from the American Society for Investigative Pathology, Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of In Vitro Biology, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Innovator Award.<\/p> <p>Geraldine Hamilton, PhD<br\/>President and Chief Scientific Officer, Emulate<\/p> <p>Geraldine A.

The Sox have been playing at a level that means I don't feel particularly bad about not watching them, the Pats are in first place and kids are going back to school. Weather is still with us though, and if you're like me; and I know I am, you love the Boston skyline at night. So how about a Charles River run to go take it all in?<\/p> <p>Planning on being at the Magazine Beach Park launch at 6ish for a (BIB) butts-in-boats time of 6:30pm. Sunset is 6:58pm, so I want to make sure we're out on the river to see it as we paddle along to the Esplanade through the lagoon. We'll pass the Hatch Shell and the sailing marina on our way to take a gander of the Zakim Bridge and the Charles River Dam. There probably isn't a paddler among us who hasn't driven across the bridge or has at least seen it at night. You're gonna love the view up at it from your kayak.<br\/>Onward we'll go sneaking through North Point Park, back around the horn in front of the Museum of Science to the Galleria and then we do a lazy paddle upstream on the northern bank of the river. By this time, Boston should be fully lit and spread out for our viewing pleasure on the port side all the way back to the landing.<\/p> <p>This is a level 1 paddle - river will be calm and protected. Open to all boats - must be able to paddle in a group and keep pace - expected pace ~3 knots for 3 hours. Planned distance ~7 miles. PFD are required to be correctly worn. Night paddle - A suitable all round light required. Glow sticks on boat and PFD are acceptable. Headlamps or flashlights are recommended for as-needed use in navigation and landing.<\/p> <p>I am not aware of any bathrooms available at the launch, but there are some available in the Esplanade. When you approach the park, go past the main entrance and use the ball field entrance. There you will find the ample parking and the ramp.

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/225243297\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytmbtb","time":1442356200000,"updated":1442368533000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":16,"distance":4.95320987701,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1302493619000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our traditional monthly event has a great relaxed format and location!\u00a0 Join fellow Beanstalks for an economical evening featuring good conversation, variety of food and an excellent movie.<\/p> <p>Bring a dish to share, then after we eat we\u2019ll watch a DVD on Jan &amp; Susan\u2019s big screen TV.\u00a0 Multiple current and classic DVDs will be available (feel free to bring one along if you like).\u00a0 Whatever the group can agree on is what we\u2019ll watch.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/tall-15\/events\/225243430\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Dinner & a Movie Night","id":"fbqvqytmbtb","time":1442356200000,"updated":1442571112000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1169420697000,"name":"The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":410040,"urlname":"tall-15","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Beanstalks and their Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"74 Acton St","name":"Central Rock Climbing Gym","lon":-71.198532,"id":13269882,"state":"MA","lat":42.3694,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.60749197006,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425939087000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's climb at Central Rock Gym in Watertown!

What then? Because an awakening is only the beginning of the spiritual journey, not the end. And when, as in Sat Shree\u2019s case, there had been no preparation, no spiritual questing or even desire for a more spiritual life, this kind of rude, \u201ckundalini\u201d awakening can be easily mistaken for enlightenment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Somehow he knew it was a temporary state and therefore not the final answer. And so his journey began, leading away from his middle class life in Nevada, to a meeting with a teacher far ahead of him on the path, to years in an ashram in India, through increasingly ecstatic\u2014and equally challenging \u2014meditative experiences, through four distinct stages of enlightenment, and back to the United States. He is now the director of his New Dharma community in Nevada, where the force that is at work within him is shifting the reality of people that are drawn to it.<\/p> <p>Sat Shree\u2019s mission is to\u00a0<i>manifest a new spiritual culture that is in alignment with universal spiritual principles, and by doing so inspire mankind to create a sustainable future.\u00a0<\/i>\u201cMy work,\u201d he says, \u201cis to show people how to collaborate with the natural maturation process that occurs when one is on the spiritual path.

Richard Futrell, a PhD student in Cognitive Science at MIT, will discuss the remarkable variations among languages: some languages require you to mark gender all the time; in other languages never. In some languages you can rearrange words in whatever order you like, whereas in others such as English, you can\u2019t. Surprisingly, many of the universal properties of languages and the range of arrangements in particular languages can be predicted by assuming that languages are efficient and robust communication systems. Futrell explains how this recent line of research works, and what it can tell us about language and the human mind. Do You Plan to Attend?

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

Research shows that many of today\u2019s chronic diseases are completely tied to what we eat and the lifestyle choices we make.

They are encouraged to read labels of processed foods and to make better choices of unprocessed and raw foods to nourish their bodies with adequate fiber and natural enzymes. Parents are also educated as part of this program. One of the parents of RKRF, trained by our organization, is launching\u00a0<i>Familia Saludable\u00a0<\/i>for Spanish-speaking parents. Our larger goal is to encourage change in their lifestyles by building better habits such as reading, exercise, self-care and gardening, which will enable them to love fresh foods.

Darlene Stokes and Tom Lane will also lead the group in additional exercises designed to increase flexibility and build a strong core. Last year we had many people from Meetup join us for these workouts. Some even became regular guests up at our ski house in NH. Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. The workouts last 1.5 hours and are always immediately followed by a few drinks and sometimes some food at a variety of Waltham Center Bars\/Restaurants. Please wear work-out clothes and athletic shoes with some ankle support.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/f\/9\/600_10414809.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet in the center of Waltham common near the flag poles.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wedelns\/events\/225082683\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Pre-season ski fitness training","id":"lrxgklytmbvb","time":1442442600000,"updated":1442455530000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1189913538000,"name":"Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":687583,"urlname":"Wedelns","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Wedelns"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Beverly","address_1":"314 Cabot St","name":"Papa Gino's","lon":-70.878685,"id":23890921,"lat":42.552982,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":16.5534744263,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440628533000,"fee":{"amount":0.5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Map below:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/b\/6\/600_438484022.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>PLEASE SIGN-UP SO OTHER PEOPLE WILL KNOW OTHERS WILL BE ATTENDING.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Official<\/i><\/b> time reset to 6:30 pm, \u00a0of course, there is nothing to change people coming earlier at around 6:00\u00a0as usual.<\/p> <p><br\/>We have had\u00a06 to\u00a08 people lately for each Cribbage night, but having more people is always better.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the cards.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/salemsocialcards\/events\/225074734\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Cribbage Meetup Wednesday @ Papa Gino's Beverly","id":"pdwgklytmbvb","time":1442442600000,"updated":1442499586000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326050741000,"name":"Salem Social Cards","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3068172,"urlname":"salemsocialcards","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6631984711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441224602000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price or dine at El Talle","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>El Taller has very generously given us this space to use for Meetup but they thought members might eat at the caf\u00e9 downstairs.<\/p> <p>I do feel we should reciprocate.

Instead, he finds that he has joined a new world where race is front and center. The recipient of a scholarship designed to increase black student enrollment, Tweedy soon meets a professor who bluntly questions whether he belongs in medical school, a moment that crystallizes the challenges he will face throughout his career. Making matters worse, in lecture after lecture the common refrain for numerous diseases resounds, \"More common in blacks than whites.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Black Man in a White Coat examines the complex ways in which both black doctors and patients must navigate the difficult and often contradictory terrain of race and medicine. As Tweedy transforms from student to practicing physician, he discovers how often race influences his encounters with patients. Through their stories, he illustrates the complex social, cultural, and economic factors at the root of most health problems in the black community. These issues take on greater meaning when Tweedy is himself diagnosed with a chronic disease far more common among black people. In this powerful, moving, and deeply empathic book, Tweedy explores the challenges confronting black doctors, and the disproportionate health burdens faced by black patients, ultimately seeking a way forward to better treatment and more compassionate care.<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

In <i>The Simpsons Movie<\/i>, the US federal government put a giant plastic bubble around the town of Springfield. What commonly used state policies would have the same economic effect?<\/p> <p>2. In Japan, people have very long life expectancies, the birth rate is very low, and very few immigrants are allowed. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso recently said about the elderly: \"The problem won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.\u201d What problem is Aso talking about? Does the US face this problem? Why does the US face a less-extreme version of this problem than Japan?<\/p> <p>3. In a free market, capital flows to its most profitable uses. When the state erects barriers to entry, capital is restricted from flowing to its most profitable uses. What are the economic consequences of restricting the movement of capital? How does this relate to immigration?<\/p> <p>4. A recent voter initiative in Switzerland proposed giving every citizen $3,250 a month, which, even when adjusted for cost of living differences, would put every Swiss citizen in the top 1% of income earners worldwide. Could Switzerland open its borders with such a policy? Could Hong Kong keep its open borders and adopt such a policy? Do both the CATO study and Paul Krugman both agree that immigration correlates with a smaller welfare state? What does this say about the Cloward-Piven strategy, a strategy two sociologists proposed for turning the US into a welfare state through opening the borders?<\/p> <p>5. When New York City tried to raise its city income tax to 4%, it received less tax revenue than when the tax was 2%. Why might this be? If NYC was a city state with immigration restrictions, could it get away with a higher tax rate?<\/p> <p>6. When Georgia passed a tough anti-immigrant law in 2012, crops rotted in the fields in a scope not seen in decades since hardline communism fell. Why did supply and demand fail to match?<\/p> <p>7. A study in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology reports that homicides negatively correlate with immigration in US cities, with the strongest effect being in cities with the highest number of immigrants. Why might this be? Why might this study be misleading?<\/p> <p>8. A recent Pew survey found that 95% of Vietnamese citizens support capitalism over socialism, 76% of Chinese citizens do as well, while only 70% of Americans support this. Why might this be?<\/p> <p>9. Besides border walls, what other migration barriers does the state erect? Do some of these barriers prevent Americans from moving inside America?<\/p> <p>10. Why were immigration restrictions listed as a charge against the King in the Declaration of Independence? \u201cHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Austrian-Economics-Group\/events\/225355539\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"The Economics of Refugees","id":"225355539","time":1442444400000,"updated":1442457604000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1349279652000,"name":"Boston Austrian Economics Group","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":5224182,"urlname":"Boston-Austrian-Economics-Group","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Praxeologists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02129","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Prospect St, Central Square","name":"Workbar Cambridge","lon":-71.058311,"id":13528122,"state":"MA","lat":42.376041,"repinned":false},"headcount":34,"distance":1.26123464108,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440422812000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the first presentation for Boston Sports Analytics by Josh Walker of The Youth Fantasy League. \u00a0Here is the description of what to expect:<\/p> <p>The Youth Fantasy League\u00a0will demonstrate how it's using data science to create the first fantasy sports league for young sports fans. \u00a0 We will cover how we are using both historical and real-time sports data feeds in our prototype for our NFL product launch.

This event is co-sponsored by\u00a0Mass Humanities and the\u00a0Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.<\/p> <p>Black Man in a White Coat\u00a0is one\u00a0doctor's passionate and profound memoir of his experience grappling with race, bias, and the unique health problems of black Americans<\/p> <p>When Damon Tweedy begins medical school,he envisions a bright future where his segregated, working-class background will become largely irrelevant. Instead, he finds that he has joined a new world where race is front and center. The recipient of a scholarship designed to increase black student enrollment, Tweedy soon meets a professor who bluntly questions whether he belongs in medical school, a moment that crystallizes the challenges he will face throughout his career. Making matters worse, in lecture after lecture the common refrain for numerous diseases resounds, \"More common in blacks than whites.\"<\/p> <p><i>Black Man in a White Coat\u00a0<\/i>examines the complex ways in which both black doctors and patients must navigate the difficult and often contradictory terrain of race and medicine. As Tweedy transforms from student to practicing physician, he discovers how often race influences his encounters with patients. Through their stories, he illustrates the complex social, cultural, and economic factors at the root of most health problems in the black community. These issues take on greater meaning when Tweedy is himself diagnosed with a chronic disease far more common among black people. In this powerful, moving, and deeply empathic book, Tweedy explores the challenges confronting black doctors, and the disproportionate health burdens faced by black patients, ultimately seeking a way forward to better treatment and more compassionate care.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Black-Book-Club\/events\/225211332\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Author's Talk:  Black Man in a White Coat by Damon Tweedy","id":"225211332","time":1442444400000,"updated":1443275935000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355372043000,"name":"The Cambridge-Boston Black Book Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":6221992,"urlname":"Cambridge-Black-Book-Club","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Knowledge Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Mount Auburn St.","name":"The Democracy Center","lon":-71.116272,"id":3900472,"state":"MA","lat":42.371239,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.49176168442,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1368912631000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a free meditation session, and an introduction to the Art of Living course, meant to bring people together for a few moments of perfect tranquility in the heart of Cambridge.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

I have discussed my passion for philosophy many times on\u00a0this show and will continue to share it as this radio program evolves. My guest, Jeannie\u00a0Connerney, is someone whose philosophic passion is as energetic as my own but in this conversation\u00a0we will see how the divergent paths of philosophy are at the root of much of its appeal.\u00a0In philosophy, the \"one and the many\" is a central concept, and philosophy is \u00a0itself a\u00a0mirror reflection of this core concept. Philosophy has common themes about seeking truth\u00a0and cogent reasoning in all areas but, within this commonality, there is enormous diversity\u00a0of opinion.<\/p> <p>Now, while I imagine, Jeannie and I may agree more than disagree, I am sure that points of\u00a0divergence will make for a great conversation that will--I hope--shed some light on the\u00a0nature of philosophy. Jeannie will talk a bit about her philosophical biography and we will\u00a0compare some notes as starting points in our discussion of philosophical convergence and\u00a0divergence. In the end, perhaps the idea of philosophy will become even just a little clearer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'd like to share some \"discussion starters\" that Jeannie provided me with:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How did you come to study philosophy?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What type of philosophy and which philosophers were you drawn to early on, and did this change?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Role of literature in coming to philosophy? Art? Politics?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Was there a role that religion played in leading you to philosophy? What do you think about religion now?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Valuable moments in philosophical education\u2014classes, professors, books, papers. Influences.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Who are the key philosophers in your life, and how did they influence you?Were there ideas that really excited you?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Philosophy can lead one both to and away from conventional morality or ethics. How is this good or bad?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Do you end up knowing anything after studying philosophy?\u00a0What is the value of philosophy, both individually and for society\/culture?<\/p> <p>\u2022 Discuss philosophical methods or methodology in general.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Are there philosophers you don\u2019t like or with whom you disagree? Why?I can't wait until Wednesday!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>******************<\/p> <p><br\/>Your RSVP indicates that you plan on listening to the show.

Our strategy and\u00a0channels have to change to match the new behavior.\u00a0 In this breakfast round table we will be discussing buyer concerns through their process and how sales\u00a0people must adjust and educate differently, and how marketers can help produce the content for sales people to use.<\/p> <p><br\/>.\n\u00a0Takeaways from the discussion will include:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0 When is the best time to \u201ceducate\u201d or \u201cre-educate\u201d buyers<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What\u2019s the value of a seller\u2019s insights and expertise in the buying process?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are the roles of marketing and sales in educating buyers ?<\/p> <p><br\/>Marie Warner will lead this discussion, drawing on her 9 years as a Chief Sales Officer, plus 15 years of consulting to large enterprises and startups helping to define and implement process in building and developing sales teams, and aligning B2B sales process with the buyer's journey.<\/p> <p>Bring your thoughts and join the discussion!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/events.r20.constantcontact.com\/register\/eventReg?oeidk=a07ebhr3rhw8b1981d8&amp;oseq=&amp;c=&amp;ch=\">Register here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>And look for updates on great SAMI free evening events to be added to this Meetup shortly.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're in the Riverbend restaurant at the back of the first floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sales-and-Marketing-Innovators\/events\/225301462\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Monthly breakfast discussion on sales and marketing","id":"225301462","time":1442489400000,"updated":1442501571000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441985357000,"name":"Sales and Marketing Innovators","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18921355,"urlname":"Sales-and-Marketing-Innovators","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Marketers, sales professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01801","country":"us","city":"Woburn","address_1":"15 Middlesex Canal Park Drive","name":"Scoreboard Sports Bar and Grill","lon":-71.1586,"id":10816172,"state":"MA","lat":42.496975,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":10.5088844299,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1356112109000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>BCG Networking Group is an exclusive business networking and referral group that meets once a month on the third Thursday of each month from 7:30am to 9:00am in Woburn, MA.<\/p> <p>Our membership group was founded in 2003 and is made up of local small business owners and business professionals that are committed to helping each other generate quality business leads.<\/p> <p>Guests are welcome, please contact Robert Dickey at[masked] to discuss visiting our Exclusive Massachusetts Networking Group<\/p> <p>Visit our group website at www.bcgnetworkinggroup.com<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Current Member Specialties:<\/b><\/p> <p>Accounting Solutions Architects, Designers, Planners Business Consulting Computer IT Services for Business and Homeowners Construction Company - Home Remodeling and Renovations Internet Shopping Franchise - Shop.com Investment &amp; Wealth Management Advisers Law Firm - Construction and Criminal Law Mortgage Broker Non Profit Fundraising Program Photo Organizing Solutions Printing Solutions, Ad Specialty Items and Branded Apparel Real Estate Consultant Security Systems &amp; Monitoring Social Media and Mobile Media Marketing Video Production and Multi Media Services Website Design and Search Engine Optimization Window Cleaning Services (Commercial)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.bcgnetworkinggroup.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BCG-Networking-Group-Woburn-MA\/events\/225281447\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Monthly Networking & Referral Group Woburn MA call\/email to schedule a visit","id":"qtcbbfytmbwb","time":1442489400000,"updated":1442510553000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1356108985000,"name":"BCG - Business Referral & Networking Group Woburn MA","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":6316902,"urlname":"BCG-Networking-Group-Woburn-MA","group_lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Jamaica Plain","address_1":"Stomy Brook MBTA Station","name":"The lawn across from Stony Brook MBTA (weather permitting)","lon":-71.104797,"id":23982521,"state":"MA","lat":42.317089,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.46379947662,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438701991000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us again this Thursday morning before you head out to work for a guided meditation of Scripture in the Jesuit tradition of Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading).
