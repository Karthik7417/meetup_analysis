The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north.

Each time we interact with another we make an exchange on the more subtle levels of our being and even after we physically separate from the other, energetic and emotional ties remain. Energetic cords are not restricted by space or time, so you can be connected to someone far away, a person from your past, or someone who is no longer living. The same we are attached with our old believe systems and programming.<\/p> <p>Your belief system is the actual set of precepts from which you live your daily life, those which govern your thoughts, words, and actions.<\/p> <p>Cords are a method of high speed communication and sharing energy. Healthy cords create a nurturing sharing of information and energy. Unhealthy cords can be a huge drain or a means of control. They are attached by mutual agreement, but there are lots of ways to persuade, trick, or con people into being corded. Often they were useful, but outlive their usefulness. The cord may have been very important. Anytime you are transitioning to a new stage or phase of your life and you feel there are things you need to let go of cord cutting is a very simple and beneficial tool to release!<br\/>Cutting a cord does not mean ending a relationship with a person or a believe system. It means releasing problems that repeat endlessly on the level of energy.<br\/>One of many benefit from cutting cords are growth, healing, release of toxins in organs\/tissues, to trigger the natural growth of healthy chakras, to positively change relationships, to embrace happiness and bliss; to see the glass as half full, increased creativity, to conquer the carnal self to unite with the higher self and to ultimately become an active participant in one\u2019s own evolutionary enfoldment.<\/p> <p>Class Fee is $25.00, if paid in advance, $30.00 at the door.<br\/>Larry Lambert will facilitate this guided visualization.<br\/>RSVP today to reserve your seat for this event.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If you are unfamiliar with the Crofton area GPS the Friendly's restaurant in Crofton, MD and as you enter the parking lot you will pass our building.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tranquil-Souls-Maryland-Meetup\/events\/227559924\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cord Cutting of Belief Systems or Attachments","id":"227559924","time":1451847600000,"updated":1451871100000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1408468055000,"name":"Tranquil Souls Maryland Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":16489602,"urlname":"Tranquil-Souls-Maryland-Meetup","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Enlightened Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21093","country":"us","city":"Timonium","phone":"(410) 252-3000","address_1":"2165 York Rd","name":"AMF Timonium Lanes","lon":-76.627563,"id":744837,"state":"MD","lat":39.443645,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":11,"distance":10.6452083588,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449815927000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let us join together for the new year!

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/227470273\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvcbhb","time":1452033000000,"updated":1452044846000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion Post #22","lon":-76.604248,"id":11655302,"state":"MD","lat":39.39748,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.48896884918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451724911000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Here's the scoop from Betsy101's web page:<\/p> <p>\"Lower impact Zumba Gold makes it possible for almost EVERYONE to Zumba!

Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie's, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob (Bichir), who's taking care of Minnie's while she\u2019s visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray (Roth), the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Dern).

Try waking up in a Maryland trauma center two months after being blown up in an MRAP (mine-resistant ambush protected) vehicle in Afghanistan. That's what happened to Adam Keys. An Army Sgt. in the 27th Engineer Battalion, Adam lost his best friend from middle school in the attack plus three other soldiers as they were working to keep supply lines open. He was given practically no odds of recovery by his doctors, but his mom, Julie, never gave up hope or the belief that Adam was still \u201cin there\u201d as he lay motionless in a hospital bed with a raging infection that would later claim three of his limbs in order for him to survive. A triple amputee, Adam and Julie will take us on a journey of self belief, positive attitude and struggle to overcome life\u2019s greatest challenges. All great messages to start off the year in 2016.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>The 1747 Pub downstairs from Reynold's Tavern at Church Circle in Annapolis is an excellent place for happy hour. It's a vibrant pub with tasty food and an open bar area with a warm and inviting fireplace that provides a cozy ambience. Their special on Wednesdays is half-price wings and $5 burgers.<\/p> <p>Our SHR group has visited the 1747 Pub several times and really enjoyed it. Let's give it another try!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Full details, directions, and reviews of the 1747 Pub below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:30 pm to hopefully find a good spot in the bar area.

These interests include, among others, Dominance &amp; submission, bondage &amp; discipline, leathersex, fetishism, cross dressing, and roleplay. BESS is multi-sexual. All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more. These meetings are open to all who wish to attend; there is a small fee for each meeting.<\/p> <p>For more information see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bess-md.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bess-md.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BESS-MD\/events\/226133674\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Educational Meeting!

Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

In 90 minutes you can only scratch the surface on how to design and create seamless composites. So we thought this would be a great subject for our very first weekend workshop!<\/p> <p>This will be a hands on class with the assumption that you have had experience with Photoshop, as well as layers and masks. If you are brand new to Photoshop, this workshop may not be for you.<\/p> <p>Denise Silva will lead the workshop in learning various ways to make selections in Photoshop and how to refine selections for seamless compositing. These techniques can be used to then perform many tasks, from replacing skies to making composite images. We will practice the techniques that are needed to build composites, including selection techniques, layers, masks, layer styles and more.<br\/>Denise will provide all the images for the practice, so that everyone will be working towards the same results. In this workshop, we will learn how to use layers and masks in Photoshop to blend textures and\/or other images together to create exciting composites.<\/p> <p>The workshop will also cover the various ways to combine multiple images\/textures and manipulate photos. Texture blending and image compositing allow you to blend multiple images (images with images, graphics or textures) to create new and wholly unique art. The combinations are limitless.<\/p> <p>Date: Saturday, January 9, 2016<br\/>Time: 10:00am \u2013 4:00pm<br\/>Location \u2013 TBD \u2013 Will depend on a majority of attendee\u2019s home location<br\/>Cost - $75<\/p> <p>We will need a minimum of 5 people to make the session possible.

And sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by the subjects partner.<\/p> <p>As growing photographers, what's erotic and how to capture that look is subjective. But as always keep the end user's (you or the clients) opinion the highest weight in that balance.<\/p> <p>In this workshop our goal is to provoke emotions and thought with \"Subject, Composition, Light, and Exposure\" for that wonderful shot. With all good results planning is needed to increase our shot success ratio. Many items make up a good image and it all starts with good communication, spiritually within the artist (don't shoot until you see it) and verbally with your subject.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our returning featured model <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelmayhem.com\/2298715\">Bailey<\/a> is coming in town from Boston to work with us again. And new to the The DMV Photographer Workshops but not new to some of us <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelmayhem.com\/2992453\">Alexis<\/a> will be joining us. Of course we will other models depending on participation. (And if the ladies sign up we will include a male model of course.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will create the scene, but the focus will be on \"parts\" of the model in the scene. (Again composition is key!) In some \"parts\" assignments photographers work with known viewers fetishes to bring out and provoke emotion for the art viewer; legs, shoes, hands, garters, handcuffs, rope, and so on. Some of these scenes will be done in our studio and outside to help give the final image the look and feel you were looking for. Then we will move into full scene story telling views, if time permits.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, here is another workshop opportunity to broaden your shooting selections while you work on becoming one with your creative balance.

Who will your meet?, where will you go? What questions will be clarified? What present day actions will best serve you as you go forward better equipped for the tasks at hand?

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life.

It\u2019s ok to put it on a bit heavier than usual, but it should be flat\/simple colors. Now is not the time to experiment with bold colors or new techniques.<\/p> <p>(4) If you have any doubt about what looks best bring extra shirts\/ties\/jackets to the shoot.

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/227597932\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvcbqb","time":1452637800000,"updated":1452650323000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules of this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides, is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aviationvelo.com\/\">Aviation Velo <\/a>(local bike shop in Linthicum) for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience.

With his entertaining, humorous teaching style, Dean Garrish makes learning to dance fun as he teaches two dance lessons and serves as DJ, playing mostly music to practice the lessons. When you enter, pay a cover fee of $10 and maybe get your ID checked. Every Tuesday she can, Marlene will arrive by 7:30 and set out a Meetup tent sign on the first table available so we have a central meeting location. However, since we are mainly circulating on the dancefloor, this is more of an \"on your own\" activity. The classes are structured so you can take lessons any week of the month; they are not cumulative. Singles are welcome and partners are not needed. In fact, couples seem to learn better by practicing with other partners as well. After teaching dance and competing for over 25 years, Dean has won, along with his wife, Dawn, 2 UCWDC World Titles, 6 US Open Swing Titles &amp; over 50 Top Teacher Awards.

We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Red Red Wine Bar on Main Street downtown is a nice place to meet for happy hour.

Welcome to Bianca, Marissa and Donna, and thanks to those who've become regulars. The December book sparked a lot of conversation.<\/p> <p>Since it doesn't seem likely to snow this month in Annapolis, we've picked a cold weather book to set the winter mood. The January selection is <b>Midnight in Siberia<\/b> by NPR's David Greene.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/4\/a\/600_444889226.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Midnight-Siberia-Train-Journey-Russia\/dp\/0393351874\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449544024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=midnight+in+siberia\">Amazon.com<\/a>: Far away from the trendy caf\u00e9s, designer boutiques, and political protests and crackdowns in Moscow, the real Russia exists.<\/p> <p><br\/>Midnight in Siberia chronicles David Greene\u2019s journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway, a 6,000-mile cross-country trip from Moscow to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. In quadruple-bunked cabins and stopover towns sprinkled across the country\u2019s snowy landscape, Greene speaks with ordinary Russians about how their lives have changed in the post-Soviet years.<\/p> <p>These travels offer a glimpse of the new Russia\u2015a nation that boasts open elections and newfound prosperity but continues to endure oppression, corruption, a dwindling population, and stark inequality.<\/p> <p>Midnight in Siberia is a lively travel narrative filled with humor, adventure, and insight. It opens a window onto that country\u2019s complicated relationship with democracy and offers a rare look into the soul of twenty-first-century Russia.<\/p> <p><b>Midnight in Siberia<\/b> is new in paperback, and is available in hardcover, Kindle and via the AA County Library.

If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter the building anywhere and follow the Columbia Insight Meditation signs to the room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/events\/227616375\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":5400000,"name":"Insight Meditation Class","id":"cjtwjlyvcbrb","time":1452731400000,"updated":1452738298000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334625474000,"name":"Columbia Insight Meditation Group","group_lon":-76.8700027466,"id":3684172,"urlname":"Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"740 Route 3","name":"Athletic Performance Inc","lon":-76.663811,"id":11010062,"state":"MD","lat":39.051575,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":16.6738166809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452484817000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>NEW TIME THIS WEEK ONLY - 9:30PM - 11:30PM \u00a0(pass the word to everyone)<\/b><\/p> <p>We will be running a small drop n play Wednesday night.<\/p> <p>We will be playing surface will be on an indoor turf.

Done incorrectly, humor can be a disaster. Executed correctly, humor lightens the load, eases the burden and releases tension. There are three basic methods for adding humor to a speech: Tell a canned joke, tell an original joke or simply make a wry observation.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Method #1: Canned Jokes<br\/>The beauty of a canned joke is that it has usually withstood the test of time. For someone just starting to add humor, this is the best technique. By telling an old standby, you can concentrate on timing and delivery \u2013 two of the major keys to being funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery:<\/b> This refers to the way you present a joke. These two ideas may be the most important aspects of humor. As Toastmasters, we know that communication is more than just words. When you deliver a joke, your attitude alone can make or break the punch line.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But you have to get over the idea that you have to be perfect. Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to laugh.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of our newer members served as Toastmaster for the first time. She opened with a joke, stumbling through it. Even though she had to read the joke and even apologized to us ahead of time for her lack of experience, she told the joke with a smile and a wink. We laughed!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Audacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears. Just say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m terrified. I might botch the punch line, I might forget the entire joke; maybe no one will laugh. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway. It will be hard this first time, but easier the next and the next and the next.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The basic keys to adding humor to your speech are:<\/p> <p>relevance, and<\/p> <p>unexpected insight<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say you were doing a talk about ESPN or sports fanatics or even just sports in general. You might try the following \u201cused\u201d joke:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cA sports-buff showed up at the sold-out football game. He took his seat on the 50-yard line and then gently placed a woman\u2019s coat and an extra ticket on the seat next to him. The spectator behind him asked, \u201cAre you saving that seat for someone?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man said, \u201cNo. It would have been for my wife, but she\u2019s passed on.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d the spectator said. Then he added, \u201cGosh, why didn\u2019t you give that extra ticket to a friend?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man turned around with a surprised look on his face and said, \u201cAll my friends are at the funeral.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This joke is obviously\u00a0<i>relevant<\/i> to a sports-oriented talk. It sets the theme of the speech and warms up the audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The <i>insight<\/i> is that we sometimes get so wrapped up in our own stuff that we forget about other people. We all do it. This guy just did it bigger and that makes it funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Try out this joke (or any other) on several friends. Practice timing the punch line. Try different wording to make it your own. Try out different pacing, pausing in various places for emphasis. Like any other skill, you learn to tell a joke by practicing. Most people who claim they don\u2019t know any jokes are simply saying that they haven\u2019t practiced any.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most canned jokes are generic and you don\u2019t have to attribute your source. However, if you are relating something specific to a certain comedian, you should give proper credit. Use your best judgment. You may want to say something like, \u201cAs Steve Martin so aptly put it: \u2018The new phone book is here! The new phone book is here!\u2019\u201d But don\u2019t start your joke with \u201cI got this off the Internet...\u201d Just launch into it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Once you become comfortable telling jokes you\u2019ve found from other sources, take your humor up a notch by trying out some original material.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Method #2: New Material<br\/>There is a basic three-point structure you can follow to create your own, original material:<\/p> <p>Come up with a topic,<\/p> <p>Add a premise, and<\/p> <p>Turn it around.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works: First, come up with a topic. For example, if you are a parent, you might want to make a joke about being a father or a mother. Here\u2019s a caveat. If you are a woman, don\u2019t choose the topic of being a father. The audience won\u2019t be able to relate through you.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cSometimes a witty observation will produce no more<br\/>than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye. That\u2019s enough.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Next, create a premise. Let\u2019s say you are making a joke about being a dad. Your premise might be that it\u2019s hard to be a dad. Or, that having kids makes men a bit stupid. Or weird. Or that having kids is scary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Comedy trainer Judy Carter uses those four specific words when she is training people to be funny. She calls them \u201cattitude\u201d words. When you are just beginning to experiment with writing your own material, it is best to stick with the basics:<\/p> <p>Algebra homework is hard.<\/p> <p>Skateboarding on the highway is stupid.<\/p> <p>Being a dad is weird.<\/p> <p>Being tall around toddlers is scary.<\/p> <p>The third part is the hard part. You have to bring in the unexpected. For instance, if you are working with \u201cskateboarding on the highway is stupid,\u201d and you were being serious, you might finish with how dangerous it is. For a joke, look for insight. Look for pain.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, let\u2019s look at a concrete example:<\/p> <p><b>Step one:<\/b> Choose a topic. Let\u2019s say you chose \u201cparenting.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step two:<\/b> Choose an attitude. For example, \u201craising kids is hard.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step three:<\/b> Create a twist. First of all, what is hard about raising kids?<\/p> <p>Maybe your answer is that you have to be more mature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, think of a way to twist that around to surprise the audience. Here is how I used this topic to open my speech on traveling.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cTraveling with kids is hard! You gotta be tough, you know?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We just got back from Disney World. We spent all day walking and it was hot and it was like, \u2018I need a drink of water, and \u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 and \u2018I need to go potty.\u2019\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, my six-year old put her hands on her hips and said, \u2018Dad, quit whining.\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery, Part II.<\/b> Practice makes perfect. Although great material always sounds like it is impromptu, it rarely is. With jokes, more than with anything else, practice is imperative. You have to practice until it sounds as if you are just making it up on the spot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Record your joke delivery and then listen. After a while, you will get a good feel for the pace. You will hear where the pauses work and where they don\u2019t. Along the way, you\u2019ll memorize the joke. It will also stop sounding funny to you. Don\u2019t worry; your audience has never heard it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In my travelogue about Florida, I tell a story about my five-year old.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cKids are wise, aren\u2019t they? My five-year old son played in the sprinklers at the park and on the ride back to our condo, he took off all his clothes. He got out of the car and everyone stared at him as he walked down the street, naked as can be. JoAnn and I were mortified, of course, but he just looked around and said, \u2018Well, at least I\u2019m wearing sun block!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This story stopped being funny to me a long time ago, but whenever I tell it, everyone guffaws.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Rule of Three<\/b><br\/>Three is an inherently funny number. Just make a list of three things. Throw out the last one and replace it with something outlandish. A word, a phrase. A dead fish.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s take the simple topic of sun block and play it out.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cSun block is weird. (notice the attitude word) My wife packs SPF 44. Sun protection factor 44. Do you know what that means? That means that we can stay out in the sun 44 times longer with it on. Where are we going anyway? The Mojave Desert? The Sahara? The planet Mercury?\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Acting Out<\/b><br\/>Take your humor up another notch...act it out. Now take your rant against sun block and play it out even further:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cHave you ever noticed that the companies that make sun block make bug repellent too? You have to have both because they make the sun block smell like Pi\u00f1a Coladas. Of course it\u2019s going to attract bugs. They\u2019re like \u2018Yeah baby! It\u2019s cocktail hour!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Surviving the Joke<\/b><br\/>If you\u2019ve practiced your jokes and bounced them off the right people ahead of time, you\u2019re sure to get some laughs. Even so, the day will come when the audience just doesn\u2019t get it. There are two ways to deal with the \u201cbomb:\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>One is the \u201csaver.\u201d Powerhouse speaker J.R. Ridinger sometimes gets going so fast and furious that he leaves the audience behind. His favorite saver: \u201cMaybe that one will catch you on the way home.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The other technique is to just keep on keeping on. One of my all-time favorite inspirational speakers once gave a sermon on sex. The funny quotes she told at the beginning left the audience speechless. She handled her choice of material like a true professional, never missing a beat, though I squirmed and turned a bit red.\u00a0<br\/>Listening to this professional also showed me how confidence and audacity can pull off a joke that a less confident person could never get away with.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Method #3: Wry Observations<br\/><i>Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.<\/i> \u2013 Mark Twain\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of the great masters of the witty statements, Mark Twain once said that electric lights were to humor as lightning was to wit. In other words, unlike a joke that has a story-line, natural wit usually comes out as a pointed, wry observation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Use the triple-A method to develop your ability to make witty statements. First, be\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ware, then add\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ttitude and\u00a0<b>A<\/b>llow yourself to grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Be aware<\/b> by understanding that humor comes from understanding shared experiences, especially painful ones. In order to fully cultivate your own sense of humor, you have to stop seeing your life as completely tragic. We all have troubles. Open your eyes and your mind and watch for the irony and the contrast in life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your attitude will help you be funny. Watch any great comedian, male or female. Some are gutsy and loud, some are meek and shy. You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Finally, allow yourself to be funny. Open your mouth and try. Toastmasters is the perfect place to nurture your inner comic. Occasionally you may tell a stinker. Get over it and try again. Progress only comes with practice in front of real people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You don\u2019t have to elicit a roar of laughter from your audience. Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye.\u00a0<\/p> <p>That\u2019s enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember that Toastmasters is a learning organization. Give yourself permission to try, and trust that your fellow members are either (a) wishing they were as brave as you and respecting you for it, (b) about in the same\u00a0<\/p> <p>place on the progress curve as you are and respecting you for it, or (c) re-living the time they first tried humor and respecting you for doing the same.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, get out there. Be yourself, be happy and be confident. Long after your listeners have forgotten the content of your speech, they will still remember how you made them feel.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Historic Oliver's Carriage house is located at 5410 Leaf Treader Way, Columbia, MD.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/events\/227330301\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters leadership and communication skills meeting.","id":"227330301","time":1452817800000,"updated":1452825225000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346087629000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4652422,"urlname":"patuxent-toastmasters","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"toasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":12.8690757751,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452225311000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A nice night for people to relax, laugh, and have a good time.

If your true goal is to elevate your vibration, this will do it. The 2nd time and probably the most amazing was getting the spheres to relieve pain. I was having joint pain and migraines. I was about to go on a 2 week vacation with lots of walking, so Jenn gave me the spheres and I didn\u2019t have any hip\/joint pain or migraines the entire time!! It was so good that I told her next time I travel, I\u2019m booking a session with her and asked that she also add spheres to my feet!\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cJenn is too awesome to put into words. Humble, sweet, and loving\u2026she uses these in Holistic Metamorphosis to be a catalyst for the change you seek. If you have tried Reiki, MDH, or other healing work and still need to dig deeper- definitely make an appointment or take the classes being offered. You won\u2019t be sorry. At worst, you will end up freeing some things which have been bothering you. At best, you will see a total transformation\u2026something that has come through for me as a result of the work Jenn has facilitated with me.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cI really did feel the energy from the spheres that Jenn does\u2026I was lying down receiving my session (Jenn is a wonderful intuitive and a great healer!) with my eyes closed and I could literally feel the heat above my forehead.\u00a0 I told Jenn what I was feeling and she said it was a sphere of energy\u2013and it was amazing that I could\u00a0actually\u00a0feel that with my eyes closed!\u00a0 I highly recommend Jenn and her new amazing healing modality!\u201d<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donut driveway","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/227396574\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":198000000,"name":"Holistic Metamorphosis\u2122 Foundation","id":"227396574","time":1452870000000,"updated":1453068918000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21401","country":"us","city":"Annapolis","address_1":"2002 Annapolis Mall","name":"Westfield Annapolis Mall","lon":-76.546112,"id":2334211,"state":"Ma","lat":38.987263,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.3321018219,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451963699000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There is a little bit of something for everyone at this playdate!<\/p> <p>Please Bring: A favorite winter recipe typed or written out, and a small snack item to share with moms and\/or children.<\/p> <p>We Will Provide: Coloring Pages and Crayons for the children, and Snack Bars for Moms.<\/p> <p>At the playdate, we will gather all of the recipes together, and everyone who brought one will get to take a different one home!!

My colleagues and I have been developing methods to simplify fabrication and macro-to-micro connectivity of these devices in order to overcome the specialized equipment needed to generate parts and to lower the barrier to widespread use of microfluidic chips in non-engineering labs. We and others have developed technologies to create microfluidic devices from cut-out laminates and double-sided tapes, which are cheap to buy in a variety of types and can be fabricated with more affordable tools (e.g. craft cutters, laser machines). We recently demonstrated the first microvalves in laminate devices and the ability to create 3D systems with folding (Lab on a Chip, 4, 2014). An agar-filled cube with microfluidic faces (shown above) was used to control the chemotaxis of nematodes when various faces of the cube presented attractants or repulsive chemicals. In the talk I will also discuss my past work using microfluidic devices to generate chemical gradients and to stimulate arrays of single olfactory neurons.<\/p> <p><b>Greg Cooksey is a bioengineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD. His research efforts focus on the development of devices to control and measure properties of biological systems. Dr. Cooksey earned his Ph.D. in bioengineering at the University of Washington (UW).<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BUGSS-Baltimore-Meetup\/events\/226860837\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Getting microfluidics to stick-A Talk by Dr. Gregory Cooksey","id":"226860837","time":1452902400000,"updated":1452911109000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374099370000,"name":"BUGSS Baltimore Meetup","group_lon":-76.5400009155,"id":9403172,"urlname":"BUGSS-Baltimore-Meetup","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Citizen Scientists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21202","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"201 East Pratt Street","address_2":"Harborplace- Pratt Street Pavilion, 2nd Floor","lon":-76.611392,"phone":"(410) 625-5900","name":"Uno Chicago Grill","id":1114679,"state":"MD","lat":39.286582,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.518671154976,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452360187000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's meet up over dinner and get to know one another...after dinner we could enjoy drinks some place or go shoot pool or do whatever interests everyone!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Indian-Professionals\/events\/227964060\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Meet and Greet","id":"227964060","time":1452902400000,"updated":1453265929000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451964772000,"name":"Baltimore Indian Professionals","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":19280191,"urlname":"Baltimore-Indian-Professionals","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Young Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":15.8250513077,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452043113000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In our first meet up, we will learn the 3 steps to manifesting anything you desire, through a short, interactive workshop, entitled, \"Transformation Now\". \u00a0We will do fun exercises to establish our new skills; do some goal setting; discuss an agenda and choose topics for future meet ups.

He made his recital debut at Carnegie Hall and, at age 16, made his concerto debut at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. Since then, solo concerts have taken him throughout the world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ashu's playing has been described as \"just as much fun to watch as it is to listen to.\" (Dallas Morning News) and \"Ready to cultivate the masses\" (Chicago Tribune). With a dynamic style that captivates audiences, Ashu has shown that the concert saxophone can reach beyond stylistic categorization and to a large diversity of people. While most audiences have never heard the saxophone in concert music, Ashu has begun to change this.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He has won many top awards, but for the most recent, he performed as concerto soloist at the renowned Musical Olympus International Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia in a program featuring saxophone concertos by Jacques Ibert and Astor Piazzolla with the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic. The Musical Olympus Festival is a week-long concerto festival featuring the First Prize winners of the top international competitions, including the Sibelius Violin Competition, Chopin Piano Competition, Queen Elizabeth Competition, ARD Munich Competition, Callas Grand Prix, Liszt Piano Competition, and more.<\/p> <p>At the festival's conclusion, Ashu was selected by audience vote as the winner of the festival's prestigious overall top prize (\"Audience Award\"). He will be presented with the award in a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City, where Ashu will again perform as concerto soloist with orchestra. The prize includes a valuable jeweled egg commissioned by the festival from renowned Russian artist Vladimir Mikhailov. He will also be invited to perform solo concerts in major halls in Zurich, Singapore, Azerbaijan, and more. \u00a0Among the festival's honorary committee are Daniel Barenboim, Valery Gergiev, Yo-Yo Ma, Yuri Temirkanov, Mariss Jansons, Montserrat Caballe, Zubin Mehta, and Placido Domingo.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/d\/1\/600_445346065.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/227582316\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Free Classical Music: Ashu","id":"227582316","time":1452904200000,"updated":1452983852000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","city":"Towson 21204","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"Towson American Legion Hall ","lon":-76.604248,"id":12117992,"state":"MD","lat":39.39748,"repinned":false},"headcount":150,"distance":7.48896884918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448735637000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person Cash or Check","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Brian's popular Band plays a great mix of East and West Coast Swing with a jump blues flavor that'll make you want to get up and shake your booty!\u00a0 You always ask us to \"Get 'em again!\" Note to West Coasters: Be There for BG.<\/p> <p><b>Friday January 15, 2015 <\/b><\/p> <p><b>8:00 - 9:00<\/b><\/p> <p>Chuck Alexander Teaches Beginning Swing to welcome our new people!<\/p> <p>Want to learn more swing and other Dances?<\/p> <p><b>Join February's Group Dance Classes!<\/b> Check February's Dance Class Schedule on the web page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fridaynightswing.com\">www.fridaynightswing.com<\/a><\/p> <p>February's Dance Classes will Start Monday February 1, Tuesday February 2, and Wednesday February 3 in Towson!<\/p> <p><b>9:00 - 12:00<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\"BG and The Mojo Hands\"<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Fee:<\/b> $15- Includes: Lesson, Refreshments and Dance with Band.

A trade and political alliance between the human kingdom of Gaur and the Kai kingdom of Bast-Haradis requires that he marry a Gauri woman to seal the treaty.

Resigned to her fate, she is horrified to learn that her intended groom isn\u2019t just a foreign aristocrat but the younger prince of a people neither familiar nor human. Bound to her new husband, Ildiko will leave behind all she\u2019s known to embrace a man shrouded in darkness but with a soul forged by light.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Two people brought together by the trappings of duty and politics will discover they are destined for each other, even as the powers of a hostile kingdom scheme to tear them apart.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>_____________________<\/i><\/p> <p>I hope to see everyone (and maybe some new faces) there!

It was suggested that I try to find a book with a male protagonist for this month. Unfortunately I didn't get any recommendations and couldn't find one. I did come across Pretty Girls, which sounded good though. I'll keep my eye out for books with male protagonists for the future. Happy Holidays!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b\/?node=390919011\">An Amazon Best Book of October 2015:<\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0Karin Slaughter's new stand-alone novel grabs you from the start and doesn't let go - even after you turn the final page. While taking a break from her popular Will Trent and Sara Linton series, but staying true to form, Slaughter presents readers with a new set of complex characters masterfully woven together in Pretty Girls, a psychological thriller about a family torn apart by (almost) unspeakable tragedy. From the mind-blowing character of Paul, to the sweet and sensitive perspective of Julia's father, Slaughter leaves nothing left to be desired. There were more than a few times while reading\u00a0Pretty Girls\u00a0where I stopped myself, mid-page, taken aback - not just from the dark and twisted storyline unfolding before me, but also by the realization of how much I was loving every word. This book is certainly disturbing at times, shocking at others, and scary enough to have you checking over your shoulder while you read late into the night, unable to put it down.\u00a0<\/p> <p>-- Penny Mann<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll have a small sign that reads Baltimore City Book Club","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-City-Book-Club\/events\/227562719\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's meetup and discuss Pretty Girls by Karen Slaughter","id":"227562719","time":1452970800000,"updated":1452982505000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1414187840000,"name":"Baltimore City Book Club","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":17841902,"urlname":"Baltimore-City-Book-Club","group_lat":39.3300018311,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21113","country":"us","city":"Odenton","address_1":"8274 Telegraph Rd","name":"CardBoard Gaming","lon":-76.694977,"id":15446832,"state":"MD","lat":39.096104,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":14.0140686035,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441794653000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gamers-of-CardBoard-Gaming\/events\/227610155\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":14400000,"name":"D&D 5e - Out of the Abyss","id":"grqpklyvcbvb","time":1452970800000,"updated":1452986477000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1406330045000,"name":"Gamers of CardBoard Gaming","group_lon":-76.6999969482,"id":15973912,"urlname":"Gamers-of-CardBoard-Gaming","group_lat":39.0699996948,"who":"Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Crofton","address_1":"1681 Reidel Road","name":"Crofton Community Library","lon":-76.67939,"id":24273698,"state":"MD","lat":39.013489,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.4079265594,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451425382000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Sarah Kaufman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Washington Post will visit the Crofton Library to discuss her book, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/aacp.ent.sirsi.net\/client\/en_US\/default\/search\/results?qu=art+of+grace+kaufman&amp;te=\">The Art of Grace: On Moving Well Through Life<\/a>.\" A recent <i>Kirkus <\/i>review said \"Kaufman studies the nature of grace and offers both an appreciation of it as well as a gentle exhortation to readers to cultivate it in themselves and the world around them.\" Book sale and signing to follow.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Books-at-Bars\/events\/227702107\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Author Visit and Signing -Sarah Kaufman","id":"227702107","time":1452970800000,"updated":1452982539000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403537387000,"name":"Books at Bars","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":15264472,"urlname":"Books-at-Bars","group_lat":39,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"11615 Little Patuxent Parkway","name":"Clarys Forest Pool","lon":-76.89608,"id":12945202,"state":"MD","lat":39.206238,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":13,"distance":15.8975658417,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452707246000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Nikki wants to lead a peppy (fast) dogs walk! \u00a0She is a busy working mom to Lily, (pictured below) and kitty Turbo. \u00a0Please give her a warm welcome and ask her to do more walks in the future!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/8\/c\/600_444392396.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>**Note: \u00a0Please bring adequate water for your dog.**<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Saturday is supposed to be partly cloudy &amp; 45 degrees with a 0% chance of rain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>There are multiple walks for Saturday so pick the speed that's appropriate for your dog. \u00a0This is a peppy (fast) dog walk :)<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Most of this walk is along the paved Columbia pathways; it is shaded and has a <b>lot of hills.<\/b> A short 1\/4-mile section will be along a street in a quiet neighborhood. \u00a0For any of our first timers, it's a <b>2-mile walk<\/b> along a shaded paved trail in Columbia's Clary's Forest area, which borders the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park.

coming from your church's worship service and need to pick up an item to contribute to the potluck.<\/p> <p>You can also pick up take out food - a bucket of chicken or side items, a few sub sandwiches of $5 footlongs from Subway, a carry out order of chinese food - you don't have to cook....although delicious homemade casseroles and salads are much appreciated!!<\/p> <p>Grace does not have refrigerators or microwaves (yet) that we can use to keep items cold or to heat them.\u00a0 Kitchen is coming soon, we hope!<\/p> <p>Usually there are 60 to\u00a075\u00a0single men and women\u00a0who
