We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.

The poets are the best ambassador of a people and it is through their voices that Sicily speaks to the world.<\/p> <p>Giovanni Meli is undoubtedly the greatest Sicilian poet of all time. Professor Cipolla who has already translated Meli\u2019s Origini di lu munnu, Favuli morali, Don Chisciotti and Sanciu Panza as well as many other single poems, has assembled an impressive anthology that includes most of his Odes, a sampling of the Buccolica and many other poems never translated before. This 356-page bilingual anthology (with the Sicilian and English translation on the same page) offers readers a wonderful opportunity to marvel at the breadth of Meli\u2019s interests and the depth of his learning, while savoring his wit, charm and wisdom. Giovanni Meli was called the \u201cperfect Sicilian poet\u201d by his French translator because he embodied the best of Sicilian values.\u00a0 Meli\u2019s poetry is a must for anyone who wants to understand Sicilian culture.<\/p> <p><b>&lt;a&gt;Friday, September 4th, 6:30 P.M.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Italian American Museum<\/b><\/p> <p><b>&lt;a&gt;155 Mulberry Street&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b><\/p> <p><b>(Corner of Grand and Mulberry Streets)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>&lt;a&gt;New York, NY 10013&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Suggested donation of $10 per person<\/b><\/p> <p><b>RSVP Code: Meli0904<\/b><\/p> <p><b>***************************************************************<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We can eat after at a local restaurant like we have done after so many other meetups at the Italian American Museum<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sicily\/events\/225028319\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Poetry of Giovanni Meli + (plus dinner?)","id":"225028319","time":1441405800000,"updated":1441541910000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1178522558000,"name":"New York City's Sicilian Food, Wine & Travel Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":495061,"urlname":"sicily","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sicily Lovers (Sicilophiles)"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1397687387000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please join a fun group of people who are interested in a diverse mix of strategy, card, and party games. \u00a0We play games such as Ticket to Ride, Avalon, Hanabi, Pandemic, Tzolk'in and many others.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We encourage you to bring your own games; there are always people looking to learn something new, as well as find a new favorite board game.<\/p> <p>Mass Transit to this location is available by taking the Q54 bus or by the E-F-M-R train stop at 71st-Continental Ave then to the Q23 bus.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can purchase drinks, foods, and snacks, so please refrain from bringing outside food and drinks.\u00a0 We want this restaurant to enjoy our presence!\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you're looking to play fun games with a really nice group of people, come meet up with us.\u00a0 Newcomers are always welcome!<\/p> <p><b>If you want to join our board game facebook group to get the latest news on board games, hot deals on games, buy\/sell games or simply just to connect with other gamers, please join us here:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/queensboardgames\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/queensboardgames\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/queensboardgames\/<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/queens-boardgames\/events\/224202258\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":16200000,"name":"Friday Night Boardgaming in Forest Hills","id":"dxkbjjytmbgb","time":1441405800000,"updated":1441423787000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1263320421000,"name":"Queens Board Games Meetup","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":1581333,"urlname":"queens-boardgames","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Fun Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Exact Location on Ticket","name":"MMOA","lon":0,"id":24068690,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.81869387627,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441218221000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/d0CnAocPSd63W0i07md0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/d0CnAocPSd63W0i07md0<\/a><\/p> <p>Tickets:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/3fDPiR\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/3fDPiR\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/goo.gl\/3fDPiR<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>You want a highly-academic, highbrow tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art where we stand before the great masters, contemplating their skilled use of line and form, while simultaneously placing them in the pantheon of other art historical geniuses, right?<\/p> <p>You picked the wrong tour.<\/p> <p>Welcome to Museum Hack VIP, our premiere museum experience.<\/p> <p>Perfect for a date night, an evening with friends or a capstone to a New York City visit, our famous VIP tour guides will show you the secrets, backstories and hidden nooks and crannies of the Greatest Fucking Museum on Earth.<\/p> <p>This \u201cby New York City residents, for New York City residents\u201d tour will show you the Met like you have never seen it before.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>*Please remember that this Meetup listing may not have accurate information - the people who have RSVPed may not have PAID\/SIGNED UP.

Most, if not all are daytime images. Seldom do you find photographs of lighthouses from when they did their most important work-at night. With the advent of more sensitive image sensors developed over the past several years, newer cameras now allow for the emerging genre of nighttime photography.<\/p> <p>In October 2013 the first of what has now become a series of thirty lighthouse photographs taken under specific conditions was shot at the Dutch Island Lighthouse in Rhode Island. Under clear and darkest of dark nights during monthly new moon phase,<\/p> <p>I've since been able to capture New England lighthouses in a way not widely before seen. Through extensive research and with cooperation from Coast Guard authorities, local harbormasters and private landowners, in the past eighteen months the series called \"Stars and Lights\" has expanded from Rhode Island lighthouses to those throughout Southern New England.<\/p> <p>I'm currently researching Connecticut's Long Island Sound lighthouses and will begin shooting those in the coming months as well as the remaining eastern Massachusetts lights to Provincetown.<\/p> <p>Since the start of this project several local lighthouses have been turned off and it is my intent to venture further throughout the region and beyond to capture more before many of these iconic structures are darkened.<\/p> <p>This project is much more complicated than simply arriving at a location and snapping a picture. One can view plenty of daytime photographs to get a more defined idea of the terrain, but once the sun sets, the area takes on a different look. Conditions one might not consider while shooting during the day include the amount of ambient light from nearby sources, i.e, streetlights; neighboring security cameras; industrial light pollution; light pollution from nearby cities.<\/p> <p>Another compounding factor in shooting lighthouses is whether the lighthouse is land-based or water-based. For the former, gaining proper access to the property is paramount as the photography will take place in the middle of the night and arousing suspicious neighbors might be detrimental.<\/p> <p>As for the latter, I've had a special twenty-foot aluminum tripod built to be able to shoot water-based lighthouses. Most were typically placed near shallow waters and prior to heading to these areas extensive research must be done for safety, not only for the boat but for personal safety as well. Additional compounding factors for water-based lighthouse photography are tides, wind, and sea conditions.<\/p> <p>This project has taken on a life of its own most who view the work are intrigued by the serenity of the images taken in the middle of the night with nothing around but a wonderful setting, a beautiful lighthouse, and billions of stars. It's difficult work and the motivation is to capture as many working lighthouses that we have left before we lose too many more.<br\/>\u00a0\nBrowse <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adelanteartistsgallery.com\/david-zapata.html\">David Zapatka's<\/a> work <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adelanteartistsgallery.com\/darkest-of-dark-nights.html\">HERE.<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adelante-Gallery\/events\/225101150\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"See fantastic photographs by David Zapatka.

California beckons, and I will soon be leaving my beautiful village, with a VERY big lump in my throat. But first, we have 2 more movie nights to share together.<\/p> <p><br\/>It\u2019s been an ENORMOUS privilege for me to produce nearly a decade\u2019s worth of free movies on the first Friday go every month at Piermont Public Library. I have enjoyed every screening, every movie, every Q&amp;A and every private conversation we\u2019ve had after movies or on email. While Jessica Bowen, our wonderful librarian, and I discuss the future of this film series (we both would like it to continue), I\u2019d like to invite you all to my last 2 film showings at Piermont Public Library.<\/p> <p><br\/>As promised last year, I will be showing you the last 2 films in the fantastic\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Before Sunrise<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0series \u2014 tracking the improbable relationship between Jesse and C\u00e9line through life. We left off last summer with the incredibly tantalizing and romantic cliffhanger ending of BEFORE SUNSET. A final film, BEFORE MIDNIGHT, was released 2 years ago and it may be even more astonishing that its two predecessors.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>So next Friday, Sept 4, I\u2019ll be screening both films in a row \u2014 with a special 6 pm start for the first film, and, courtesy of the Library and Jung Kim, the classic French cocktail Pastis both at the start of the evening, and between the two films.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Here\u2019s the running order on Friday, Sept 4<\/p> <p><b>6<\/b><\/p> <p><b>pm: cocktails, and BEFORE SUNRISE (reprise)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>7:30 pm: more cocktails\u2026 and the finale BEFORE MIDNIGHT<\/b><\/p> <p>And after the movies\u2026 you will surely want to discuss all that you have seen. Our post-screening Q&amp;As are always my favorite part of the evening.(Here\u2019s the trailer:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=euOJkb0U8vE\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=euOJkb0U8vE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=euOJkb0U8vE<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0)<\/p> <p><br\/>(Our grand finale will be Friday, October 2, and I\u2019ll show again the VERY FIRST film we had in our series, the wonderful Stanley Tucci movie BIG NIGHT.)<\/p> <p><br\/>So please join me Sept 4 for this special film evening. We\u2019ll wind down the summer, and start to wind down this film series, in style!!<\/p> <p><br\/>Thanks for making our series such a wonderful community success!<\/p> <p><br\/>Warmly,Marc<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcfarre.com\/\">www.marcfarre.com<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rockland-Social-Group\/events\/224956265\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Piermont Library - 1st Friday Movie","id":"qjvzjhytmbgb","time":1441409400000,"updated":1441422177000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1276326506000,"name":"The Rockland Social Calendar","group_lon":-74.1100006104,"id":1659920,"urlname":"The-Rockland-Social-Group","group_lat":41.1300010681,"who":"Event Organizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07512 ","country":"us","city":"Totowa","phone":"973-890-9699","address_1":"300 Route 46","name":"46 Lounge","lon":-74.22309,"id":1007588,"state":"NJ","lat":40.89217,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.6852788925,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439648837000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/3\/6\/600_440370262.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Come Join Us For \"A Labor Day Patio Party\" With A Free Hot Buffet, Drinks Specials, DJ &amp; Dancing.

It is time to hike and run on some real mountains!<\/p> <p><br\/>I can pick you up in NYC and we'll carpool all together in our RawMobile. As you can see, the number of spots is very limited, so first come first serve. The details about pick up and drop off are below. To reserve a spot just RSVP to this meetup.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/c\/d\/600_440793485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our recent day trips to the Catskills were awesome, so we're doing it again. Some folks were running, some were hiking, but all had fun and made new friends. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/past\/?scroll=true\">our photos and comments from the past trips.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There are lots of ways to enjoy a day at North-South Lake Campground, but the main point of interest to us is probably the <b>famous Escarpment Trail<\/b>. If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not doing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/7\/4\/600_441415156.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- lake swimming (in the designated area),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Continue along the Giant Ledge-Panther-Fox Hollow Trail gives you the opportunity to climb Panther Mountain, enjoy several views along the ridge and then travel down through Fox Hollow for a total hike of just under eight and a half miles.<\/p> <p>\u00a0This gets the majority of the climbing out the way in the first three or so miles and allows for a pleasant ridge walk across Panther and then a long descent into Fox Hollow.\u00a0 It also reduces the vertical climb required (the Giant Ledge Trailhead is located at a higher elevation) and leaves the steepest sections of trail for the descent. From the Giant Ledge Trailhead to the Fox Hollow Trailhead, the total hiking distance is 8.2 miles.\u00a0 The elevation difference between the Giant Ledge Trailhead at the summit of Panther is about 1400 feet and the descent from the summit of Panther Mountain to the Fox Hollow Trailhead is about 2200 feet for a total gain and loss of 3600 vertical feet in this hike. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Due to the steep climbs to Giant Ledge, to the summit of Panther and the descent into Fox Hollow, this is a strenuous hike, especially when considering the distance covered. \u00a0 Begin at the Giant Ledge Trailhead.\u00a0 Here the yellow blazed Phoenicia - East Branch Trail, descending down County Route 47 leaves the road turning east and beginning to climb to the notch between Slide Mountain to the south and Giant Ledge to the north.\u00a0 After crossing a small bridge near the road, the trail ascends slightly, passing a kiosk and a trail register (be sure to sign in ).\u00a0 Past the kiosk the trail becomes steeper and begins to climb to the notch.<\/p> <p>For the next 0.6 miles the trail ascends steadily in moderate to strenuous grade.\u00a0 The trail then begins to level off before reaching the trail junction with the blue blazed Giant Ledge-Panther-Fox Hollow Trail.\u00a0 For the Giant Ledge and Panther Hike, turn left here.\u00a0 Ahead the Phoenicia East - Branch Trail begins descending and about 2.7 miles reaches the Woodland Valley State Campground.<\/p> <p>After turning on to the Giant Ledge-Panther-Fox Hollow Trail, the trail, gently at first, begins climbing to Giant Ledge.\u00a0 The trail quickly becomes steeper and the climb more strenuous.\u00a0 After about three quarters of a mile, the first view of Giant Ledge is reached (about 1.45 miles from the trailhead).\u00a0 Giant Ledge is not a single \"giant\" ledge, but a series of openings on a long escarpment that offers views to the southeast, east and northeast.\u00a0 There are at least three outstanding viewpoints in short order.<\/p> <p>Passing the views of Giant Ledge, the descends slightly to the col between Giant Ledge and Panther Mountain in just less than a mile.\u00a0 From the col, the trail climbs steeply once again, passing another view on the shoulder of Panther before reaching the summit at 1.85 miles from Giant Ledge (and 3.3 miles from the trailhead). \u00a0.<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-DuRjhHvptNc\/U_DU3rhH0YI\/AAAAAAAABLo\/VezyDOtgSYI\/s1600\/IMG_1473.JPG&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-DuRjhHvptNc\/U_DU3rhH0YI\/AAAAAAAABLo\/VezyDOtgSYI\/s1600\/IMG_1473.JPG&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>;<\/p> <p>View from near the summit of Panther From the summit, the trail follows the ridgeline of Panther Mountain while slowly descending.\u00a0 It is a very pleasant, high altitude walk with occasional obstructed vistas through the trees.\u00a0 About 2 miles north from the summit (roughly 5.3 miles from the trailhead), there is the last vista on the Panther ridgeline.\u00a0 From this point the trail begins to descend more steeply and then very steeply descends as its drops off the shoulder of Panther Mountain into Fox Hollow. \u00a0 This is a steep descent, especially after almost 6 miles of hiking.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>After steeply descending from the shoulder of Panther Mountain, at 7.9 miles the trail passes the side trail to the Fox Hollow Lean-to.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;

It will be at a moderate pace, and we will stop as needed. It could be a demanding hike for some. We will stop a reasonable number of times. If you are looking for a high intensity workout or a slow stroll this is the wrong hike. Leader determines the pace, mileage number of stops, and duration of stops. If you want to run, do not come. Bring at least 3 quarts of water your lunch and wear hiking boots. If all goes well we will take the RD to the BD, the BD to the K, the K to the WB, the WB to the T, the T to the RD, and the RD to the parking lot. Rain cancels. No swimming and no dogs. Trans. 1C Tuxedo Orange CO. Bus Riders are always welcome. There is no need to let me know you are coming by bus. , but if you have any questions about the hike feel free to call or e-mail me. Bus riders take the 8:30 Shor t Line bus from PABT NY which Arr. 9:19. Buy a one way bus ticket. The short line ticket office is on the second floor of the North Building of the PABT. The bus usually leaves from gat 813. Drivers meet in in the commuter parking lot just passed the RR tracks on East Village road. .

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2015<\/p> <p>\n\n\"I have tried many different forms of meditation and yoga over the years. Though I have experienced some positive changes practicing over the years I never felt committed to practice on regular basis. Nan takes it to a whole other level. How and why? All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy. Open your mind and see with a different set of eyes. I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0My first time today. Nan is very helpful and dedicated. I enjoyed it immensely and I did experience a shift in energy. I feel more alert, relaxed and focused even as I write this testimony. I plan on attending her next class in Freeport.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class September 17, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time.\u00a0\u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>\"I have been attending these classes for three weeks. They are amazing. Nan is wonderful! My energy level is shifting and I am beginning to experience an ongoing sense of well-being with balance and relaxation. Highly recommend!\" Kathleen, Bodhi Meditation class October 25, 2013<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nBetween May 14,2013 and October 2014 over 2,500 people attended our classes in NYC and Long Island.<\/p> <p>The Saturday class is for a small group. Up to 8 people.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCome and experience how this unique meditation can help you purify your body\/mind and unleash the creative power within you.<\/p> <p>* Increase self-awareness<\/p> <p>* Stronger emotional intelligence<\/p> <p>* Greater mental clarity, focus and inspiration.<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation<\/p> <p>Energize your body<\/p> <p>Strengthen your mind<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is a form of energy healing.<\/p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is unique in the following ways<\/p> <p>1). It channels universal energy rather than working with what\u2019s within one person. It transcends the genetic and physical limits of just one being by relying and drawing energy from the entire universe.<\/p> <p>2). The entire human body is the receiver of this energy. The energy\u2019s effects on the body do not rely on certain meridian paths or pressure points of the body, which are the common requirements for many types of the Qi Gong practices.<\/p> <p>Students will experience two forms of Bodhi Meditation.<\/p> <p>* Seated<\/p> <p>* Movement<\/p> <p>Your class instructor is Nan Ni Gilbert. Nan is a NYS licensed acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist. Nan is also one of the most advanced Bodhi Meditation energy healer in North America.<\/p> <p>Feel free to ask Nan your personal health questions after the class.<\/p> <p>Please arrive early for class intro\/setup.<\/p> <p>Class basic info:<\/p> <p>* Loose fitting clothes is recommended but not required.<\/p> <p>* Some people bring their own yoga mat for the seated meditation part. This is not a requirement as we have chairs for everyone.<\/p> <p>* Cellphones needed to be turned off during the class.<\/p> <p>Here is the internet link if you are interested in purchasing the meditation music used in the class.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\">&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bodhimeditationsociety.org\/digit-audios\/?PHPSESSID=bdc7699b94b966a513c5c67e7cfc8ed1\"&gt;<\/a>\u00a0----------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI leave you with Master JinBodhi's Golden Words:<\/p> <p>(Editor's note: The following phrases were suggested by Master JinBodhi and subsequently introduced to his students as a daily practice.

What that entails basically is greeting people and introducing yourself and educating them as to who we are and what we do as an organization. You MUST BE WEARING an Oath Keepers t-shirt or polo shirt while working the booth. We want to project a professional image and the head of the NYS Oath Keepers has asked that we dress appropriately.<\/p> <p><br\/>Unfortunately we are only given three free passes so anyone that does come to help will have to purchase a ticket to the fair in the sum of $16. The fair is a great place to bring the kids for the day, it is set in historic Richmond Town on Staten Island. They have rides, a petting zoo, games, vendors...it is a lot of fun for the little kids as well as us big kids. If you are able to help out please RSVP this posting.

We're heading north to camp out in the Adirondacks expansive Cranberry Lake State Park.<\/p> <p><br\/>This gem of a place is hidden away from the touristy attractions that drive other campgrounds, but the isolation is worth it. It's a piece of nature that feels like it is just for us, where hiking, fishing, swimming, and boating abound just a few feet outside of our tents. This is how life should be.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Plan ...<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll arrive Saturday afternoon at the campground office to check in and head to our camp area to set up our tents and other gear. From here we can do as much or as little as we'd like. In the evening we'll cook and have a communal meal over an open fire, and spend the rest of the night doing the usual camping activities -- partaking in adult beverages and stuffing our faces with snacks, playing games, and shooting the breeze.<\/p> <p>Sunday we'll get up and make breakfast, then the day is ours to play as we wish. In the evening we'll do more campfire cooking, socializing, and merry making until we nod off.<\/p> <p>Monday we awake to enjoy out last meal together, break down our campsites, then head home.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost ...<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$22.91 per person, click HERE to\u00a0pay.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Cost is for <b>TWO<\/b> nights of camping, checking out on Monday.

We will be cooking dinner Saturday; breakfast\u00a0 and dinner Sunday; and breakfast Monday and it will be semi-communal, meaning bring what you would like to eat for yourself but perhaps also enough to share with a few other people. Simple to cook but interesting items are best.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What else do I need to know?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 When you RSVP, please comment if you have camping gear to bring (tent, sleeping bag, etc.).<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>I've reserved two lakeside campsites.<\/b> Each site has a fire ring or fireplace with grill for cooking and a picnic table.<\/p> <p>\u2022 I'd suggest buddy-ing up to save hauling space\/equipment costs.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

American secret agent Devlin (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/cary-grant-p28204\">Cary Grant<\/a>) is ordered to enlist the libidinous Alicia's aid in trapping Alexander Sebastian (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/claude-rains-p58546\">Claude Rains<\/a>), the head of a Brazilian neo-Nazi group. Openly contemptuous of Alicia despite her loyalty to the American cause, Devlin calmly instructs her to woo and wed Sebastian, so that that good guys will have an \"inside woman\" to monitor the Nazi chieftain's activities. It is only after Alicia and Sebastian are married that Devlin admits to himself that he's fallen in love with her. The \"MacGuffin\" in this case is a cache of uranium ore, hidden somewhere on Sebastian's estate. Upon discovering that his wife is a spy, Sebastian balks at eliminating her until ordered to do so by his virago of a mother (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/madame-konstantin-p39070\">Madame Konstantin<\/a>). Tension mounts to a fever pitch as Devlin, a day late and several dollars short, strives to rescue Alicia from Sebastian's homicidal designs. Of the several standout sequences, the film's highlight is an extended love scene between Alicia and Devlin, which manages to ignite the screen while still remaining scrupulously within the edicts of the Production Code.

You will feel more relaxed and peaceful as Divine energy is channeled to everyone simultaneously.<\/p> <p><i>What is Reiki energy healing?<\/i><\/p> <p>Reiki is a simple way of channeling high vibration energy for healing purposes for ourselves or others. It clears blockages in our energy channels so that our physical body can be healthier. The practitioner does not use his\/her energy, but is just a channel through which the energy flows. Reiki Tummo goes beyond traditional Reiki in that it is not just a healing modality, but also helps us to grow spiritually by opening our spiritual heart which is our connection to the Creator. Reiki Tummo also uses kundalini and earth energy for a deeper and gentler acceleration of cleansing and spiritual growth.<\/p> <p><i>What else do I need to know?<\/i><\/p> <p>Donations are gratefully accepted, but if you can't donate please feel free to come.

Each month a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed and debated. This group, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Freemasons.<\/p> <p><b>Study Topic<\/b><br\/>September's topic will be conducted by Brother Janet Castro on a study of Freemasonry: The Art of Impressionism: Is progress linked to breaking out of established thought patterns? After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.<\/p> <p>Impressionism is a French art movement that emerged in the late nineteenth century. Its influence spread throughout Europe and eventually the United States. It came from the disagreement and reaction of some artists against the classical themes and artistic formulas imposed by the French Academy of Fine Arts, and sponsored by the official Paris Salon exhibitions. At the time, science started to realize that what is perceived by the eye and what the brain understands are two different things. The Impressionists sought to capture the former. It is said that \u00c9douard Manet established the freedom of expression principle of an artist before an object, by not representing it on a \"mystical\", \"elevated\" or traditional theme. This concept, still undeveloped, is the basis and foundation of modern art. What do Masons think about the principles of Impressionism, about the revelry against the ideological foundation of the Paris Salon? Is thinking \"out of the box\", like the Impressionism at the time, nothing but a revolutionary idea, or is it fundamental for innovation and social Rebirth?<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education. We further embrace the concept of a community environment, where ideas can be shared and debated in an open forum. From the seven liberal arts to the arcane, we seek to gain and to share the knowledge that is the legacy of mankind.<\/p> <p><b>More Resources<\/b><br\/>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Facebook:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Learn more about Freemasonry: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City\/events\/220792031\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"The Art of Impressionism: Is progress breaking established thought patterns?","id":"220792031","time":1441477800000,"updated":1441489918000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1378747138000,"name":"Freemasonry for Men and Women in New York City","group_lon":-73.8099975586,"id":10179932,"urlname":"Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"72nd and 5th ","name":"Current place: Right in front of the Morse Statue, at the benches.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with 6x12 Goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Renowned documentarian Stanley Nelson masterfully assembles rare archival footage that contextualizes the history of the Panthers \u2013 begun in response to racism and police brutality. THE BLACK PANTHERS does not hesitate to critique its subject, nor does it shy away from judging the corrupt activities of J.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness.

the Court Tree Collective in Brooklyn. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhat types of things will you cover in this class?<\/p> <p><br\/>- It is my hope that you will leave the classroom with the knowledge and understanding necessary to be able to cook confidently on a regular basis. \u00a0The purpose of this class is to alleviate the notion that cooking requires too much time, a luxury that few of us can afford to waste. \u00a0This class will provide a number of fast, simple, and relatively inexpensive options, as well as give home cooks the resources they need to be able to cook more often, regardless of their schedule. \u00a0Recipes will be reinforced by ideas, techniques, and resources, and will be supplemented by materials that you will be able to take home with you the next time you're not sure what to cook, or how to cook it. \u00a0We will help treat the problem of indecision as well as use shortcuts, and creative use of storage and leftovers to our advantage.<\/p> <p><br\/>Where will this be taking place?<\/p> <p><br\/>- \u00a0Classes will be held at the Court Tree Collective in Brooklyn. \u00a0It is at 371 Court Street on the second floor, right off the Carroll St. stop on the F and G trains.Directions are <a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/4V5ck\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWhat types of things will we cook?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n- We'll be cooking a few different protein\/vegetarian options that can be used to make a multitude of \"derivative dishes\" for your lunch and\/or dinner throughout the week. \u00a0Additionally, we'll be making several side dishes. \u00a0The menu will be as follows (keep in mind this may be subject to change due to time allotment):<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Apple Braised Pork Shoulder<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Sliced Pork with Broccoli Rabe, Apples, Smoked Pork Fat<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Pulled Pork with Carolina BBQ Sauce, Serrano Chiles, and Celeriac Remoulade<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Pork Cincinnati Chili Three

per person. \u00a0I have tried my best to keep costs to a minimum, however this fee is necessary in order to pay for the space, food, equipment, and teaching materials. \u00a0It is 100% my goal to give you the most bang for your buck, and will be packing as much content as I can into our time alotted, and will be distributing teaching materials that you can bring home with you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The $10 fee can be paid for via credit card through meetup, or via paypal\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=8WJUMJYMHMBP8\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Alternately, the fee can be paid for in cash at the door as attendance is taken.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI am very excited to be able to offer you these classes at a reasonable cost, and will be counting on your input for more classes in the future. \u00a0This looks to be an exciting new chapter for our group, and certainly an amazing opportunity to continue learning and keep challenging yourself in the kitchen. \u00a0If you have any questions, feel free to email me personally at [masked]. \u00a0I look forward to seeing many of you on September 5th, and hope this will be one of many interesting learning experiences to come.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thanks!<\/p> <p><br\/>Andy<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be on the second floor of the

The Temperance Movement, which had many women in its ranks, first urged the moderation of alcohol\u00a0 and then ultimately complete prohibition of alcohol. Later during Prohibition, the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol was illegal; however, there were many \"side effects\" of Prohibition, including the\u00a0many speakeasies (illegal drinking spots) that popped up. These speakeasies had unmarked doors that led to \"intoxication rooms\" with velvety interiors. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, a NYC mayor in the 1930s and 1940s,\u00a0once said, \"It is impossible to tell whether Prohibition is a good or bad thing. It has never been enforced in this country.\"<\/p> <p>On this walking tour, we will look at some of the symbols of the Temperance Movement in the 19th Century as well as talk about Prohibition speakeasies and the rise and fall of Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s. We'll stop outside of four or five faux speakeasies. <b>If we can, we will\u00a0go inside\u00a0a\u00a0faux speakeasy bar that was the site of an actual speakeasy during Prohibition. This speakeasy bar has the\u00a0d\u00e9cor and interesting artifacts from the Prohibition days of the 1920s. This will be at the end of the tour.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a walking tour with much commentary.\u00a0We'll be walking about 2 1\/2\u00a0miles. There will be plenty of stopping at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you. The tour lasts about 2 1\/4 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p>Below is an old photo of a slogan for the Temperance movement in the late 19th century.\u00a0This\u00a0photograph was taken in Thomas Edison's\u00a0movie studio at West Orange, NJ.\u00a0<i>(Source US\u00a0 Interior Dept., Nat'l Park Service, Thomas Edison Nat'l Historic Site)<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/f\/2\/600_439883794.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Below is\u00a0an article from <i>The New York Times<\/i>, August 26, 1887.

Around 90% of attendees are first timers so you won't be alone. Most people come solo and I encourage that. In a matter of minutes you'll be engrossed in a conversation with someone and then another and another and so on. Every 10 minutes or so I make the guys switch with the girls so everyone gets a chance to talk to everyone.

The 5.793 km circuit is the\u00a0fastest track\u00a0on the calendar.\u00a0Built in 1922, it has hosted the Italian Grand Prix every year since 1950, with the sole exception of 1980, when it was held at Imola.\u00a0The\u00a0cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights.\u00a0The flat out nature of the track also means that engines take more punishment than at most circuits with up to 70 percent of a lap being run at full throttle.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>STANDINGS -<\/b>\u00a0After winning at Spa, Lewis Hamilton has extended his lead to 28 points in the Drivers' championship. He leads the standings with 227 points while Nico Rosberg sits in second with 199 points and Sebastian Vettel in third with 160 points. In the Constructors\u2019 battle Mercedes still has a commanding lead of 426 points with Ferrari in 2nd with 242 points and Williams in 3rd with 161 points.<\/p> <p><b>TIRE ALLOCATION<\/b>\u00a0- Unlike last year, Pirelli will be bringing the P Zero White medium and Yellow soft tires (one level softer).\u00a0The lowest downforce set-up of the year used in Monza to extract maximum speed on the fast straights means that the tires have to provide all the mechanical grip necessary to get the cars through the corners.<\/p> <p><b>DRS ZONES<\/b>\u00a0- There are two DRS zones.\u00a0The detection point of the first will be just before Turn 7 with activation just after Turn 7. The second detection point will be just before Turn 11. The activation point will be just after the start\/finish line.<\/p> <p>After his redemption win in Belgium, Lewis Hamilton looks to win again and extend his lead in Italy. So can Nico Rosberg win in Italy and close the gap?\u00a0Can Sebastian Vettel redeem himself from his retirement at Spa with a victory? If you're in the New York City area and looking for some great racing action with other F1 fans, be sure to join us for the Italian Grand Prix to see who will take the checkered flag.\u00a0Race will start at\u00a0<b>08:00AM EDT<\/b>\u00a0with the pre-race starting at\u00a0<b>07:30AM EDT<\/b>. It's going to be another fantastic race.<\/p> <p>We hope to see you all!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/formula1NYC\/events\/224997183\/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"name":"2015 Italian Grand Prix","id":"224997183","time":1441539000000,"updated":1441646539000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1204496464000,"name":"Formula 1 NYC Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":1041504,"urlname":"formula1NYC","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Formula 1 Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":11.3540620804,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441067367000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come play some holiday weekend soccer.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/224633098\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytmbjb","time":1441544400000,"updated":1441938529000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1405265504000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This unlikely slice of city street is closed to traffic every weekend when dozens of vendors unfold their tables full of goods.

Total time is about an hour. This is a perfect hike if you are just getting back into hiking or if this is your first one. We'll take our time, no one will be left behind.

(I have also posted something for Friday evening September 4)<\/p> <p><br\/>We will cover most of the Park. I\u2019ll only stop very briefly a number of times to talk about what we see and I\u2019ll sometimes provide commentary as we move. We\u2019ll spend some time in the Ramble and we\u2019ll see the waterfalls in the North Woods and walk into the woods a bit for some excitement. We\u2019ll also be visiting a lot of other sites as well. Hopefully, you will see the Park like you never saw it before.<\/p> <p><b><i>WE WILL BEGIN BEFORE 10:00 A.M. BE READY TO GO.

Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails from Yahoo. (Contact me if you are a dues paying AMC Club member and don\u2019t get these e-mails and I\u2019ll tell you how). Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup events that I have led or are a chronic abuser of the RSVP process \u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up. PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED OTHER AMC MEETUP EVENTS.<\/p> <p>\u00a0I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 7:00 A.M.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Under no circumstance should you let the horse get away with that kind of behavior if you are sure that you can handle it.<\/p> <p>As you approach the horse to mount, walk tall and straight with your head up. Take firm, confident strides. Show the horse you are not afraid.<\/p> <p><i>Never<\/i>\u00a0let your horse walk past your shoulder; if he does back him up! His nose should be right at or behind your shoulder!<\/p> <p>If your horse is up to weight, don't feed him lots of treats.<\/p> <p>If your horse has a tendency to jump away or walk too quickly when you are walking him on the lead, make him run circles around you, using the lead to lunge him in a circle. If he wants to put more effort into misbehaving, make it your idea and MAKE him do what he wants to do, and then he will not want to do it anymore and will eventually realize it isn't worth putting so much energy into being silly for no reason.<\/p> <p>If you are really quite nervous around your horse and not sure how to conquer this problem, try making yourself yawn. This physically relaxes your system and outwardly displays a calm and casual appearance to your horse who will pick up on even the slightest feeling of nervousness. Another tactic is to actually laugh whilst in the saddle if you or the horse is afraid about something. Although it sounds ridiculous, it's amazing how much your horse is able to pick up on what feelings these actions are associated with!<\/p> <p>When feeding treats, don't let your horse be pushy or try to take them from you. Instead, hold the treat in your fist, and wait for the horse to stop nuzzling you or look away to give it the treat. This teaches them to respect you, and eventually they will not nuzzle for a treat.<\/p> <p>When your horse does the right thing, be sure to reward him or her. If you don't, the horse won't know what (s)he is being asked to do, and may keep doing the wrong thing because they think it is what you are asking.<\/p> <p><br\/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>HUDSON VALLEY HIKER LEGAL DISCLAIMER\u00a0<br\/>Waiver of liability\u00a0<\/p> <p>You agree when you sign up for this group or any of the events that you have read and understand the below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike (or any other event), and if you bring a guests with you, please understand that you are (as well as your guests) responsible for your own preparedness and well-being and will hold no one else liable in case of injury or mishap.

Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it.

We can exercise, and relax and embellish the \"melting pot\" diversity of our wonderful city. Our \"Who Are You\" format will give us all the opportunity to bond and be enlightened. As we picnic, each member will be given 10 minutes to tell the group about our childhood years, from ages 1 through 12. Where you were born, how you were raised, things you enjoyed, things you did not enjoy, your neighborhood and family life, etc. whatever you want to share. I know we will be fascinated by our similarities, and our differences. 10 minutes goes by very fast so I will bring my bell to ring when a persons time is up.<br\/>At the end of the \"who are you\" program we will have a question and answer format. At this time we can satisfy our curiosity about something that someone said. For example: Since you were raised in Montana....did you ever see \"big foot\"??etc.<br\/>After our be quiet and listen program we will continue on with general socializing. I am sure that we will have lots to talk about and we will get to know each other much better as we develop our friendships.<br\/>REMEMBER TO BRING A LITTLE SOMETHING TO EAT TO SHARE.

Though heavily fictionalized for our entertainment, both views were also popular in antiquity and were hotly debated by the ancients, especially during the Hellenistic Era (between the reigns of Alexander the Great and Cleopatra). There is a reason why the planets still bear the names of the Greco-Roman Gods and are thought to still influence our destinies!<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b>Hercules Invictus has been exploring the fringes of our reality throughout his entire terrestrial sojourn and has been sharing his experiences publicly for over four decades. He is proud of his Greek heritage, is an encounter prone individual, and he founded, among other things, the Regional Folklore Society of NEPA, the Center for the Study of Living Myth, and the Olympian Starseeds Initiative.

In\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/martin-scorsese-p110533\">Martin Scorsese<\/a>'s classic 1970s drama, insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/robert-de-niro-p17593\">Robert De Niro<\/a>) works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City, wishing for a \"real rain\" to wash the \"scum\" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone, Travis cannot connect with anyone, not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/peter-boyle-p82691\">Peter Boyle<\/a>). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/cybill-shepherd-p65168\">Cybill Shepherd<\/a>), who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/scorsese-p110533\">Scorsese<\/a>), the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny, a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate, Charles Palatine (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/leonard-harris-p30650\">Leonard Harris<\/a>), to violently \"saving\" teen hooker Iris (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jodie-foster-p90220\">Jodie Foster<\/a>) from her pimp, Sport (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/harvey-keitel-p37381\">Harvey Keitel<\/a>).

People in the streets are in panic mode and don't know what to do next and you are caught up in the terror and wonder what you should be doing now that the nightmare has really hit? If you know the answers to these questions and are prepared, you will have a much better chance to survive. If you do NOT, you're in deep, deep, deep trouble and will be coping with a situation that will be unbearable. Your worst fears are all coming true. Your very survival is at stake.<\/p> <p>Learn the answers to these and other important questions and you will be much more likely and able to ride out the storm that is headed this way. By all reports, some or all of this description will come true, and it is not a question of IF... but a question of WHEN! The best thing to do is to take action right now!!! This workshop will guide you through what preparations are necessary to do and what to get first. How to use your money wisely to purchase the most essential items you will need right away, and where to get them. A one hour round table discussion will follow the first hour workshop. Knowledge IS power! Find out what you need to know and tell your family and friends what they need to do. It may well be one of the most important conversations that you will ever have with them.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Big Picture: Art Director\/Graphic Designer, Creative Concept Designer, Think Tank Member, Futurist, Gay Rights Activist, Teacher, Truth Seeker, Paranormal Researcher, Ufologist, Spiritual Activist, Officiant, Life Coach, Writer\/Composer, Playwright, Actor, Voice Over Actor, Puppeteer, Director, Many television &amp; radio interviews. <i>(A full bio available upon request)<\/i><\/p> <p>Please plan to attend what is bound to be one of the most interesting DNNY meetings to date!

What implications does this have for our daily lives? Well, the general idea behind Consciousness Creates Reality is that you, as an individual, have the power to bring about your own reality. Above and beyond wishful thinking, the power of positive energy, and the law of attraction, Consciousness has the capacity to bring about real palpable changes within the physical world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>How is this possible?--you might ask. I posit that the same observer effect that impacts electrons impacts other forms of matter as well. Observation essentially means looking closely, paying attention, or being AWARE. By turning your attention inward to your thoughts and emotions, you become the observer to your own life's experiments thus altering the structure of reality around you, just as observing the electrons impacts the manner in which they behave.
