Soil\u2019s function is to supply plants nutrients and to anchor the plants\u2019 roots.

The CHA also is planning to feature our event sponsor The Capsule Consulting Group, a leading manufacturer of capsules targeted toward the cannabis industry to educate our community on the type of capsules that are out there, the variety of qualities, and how capsules will play a role in the mainstream acceptance of the delivery of cannabis as a medicine due to the familiarity that people have with them. Finally, NYC Councilman Jumanne Williams will be the keynote speaker discussing the current state of cannabis legalization in NY, its impact on New Yorkers, and what can be done to change it.<\/p> <p><br\/>OBJECTIVE<br\/>Smoking of cannabis, in fact smoking of anything is unhealthy. When it comes to medical cannabis, it is widely agreed by our state government, most Doctors, and medical professional professionals that the oral ingestion of cannabis is the safest consumption method to deliver the meds. Oddly enough, the NYS medical cannabis program does not include edible items. On March 8th, we will investigate the world of edible cannabis both from a food, beverage, and encapsulation standpoint along with get the point of view on cannabis legalization and our current medical cannabis program from one of our NYC Councilmen, Jumanne Williams.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/b\/6\/600_447219094.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/9\/5\/600_447219061.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>LIMITED TICKETS ARE AVAILABLE FOR NON-CHA MEMBERS.

The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We\u2019ve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, we\u2019ve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through \u201cmenial\u201d jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>How did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HR-in-Tech\/events\/228755877\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"Hr in Tech Book Club presents: \"Why We Work\"","id":"228755877","time":1457479800000,"updated":1457543688000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1377875970000,"name":"HR in Tech","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10036672,"urlname":"HR-in-Tech","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"HR Pros"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14198327065,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423014426000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i><b>At Toastmasters, members learn by speaking to groups and working with others in a supportive environment.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>A typical Toastmasters club is made up of 20 to 30 people who meet once a week for about an hour.

It is similar in structure to party games such as Mafia and Werewolf, where a small, secret group of informed players attempt to disrupt a larger uninformed group, while the larger group attempts to identify the spies and eliminate them. The Resistance uses slightly different mechanics from similar games, and was designed to avoid player elimination and increase available information for player decisions.<\/p> <p>MENU<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.doublewidebar.com\/blog\/menu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.doublewidebar.com\/blog\/menu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.doublewidebar.com\/blog\/menu<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>ATTRACTIONS:<\/p> <p>\u2022 The Resistance Game: Rules are shown above video<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/awesomeshit.ninja\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/the-resistance-game.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Jenga: Whoever cause Jenga to fall, buys drinks<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn2.bigcommerce.com\/server1800\/b23d9\/products\/40\/images\/202\/GENUINE_BLOCKS_option__47927.1436382752.1280.1280.jpg?c=2\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cdn2.bigcommerce.com\/server1800\/b23d9\/products\/40\/images\/202\/GENUINE_BLOCKS_option__47927.1436382752.1280.1280.jpg?c=2<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Food: There will be Food, It is Free if you win.<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/diaryofmystomach.files.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/mg_1412.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Drinks: There will be beer, soft drinks and water.

Since the publishing of the reactive manifesto, developers in all sorts of different domains have started using this more principled approach to building systems that remain responsive in the face of faults or changes in scale. They\u2019ve quickly built up an exciting toolbox of techniques, frameworks, and libraries that can be brought to bear on the challenges of build a reactive system.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The machine learning world has begun to notice this exciting development. Developers building these systems have huge amounts of data and tough problems. The reactive systems paradigm offers real answers for these problems.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This talk will introduce you to some ways in which reactive techniques can be applied to building machine learning systems. We\u2019ll explore the five components of a machine learning system in sequence, trying to understand how and where reactive techniques can be applied. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we\u2019ll be able to draw on technologies like NoSQL databases, Spark, and Akka to build these systems in a reactive manner.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Whether you\u2019re experienced with reactive systems, machine learning systems, both, or neither, this talk will help introduce you to the big problems and some of the exciting new solutions in the union of reactive and machine learning.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Jeff Smith builds large-scale machine learning systems using Scala and Spark as part of that builds Amy, the AI that powers x.ai. For the past decade, he has been working on data science applications at various startups in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. He is a frequent speaker, active blogger, and the author of \u201cReactive Machine Learning Systems,\u201d an upcoming book from Manning on how to build real world machine learning systems using Scala, Akka, and Spark.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Next to Trader Joe's","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Reactive-New-York\/events\/228791552\/","yes_rsvp_count":160,"name":"Reactive Machine Learning & Cassandra 3.0","id":"228791552","time":1457481600000,"updated":1457544413000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443173577000,"name":"Reactive New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18966042,"urlname":"Reactive-New-York","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"440 9th Avenue","name":"Hudson Station","lon":-73.995934,"id":1515372,"state":"NY","lat":40.753746,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.405046135187,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456156418000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/8\/b\/600_447052107.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>We're once again joining up with one of NYC's largest singles companies for their biggest event!

I pretty much idealized these two girls waltzed around the stage in pretty princess dresses. Little did I know, they were pool-playing, hard-drinking, cigarette-smoking badass bitches. I immediately started to smoke and learn pool. Although, I no longer smoke, I still love to play!

This is sound advice, but where do you put your logic and what's the best way to organize it?\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/trailblazer.to\/\">Trailblazer<\/a>is an architecture for Rails that answers these questions. It takes widely-used best practices, such as view models, form objects, and service objects, and provides clear guidelines for how to apply them along with a set of gems to make implementation easier. In this talk, Steve will give an overview of the major aspects of Trailblazer, walk through code examples, and share his experience using it on a project.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-rb\/events\/223864950\/","yes_rsvp_count":150,"duration":7200000,"name":"Ch\ufffdracter Enc\ufffddings, Trailblazer and OOCSS","id":"ljjpglyvfblb","time":1457481600000,"updated":1457490800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1295408332000,"name":"NYC.rb","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1768544,"urlname":"NYC-rb","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Rubyists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"520 Eighth avenue","address_2":"16th floor","lon":-73.99247,"phone":"646 623 3710","name":"Ripley Grier Studios","id":472925,"state":"NY","lat":40.75354,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":0.277162432671,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456360568000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will continue the class and continue what we started, learning new songs on the spot, getting some pointers on style, musicianship, and the voice itself.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'll bring music for everyone and you can get in a lot of singing while you help or be helped by the person next to you.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Discover how to approach and implement a Single Source Modeling BIM workflow in a complex design and construction project.<br\/>2. Discuss collaboration and communication strategies among design consultants, general contractors, subcontractors and fabricators throughout the coordination\/construction process.<br\/>3. Discover the return of investment of this methodology: time, efficiency, budget.<br\/>4. Discover the advantages of working on a single software platform and sharing strategies using A360.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPresentation Description: \u00a0<br\/>BIM continues to gain awareness. Everyone wants it, but nobody is quite sure why or what to expect. BIM is not a 3D model; it is a workflow, a process. Therefore, it needs to have a clear purpose and a determined role throughout the project. It is fairly common that this idea works just fine on the design stage, but when it comes to construction\u2026 we have a problem. Different subs, different BIM experience, even different software. Coordination gets in the way and BIM gets out of the way.\u00a0 The goal of this class is that you discover a new way of looking at BIM workflow in construction: Single Source Modeling strategy. Victoria is going to present several projects where this workflow has been implemented, the overall methodology and the pros\/cons of this approach according to the case.\u00a0 A lot of questions that come to mind from each perspective \u2013 either from the owner, the design consultants, the CM or the subs) \u2013 What?\u00a0 When? Where? Which? Who? Why? How? How much?\u00a0 This presentation will be focused on trying to respond to all of those questions. Also, as core concepts of this methodology, you will discover the importance of collaboration and communication. In order to make any project successful, these two concepts need to turn into strategies followed by an action plan.\u00a0 At the end of the presentation you will be able to have a clearer picture of what is BIM, how to efficiently implement it and what is the ROI for your project throughout its entire life cycle.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER:\u00a0 Victoria Molina, AEC Resource.<\/p> <p>After graduating as an Architect, Victoria Molina started her career at RAD Miami, working as part of the design team for hospitality projects in the Caribbean. Throughout different projects, she learned about the building culture of American companies as well as standards of design, construction and management.\u00a0\u00a0 Her passion for project management and interest in the construction development drove her to become one of the leading VDC Managers at AEC Resource. In the past few years, she has been working on several large scale healthcare projects, such as Fort Bliss Hospital Replacement at El Paso, TX. In this project, for example, she has worked together with Clark McCarthy and the USACE to successfully deliver one of the most important BIM projects in the US.\u00a0 With over 4000 hours of experience in coordination, she has developed effective communication and collaboration skills.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n******Can't attend? \u00a0Register for the webinar.*****<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/5273015147437399810\"><a href=\"https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/5273015147437399810\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/5273015147437399810<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-RUG\/events\/228006068\/","yes_rsvp_count":93,"name":"Single Source Modeling for Construction Coordination","id":"228006068","time":1457564400000,"updated":1457577044000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1211468071000,"name":"New York City Revit User Group","group_lon":-74,"id":1160431,"urlname":"NYC-RUG","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Revit Users"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.524105012417,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455983670000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You must buy a ticket to attend (early bird offer)<\/p> <p>According to Forbes,\u00a08 out of 10 small businesses fail in the first year!\u00a0<\/p> <p>A good brand and great skills are not enough.\u00a0With careful planning, starting and running your own business successfully is entirely possible - even in challenging times. \u00a0<\/p> <p>This lecture\u00a0focuses on what is required to start your own business and how you can make a little money go a long way by planning carefully and using proven strategies for achieving success.

Keeping the data flowing at RTR means the operations team tracks inventory status by barcode, finance keeps tabs on the revenue health of the business, product monitors experiments through pixel data, users see product recommendations, and so much more.<\/p> <p>DET aggregates many diverse internal and external data sources such as databases, log files, and apis into the Great Data Amalgamation called Vertica. Over time DET has transformed the ingestion architecture into a robust python framework that includes server creation, job description, and alerting. In the first part of the talk Anna will expound on the pros (and maybe some cons!) of this infrastructure and the future of this framework. In the second half, Monica will talk about how DET iterates rapidly using python to solve meaningful problems and provide proof of concepts on permanent engineering features.<\/p> <p><i>BIO<\/i><br\/>Anna Smith\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OMGannaks\">twitter<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anna-smith-338996b\">linkedin<\/a>)\u00a0and Monica Quaintance (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/QuaintM\">twitter<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/monica-quaintance-32396321\">linkedin<\/a>) are Data Engineers at Rent the Runway.

While the drivers helped in providing some common functionality for all frameworks (master detection, authentication, validation etc), they have several drawbacks. Frameworks need to depend on a native library which makes their build\/deploy process cumbersome. The need for bi-directional connections makes it hard for schedulers to run in containers or behind firewalls. The Mesos API is undocumented which makes it really hard for pure language frameworks to use off-the-shelf HTTP libraries to interact with it. This talk will give an overview of the new v1 Framework API that addresses the above concerns. In particular the focus will be on the motivation, design and implementation of the API, as well as pointers to reference implementations and examples for framework writers and operators.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p>Vinod Kone is an Engineer at Mesosphere working on the Mesos core team.

All it depends upon is everybody doing exactly what is required of them, exactly when and where.

He knew where everyone should be and what they should do. Such a perfectionist was Kubrick that he knew every theater his films were opening in, and the daily grosses. It's said that a projectionist in Kansas City received a phone call from Kubrick in England, informing him that the picture was out of focus. Is that story apocryphal?

Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears.

I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way she broke it down! I've done all this reading\/learning and no one does it the way she does. She made me so aware of where my inner conflicts lie and how to get rid of them. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it. Again thank you so much.\" - Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"Ayelet's guidance helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well.

By the end of this 8-week series, you will be equipped with all the necessary tools to make a seamless transition into the advanced level. *For those that register for Level 3, Levels 1 &amp; 2 are included as extra practice, free of charge, in your monthly package.*<\/p> <p>Sample Video: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b>:<\/p> <p><b>Adelante Studios<\/b><br\/>25 W 31st Street between Broadway and 5th Avenue<br\/>2nd Floor<br\/><b>Grand Ballroom<\/b><\/p> <p>Nearby Subways: 34th St Station on B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, &amp; PATH trains.<\/p> <p>*Can't find our room?

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

This confusion can cause city resources to be directed away from areas of greatest need when officials are pressured to reduce call rates.<\/p> <p>Since no one surveys 311 callers, we do the next best thing.

With Saturn now transiting Sagittarius it is appropriate to look at their interaction.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>In his lecture, Mitchell Scott Lewis will discuss that relationship and how these seemingly contrarian forces can best be used in a constructive and logical fashion to best achieve our goals.

We will focus on short stories, flash fiction, novels\/novellas, poetry, creative non-fiction\/memoir, with some participants having the end goal of putting together book-length manuscripts. This is a speculative fiction group so the work should be in the magical realist, surrealist, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. genres. American Gothic and poetic memoir would fall into these categories. This group is broad and is a good space to submit works that may not fall clearly into a set format. <\/b><\/p> <p>For the first group, please submit a 3-5-page sample and a mission statement\/end goal. I am putting together a shared Google drive to distribute the work to everyone who will be attending the meeting.<\/p> <p>We will follow stories, chapters from novels, poems, pieces\/vignettes, flash works that center around a shared world or set of characters so that we can support each other's progress throughout the process of creating either the finished manuscript or working on separate pieces. If you are already in a novel group, you are welcome to bring another novel or a different work to this meeting, but please don't submit a novel that is already being critiqued by a novel group.<\/p> <p>The format will be slightly different than the critique groups that utilize the Clarion method. Everyone will have the chance to participate and give critiques. When submitting a piece for the first time, the author will let us know what their vision is for the finished manuscript: approximate length, overarching themes, goals during the writing process, what their driving force is for writing this manuscript. When submitting the work for critique, the author will write three questions\/areas that they would like readers to focus on or special challenges they have had in writing. During the meeting itself, the critique process will follow the same rules of respect and constructive criticism as the other meetings. The only difference will be that everyone will talk in their own time: we will not go around the circle in the set fashion of the CM but will listen to critiques coming from whoever would like to speak. The author will be silent for the duration of the critique and then have the chance to ask the group any questions based on the comments they heard.<\/p> <p>Page count per submission and per meeting will be the same as for the other critique groups:<\/p> <p>7,500-word limit\/submission<\/p> <p>28,000-word limit\/meeting<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers\/events\/229211099\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":9000000,"name":"Blurring the Lines: New Multi-Format Critique Group","id":"bdmzqlyvfbnb","time":1457654400000,"updated":1457701197000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1278875895000,"name":"Brooklyn Speculative Fiction Writers","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1673851,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"writers of speculative fiction"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1394724239000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>*** \u00a0PLEASE RSVP ONLY IF YOU CAN COME ***<\/b><\/p> <p>Come join us at our weekly Thursday night meetings to craft, chat and general merriment.

Lux has always been a member favorite and if you've never shot her, you are in for a treat. She always give 110% and is very skilled at getting you the shot that you need with her posing so you can concentrate on capturing the moment.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight Shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned with possible fourth look pending time and amount of shooters. First, we'll start up with an implied\/nude implied bedroom look. With this look we'll explore the subtleties of implied and go for a more boudoir\/romantic style. The second look is a glamour nude setup. Lux will start off with clothes or a themed outfit and go into stages of undress. Last look is a bodyscape lowlight look.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>We have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. So, please\u00a0only\u00a0sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit to hold your spot. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is\u00a0not\u00a0held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. All deposits need to be received immediately upon signup or within 5 days of the shoot or we will have to fill the unconfirmed spot\/s ASAP or cancel the shoot (existing deposits returned) if the minimum RSVP is not met. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">PayPal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox on the PayPal page as that adds the surcharge automatically.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/229246929\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":9000000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Implied & Nude Shoot w\/Lux Suicide - March 10th","id":"229246929","time":1457654400000,"updated":1457664885000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"131 W 86th St","name":"Jewish Center Inc","lon":-73.973335,"id":20794472,"lat":40.78698,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70521950722,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456513202000,"fee":{"amount":6,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>People Who Get Ahead In Life\u00a0<\/b><b>Are Those Who Can Communicate Effectively.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Wouldn't You Like To Develop This Priceless Skill? \u00a0<\/b><b>Now You Can!\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Come to \u00a0West Side Talkers \u00a0a<\/b><b>nd Get on The Road to Becoming<\/b> <b>The Best Speaker<\/b> <b>in Your Neck of the Woods!<\/b><\/p> <p>Develop your public speaking skills in a Fun, Warm, Friendly and Enthusiastic environment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \u201cAll great speakers were bad speakers at first\u201d.

Her practice of Yoga, Feldenkrais, Franklin, Pilates and Reiki also facilitated the deep understanding of the body.<\/p> <p>It is this passion for movement and the connection of the mind and body, which Noemi strives to pass on to her clients.<\/p> <p>Noemi noticed that all of her friends and cousins in Switzerland were doing R\u00fcckbildungsgymnastik after pregnancy with great pleasure and success. So, it seemed natural for her that all women should have access to this gentle way of regenerating their bodies.<\/p> <p>Noemi discovered that R\u00fcckbildungsgymnastik is not common practice in NYC yet and she is determined to bring it here. She enjoys sharing this type of exercise with women and witnessing their great results.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group\/events\/228948787\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"\"Revivo\" R\u00fcckbildungsgymnastik","id":"228948787","time":1457658000000,"updated":1457663316000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1325706674000,"name":"CityKinder Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3044732,"urlname":"CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"406 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"OneTaste New York Center","lon":0,"id":23779946,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452991535000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/d\/600_446086781.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us for our new open house potluck dinner night!

We will be playing one of our favorite games, Hot Seats!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hot Seats is a fun communication game where one person at a time can volunteer to have the attention the rest of the group placed on them for 1-2 minutes while they can be asked any question on any topic. You can chose to lie, tell the truth, or pass, but it's always encouraged to let your true self come out in a safe a fun environment.<\/p> <p>Whether you are someone who already OMs, you are curious and want to meet some of the OM community, or you just want to enjoy a warm and electric evening of connection, come join us!!<\/p> <p>Bring an item of food if you desire, and we will provide some extra food too! If you can't or don't have time, just bring $10 to drop in the jar.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It's a casual atmosphere and one of our favorite ways to introduce friends to the concept of OM and the community itself since there will be lots of people there with years of experience in the practice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The event is free!
