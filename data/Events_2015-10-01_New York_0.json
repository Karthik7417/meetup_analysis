She's the new digital assistant on Windows 10 and makes your computing more personal. More than that, as developers *you* can teach new tricks to Cortana and integrate her in your Windows 10 Universal apps. This is one of my most popular topics for what promises to be a super fun evening.<\/p> <p><b>OVERVIEW<\/b> <b>EVENING DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>6:00PM<\/b> - Doors open.\u00a0Food will be served, courtesy of Microsoft.

Move over Siri, Cortana is the new star in town and with her comes an army of speech-enabled mobile &amp; desktop applications on Windows 10. Mobile applications are not always easy to work with due to the small screen and small on-screen keyboard. Using our voice is a natural form of communication amongst humans, and ever since 2001\u2019s HAL9000 and Star Trek, we\u2019ve been dreaming of computers who can converse with us like Tony Stark\u2019s J.A.R.V.I.S. Or maybe you\u2019re part of the new generation of Halo geeks dreaming of Cortana? Thanks to the new Windows 10 SDK for speech recognition and speech synthesis (aka text-to-speech), we are now several steps closer to this reality.<\/p> <p>This session explores the development techniques you can use to add speech recognition to your Windows 10 applications, including in-app commands, standard &amp; custom grammars, and voice commands usable outside of your app with Cortana. We\u2019ll also see how your apps can respond to the user via speech synthesis, opening-up a new world of hands-free scenarios, and explore new features in Windows 10 like background voice commands and continuous dictation.<\/p> <p>This reality is here, you\u2019ll see actual live Windows 10 phone &amp; desktop demos with speech and you can now learn how to do it. This session covers speech scenario on Windows 10 for Phone as well as Windows 10 apps running on tablets, laptops and desktops.<\/p> <p><b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (@ActiveNick) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Vincent, NYC actor, playwright and STSANY showcase performer.<\/p> <p><i>It was a wonderful session w\/a warm, knowledgeable &amp; insightful instructor &amp; in great company!<\/i>____Allyson, Member, STSANY<\/p> <p><i>Great session; good, helpful feedback; supportive.<\/i>____Barbara, Member, STSANY<\/p> <p><i>\u201c\u00a0Fortunately for me I had the pleasure of Anna helping me with my singing technique which is something that I have always to do. I am looking forward to more meetups and meeting new people. You should all attend this meetup whether you are experienced or a beginner (like me).\u00a0You will be able to discover something so unique and wonderful about yourself with this group. I can guarantee it!\u00a0\u201d_<\/i>_____Chels, Members, STSANY<\/p> <p><i>An excellent meetup! Anna knows her stuff and helped me improve my performances; the other members\/performers are talented and friendly and fun.\"<\/i>____Glen, Member, STSANY<\/p> <p><i>The MUSICALE\u00a0was a wonderfully\u00a0diverse program in an intimate setting. I found the preliminary workshops\u00a0extremely helpful\u00a0in putting a role I'd worked on\u00a0(for longer than I'd like to say) into a historical, musical, and linguistic framework. I am eager to do more!\u00a0Anna Bartos is knowledgeable about a broad range of musical styles and genres, acting and character development as well as singing.\u00a0I would definitely like to perform in this type of event again. For me, once a season would be good (3-4 times a year).\"<\/i>____Rebecca, Member of STSANY (Musicale on 1\/19\/14)<\/p> <p><i>Amazing event.\u00a0Thank you, Anna for holding the musicale.\u00a0I am also glad to meet new singers.<\/i>___Saadat, Member of STSANY<\/p> <p><i>What a delightful surprise! One often doesn't know what to expect of a showcase! Congratulations to Anna, a real pro, and an impressive mentor to a diverse array of talent.\u00a0The 'meet-up' seems to be a real resource for both\u00a0the performers and\u00a0those of us in the audience.\u00a0 Keep up the good work!____<\/i><i>Mary Jay,\u00a0Seasoned Senior\u00a0Performer<\/i><\/p> <p><i>It was a privilege to work with Anna Bartos\u00a0on this\u00a09\/11 memorial concert. All of the performers were of high caliber and the audience rewarded our efforts with heartfelt applause.

It doesn't matter if you use Python, R, or Excel, have 2 years of experience or 2 days, everyone is welcome to join. But to make it worth your time, check out the tutorial list FIRST. Pair up in a group if you see something interesting. Otherwise, add a tutorial so that others can join you.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/224912128\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytmbcb","time":1441146600000,"updated":1441158663000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424150422000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out and play some games, hang out, have fun and may be make some new friends.<\/p> <p>\n\nLeave a comment if you are bringing any games.

The ideas expressed here will remove from your consciousness any fear of so-called death.<\/p> <p>Reincarnation is one of the world's most disputed doctrine. The belief in reincarnation has had millions of intelligent, learned, and tolerant followers throughout the ages. Ringing through the minds and hearts of students, mystics, and thinkers have always been the words: \"Why Are We Here?\" Reincarnation has been criticized by some as conflicting with sacred literature and as being without verification. This book reveals, however, in an intelligent manner the many facts to support reincarnation.<\/p> <p>Quotations from eminent authorities, and from Biblical\u00a0and Sacred works substantiate reincarnation. It places it high above mere speculation. This book is without exaggeration the most complete, inspiring, enlightening book ever written on this subject. It is not a fiction story but a step-by-step revelation of profound mystical laws. Look at some of these thought-provoking, intriguing subjects: The Cosmic Conception; The Personality of the Soul; Does Personality Survive Transition?; Heredity and Inheritance; Karma and Personal Evolution; Religious and Biblical Viewpoints; Christian References; Between Incarnations; Souls of Animals and the \"Unborn\"; Recollections of the Past.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224384126\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry- Mansions of the Soul: Cosmic Conception of the Soul","id":"fpbtflytmbcb","time":1441146600000,"updated":1441158451000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10034","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"330 West 40th street, (between 8th and 9th avenue)","name":"Skyroom Rooftop","lon":-73.918007,"id":2683201,"state":"NY","lat":40.862411,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.64890575409,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440528531000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join NYC's hottest fashionistas at MEETUP's #1 FASHION MIXER! \u00a0200+ attend every time we do it!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/d\/5\/600_436888629.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>This is a FREE multi-group event with a great fashion show,\u00a0drink &amp; food specials, DJ, and breath taking views of the Manhattan Skyline at NYC's highest luxury penthouse\/rooftop!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Drink &amp; Food Specials\u00a0until 7pm<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0DJ spins from 7pm-11pm!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0LIVE FASHION SHOW starts @ 9:30pm!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Meet the models and designer after the show\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Professional Photography (Cameras allowed)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 NO COVER. \u00a0Just RSVP w\/ group &amp; say MEETUP at door\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Come check out the hottest fashion trends of the season!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/d\/1\/600_440319889.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Fellow Meetup organizer Lyndon will be your host on 34th Fl (where DJ is located).\u00a0 Optional name tags will be available.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dress: Business Casual.

By reversing the roles of fitting into heteronormative society, the show is a parody of the stereotypes that plague the LGBT community and boasts a strong message, we are more successful when we are ourselves. Towleroad just picked up the series as an exclusive and this will be the first public screening of the show. The premiere program will include gay stand up comics, a fashion show and the pilot episode of the series followed by a Q&amp;A with the actors and director after the screening and an after party.<\/p> <p>We will have the entire top floor to ourselves for the event and our own private servers providing food and drink. This will be a great time to mingle and socialize with your fellow gays, film enthusiasts, artist and entertainment lovers.<\/p> <p>The RSVP link is below.

We've got another free pre-release screaming for you!<\/p> <p><br\/>The virus is spreading, and FANGORIA has the cure -- free tickets to see the scary and gruesome sequel CONTRACTED: PHASE II in the Big Apple! Directed by Josh Forbes from a script by Craig Walendziak, the follow-up film begins at the exact moment where the original CONTRACTED ended (which fans can catch up with on Netflix Instant). The screening marks PHASE II's New York premiere, and FANGO's Tony Timpone will be hosting the event.<\/p> <p>For those unfamiliar, here's the official synopsis and teaser trailer\u2026<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/5\/3\/600_441508243.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>\" After CONTRACTED unleashed the world\u2019s most horrifying virus, this sequel picks up the story as newly infected Riley (returning actor Matt Mercer) races against time to contain the outbreak, even as it ravages his own body. As he digs deeper into its origins, Riley attracts the attention of a detective (Marianna Palka) who doubts his innocence, and BJ (Morgan Peter Brown of ABSENTIA) himself, who holds the key to the virus -- and perhaps the destruction of mankind as we know it, leading to a blood-soaked finale you have to see to believe. Hang on to your barf bags, buckle up and get ready for the genre ride of the year! \"<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>The FANGO screening of CONTRACTED: PHASE II is a <i>free<\/i> show; to obtain tickets, send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

These sensory distortions range from the shimmering zigzags of a visual migraine to powerful visions brought on by fever, injuries, drugs, sensory deprivation, exhaustion, or even grief. Hallucinations doubtless lie behind many mythological traditions, literary inventions, and religious epiphanies. Drawing on his own experiences, a wealth of clinical cases from among his patients, and famous historical examples ranging from Dostoevsky to Lewis Carroll, the legendary neurologist Oliver Sacks investigates the mystery of these sensory deceptions: what they say about the working of our brains, how they have influenced our folklore and culture, and why the potential for hallucination is present in us all.<\/p> <p><br\/>This event is hosted by Bob Braine. for information on this month's book, email [masked].

INSANITY pushes the participants to new training heights, resulting in more calories burned, faster results and more efficient metabolism. This interval training is the pinnacle of cardio training. You don't have to be in extreme shape - levels of each exercise are provided.<br\/>Insanity's not your traditional interval workout. It replaces traditional moderate-intensity exercise with maximum-intensity exercise, and trades short intervals of intensity for short periods of rest. The secret? Long periods of explosive intensity. You\u2019ll do cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training. With Insanity, you can burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour. Participants experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Class Description:<br\/>PLYOMETRICS for insane legs and gluts, UPPER BODY RESISTANCE for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest, and back.

This also fill the waiting time nicely for others who for some reason are running behind. Suggested time is around 15-30 minutes, with 2 minutes for serves practice.<br\/>*\u00a0<b>Teaming\/Pairing<\/b>: Players can pick their partners for the day. Ladies get a chance to make their choices first. Attempt is made to have balanced teams to have a good engaging tennis game.<br\/>*\u00a0<b>Game<br\/><\/b>- We play 1 set and follow the standard rules of tennis.<br\/>- For first set \"First-Ball-In (FBI)\" so this ensures that at least you get your first serve in as\u00a0courtesy by taking maximum\u00a010 chances. It is only for the first set of the day. Subsequent sets start without any practice serves or first-ball-in.\u00a0<br\/>- Sides are rotated on every odd number of games such as 1, 3, 5 etc.<br\/>- In case of 6-6, the set is settled through tie-break.<br\/>- The scores are to be spoken out loud by the server after every point, so that there is no confusion or conflict during or at the end of the game.<br\/>- If the court has counter to keep the set-score, it must be updated so that other players get to know the score to coordinate the switching smoothly.<br\/>*\u00a0<b>After Set<\/b>:<br\/>- The winner pair stays together and they move \"up\" to play against the winners of next court. Move \"up\" means towards the higher ratings and move \"down\" means towards lower ratings.<br\/>- The\u00a0loosing pair moves \"down\" and splits to form new team, hoping to find the winning combination.<br\/>- Ultimately there is one pair who stands out as the \"Champs of the day\" if no more challenger pair left. That is \u00a0the official ending of the tennis day, though players can stay longer to play more among themselves.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0<b>Social<\/b>: Depending on the mood and liking of the group, we can go out to eat, drink, and chit-chat somewhere\u00a0close-by\u00a0after the game.<\/p> <p><b>Miscellaneous other stuff<\/b>:\u00a0<br\/>- Please bring a can of new \/ practice balls to play on hard courts.<br\/>- Players get\u00a0tips by other players if they are open to improve their games.

It\u2019s a really neat use of game design combining an intriguing theme and great visual setup. It\u2019s target audience might be a bit younger than our usual attendees however it looked too cool not to invite them out!

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Mamoun's of course has the Middle Eastern standards: hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, plus lentil soup (so delicious!), grape leaves (my favorite grape leaves), spinach pie -- all perfectly made and all so inexpensive!

In this talk, Francesco will walk through the topology patterns of modern distributed Erlang architectures, discussing the tradeoffs in scalability and reliability the actor model, the failure model and the built-in distribution model encourage you to take.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Francesco is the founder of Erlang Solutions Ltd (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.erlang-solutions.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.erlang-solutions.com\/<\/a>). He has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson\u2019s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson\u2019s Erlang training and consulting arm, working on the first release of the OTP middleware, which he applied to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, allowing him to work in major Erlang-based projects both within and outside Ericsson.

Then <b><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i><\/b> may be just for you! Channeled by the same voice that authored ACIM but in more easy to understand language, Mari Perron's <i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> speaks to the heart rather than the mind. Let's explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week, taking breaks whenever Yasuko is away teaching in Japan (usually November, March and July).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/c\/f\/600_440872687.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth.<\/p> <p>Classes are $20 and class cards are available.<\/p> <p>Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/crsny.org\/yasuko\/about\">Yasuko Kasaki<\/a>\u00a0has been teaching\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>\u00a0and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999.

The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Apache Drill started off with the audacious goal of delivering consistent, millisecond ANSI SQL query capability across wide range of data formats. At a high level, this translates to two key requirements \u2013 Schema Flexibility and Performance.<\/p> <p><br\/>Apache Drill provides the users the ability to interact with big data on Hadoop much faster and far more easily using the familiar SQL language. Users are no longer dependent on central IT teams and DBAs to produce schemas and then maintain them when the structure changes for a few records. Drill alleviates the pain associated with structuring unstructured data before one gains any insights by providing a simple mechanism to query any dataset on Hadoop - be it flat files, parquet or JSON files or tables within an HBase table. This session will give you an overview of several different use cases that enterprises are testing Drill for as well as the latest news on the project.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/c\/a\/600_440260394.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>BIO ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Vince Gonzalez - Systems Engineer, MapR<\/b>Vince Gonzalez is a Systems Engineer for MapR. \u00a0He has 20 years of experience designing, implementing and automating infrastructure and applications.

After graduating from Middlebury College with a B.A. in American literature in 1968, Bob journeyed to the East where he became a member of the Longchen Nyingthig Ngagyur Nyingmpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. In 1975, as part of his practice of Bodhisattvic compassion, Bob began studying Tibetan Buddhist medicine. However, because of the difficulties of studying Tibetan medicine as a Westerner at that time, he became interested in Chinese medicine, a close cousin of Tibetan medicine which, due to Nixon's \"opening of China,\" was becoming popular in the U.S. At roughly the same time, Bob began studying and practicing a number of Chinese systems of yoga and martial arts, including Tai Ji, Ba Gua, Xing Yi, Wing Chun, and Tibetan White Crane.<\/p> <p>After studying Chinese medical theory, especially five phase theory, and shiatsu at the Boulder School of Massage Therapy, Bob began formally studying acupuncture and Chinese medicine with Dr. (Eric) Tao Xi-yu of Denver in 1977. In 1979, Bob opened a private practice in acupuncture in Boulder, CO. From[masked], Bob continued his studies of acupuncture, tuina (Chinese medical massage), and Chinese herbal medicine at the Shanghai College of Chinese Medicine. Since then, Bob has been actively engaged not only in private practice but also in translating, writing, teaching, and research.

Have you ever wondered \"What do the cards mean?\" Or, \"Why does every book you've looked at say the cards mean something else?\" This class will answer both those questions and more.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The on-going classes, will feature Tarot Symbolism, the Esoteric Titles assigned to each card in the Tarot as well as what each title means, Astrology and the Tarot, Qabalah and the Tarot, which includes a study of the Tree of Life, \u00a0Alchemy and the Tarot, as well as Tarot Tips and some History of the Tarot. While you don't need to know tarot's history to read the Tarot, you won't be fooled by anyone who claims that tarot is ancient, because it isn't. \u00a0<\/p> <p>All levels are welcome, even if this is your very first class.<\/p> <p>There will be a Meet-Up sign on the table.<\/p> <p>Please try to arrive by 7:00 PM or before.

Everyone, who wants to can participate and is encouraged to do so. It's fun to share our knowledge with one another.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0I will arrive by 6:00 PM to get us a table. \u00a0The 2 hours will also be enough time to answer any questions you may have and if we go a little over that's fine, too. \u00a0I would like us to continue doing some simple, practice spreads, because being able to practice coupled with the additional knowledge you will get, will increase your intuition and your reading skills. This is what will help to make you into a stronger reader.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please remember to bring a sweater or a light jacket. Panera Bread uses air-conditioning and it can get cold. Even a fun class won't be any fun if you're uncomfortable.<\/p> <p>Please bring a pen and paper to take notes and the Universal Waite deck, if possible. Other Rider Waite decks are okay but have different coloring, etc. The differences in the deck will change the interpretation so it's best if we are all looking at the same cards.<\/p> <p>This class will be on the Hermit from the Major Arcana.<\/p> <p>Payment can be made in class.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I look forward to seeing you all then.

He lives alone, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. But when a mysterious package appears at the bookstore, its unexpected arrival gives Fikry the chance to make his life over--and see everything anew.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bayside-Books\/events\/221575054\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":7200000,"name":"September 2015 - THE STORIED LIFE OF A.J.

The peace and tranquility he hopes to find, though, is anything but, once he agrees to being accompanied by the onlyperson he can find willing to join him on the trek - his long lost and former friend Katz (Academy Award nominee Nick Nolte), a down-on-his-luck serial philanderer who, after a lifetime of relying on his charm and wits to keep one step ahead of the law - sees the trip as a way to sneak out of paying some debts and sneak into one last adventure before its too late. The trouble is, the two have a completely different definition of the word, \"adventure\". Now they're about to find out that when you push yourself to the edge, the real fun begins.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/222972081\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Happiness and the Passing of Time 7:30-9pm at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"mhqchlytmbfb","time":1441323000000,"updated":1442558464000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11237","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"271 Starr St","name":"Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos","lon":-73.92197,"id":23207822,"state":"NY","lat":40.706608,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":4.66527748108,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437579690000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/m.yelp.com\/biz\/tortilleria-mexicana-los-hermanos-brooklyn-2\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/m.yelp.com\/biz\/tortilleria-mexicana-los-hermanos-brooklyn-2<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Taco-Thursdays\/events\/224095818\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos (271 Starr Street)","id":"224095818","time":1441323000000,"updated":1441408034000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1437261607000,"name":"Taco Thursdays","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18750919,"urlname":"Taco-Thursdays","group_lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Taquitos"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07652","country":"us","city":"Paramus","address_1":"200 N Rt 17","name":"B.P.O.

Don Watson, National Vice-Chairman and North Carolina State Chairman will lead the discussion on what can be done to address the concerns we all share for the status of our country\u2019s civil government.

So sign on with us for the conference call to discuss issues and contribute your thoughts about what we can be doing politically. Our conference calls are open to the public and are for all of us who are interested in the Christian Party of America. It is an easy-access way to share ideas and learn more about what is going on around the country with the Christian Party of America. Hope you can make it!<\/p> <p>The conference call will last for about an hour and a half, but staying for the entire call is optional. If you get a message that the circuits are busy, just keep trying the number and it eventually works. There is no extra charge to participate other than the usual charges by your phone plan for a long distance call.
