Their delicious Limeade beverage comes in three yummy flavors: Lime, Lavender and Passion Fruit. Charmaine DaCosta, the founder of Limation\u2122, was born in Jamaica. She grew up drinking \u201clemonade\u201d made with limes and brown sugar. In the fertile \u201cgully\u201d where her grandmother grew various produce, limes, oranges and grapefruit were abundant but lemons were few. The sweet, tart drink, as she remembers it, was delicious, refreshing and altogether satisfying. Imagine her surprise then when she first asked for lemonade in the United States. What she received in no way resembled what she had come to recognize as lemonade, neither in color, taste nor bouquet were they the same. Although she later developed a taste for lemons, she really missed the homegrown version of her favorite drink, so she started making it whenever she would find limes at the market. She started making lemonade for her friends whenever she had a gathering at her house and they all loved it but did not identify it as lemonade. The misnomer corrected to limeade, Charmaine realized that there was a space in the market for a really good limeade drink after having unsuccessfully tried to find one for years. Thus, Limation was born. The ingredients consist of- Freshly squeezed lime juice, organic cane sugar, filtered water and other natural ingredients, minus the preservatives and other naughty additives.

Their delicious Limeade beverage comes in three yummy flavors: Lime, Lavender and Passion Fruit. Charmaine DaCosta, the founder of Limation\u2122, was born in Jamaica. She grew up drinking \u201clemonade\u201d made with limes and brown sugar. In the fertile \u201cgully\u201d where her grandmother grew various produce, limes, oranges and grapefruit were abundant but lemons were few. The sweet, tart drink, as she remembers it, was delicious, refreshing and altogether satisfying. Imagine her surprise then when she first asked for lemonade in the United States. What she received in no way resembled what she had come to recognize as lemonade, neither in color, taste nor bouquet were they the same. Although she later developed a taste for lemons, she really missed the homegrown version of her favorite drink, so she started making it whenever she would find limes at the market. She started making lemonade for her friends whenever she had a gathering at her house and they all loved it but did not identify it as lemonade. The misnomer corrected to limeade, Charmaine realized that there was a space in the market for a really good limeade drink after having unsuccessfully tried to find one for years. Thus, Limation was born. The ingredients consist of- Freshly squeezed lime juice, organic cane sugar, filtered water and other natural ingredients, minus the preservatives and other naughty additives.

Unfortunately we had a couple selfish people that felt it was more important to argue for calls to go their way as opposed to redoing the downs and following the dispute resolution protocols.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you're not familiar with it, whenever there is a dispute the call will be decided by any outside parties i.e. people on the sidelines. If there aren't any then the respective QBs will make a decision. If it's too close to call then it's a redo. There are no lines, only approximations with the cones and everyone will have a different angle and opinion. Let's not argue and just redo a down.<\/p> <p>So here were a few things I noticed:<\/p> <p>\"The Pass Interference Call\" - going forward only the receiver can make a PI call. Your teammates can't call it for you. Hopefully this shuts down some ppl from speaking just because they like the sound of their own voice.<\/p> <p>\"The Keyshawn Rule\" - do not scream at the QB to throw you the ball! You might think you're the best player in the game (you're not) and you have best mismatch (you don't). You are NOT the QB and you're only as good as the trust the QB has in you. If you're screaming for the \"damn\" ball you are acting selfishly and disrespectfully - thinking you're better than everyone on your team. If I'm QB'ing you're guaranteed to NOT get the ball. There are better ways to communicate with the QB if you think he's not noticing the defense's lapses. Next time someone does that then they'll be placed on notice for this unsportsman-like conduct.<\/p> <p>\"Too Many Cooks In The Kitchen\" - if you want to QB then let me know in the beginning. A primary and backup or co-QB will be assigned for each game. If there are an abundance then ppl that hadn't QB'ed in the first game will be afforded the opportunity the subsequent game. Of course if you suck then you can be supplanted or benched.<\/p> <p>\"The Hard Tag In An Effort to Dislodge The Ball\" - this is two hand touch football. The rule has been instituted that as soon as you tag someone it's a dead ball unless the ball was moving during the tag. I've placed one person on notice for their hard tags last week and I will reinforce it this week.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"The Disparager\" - Since Abe was so public in questioning the \"integrity\" of the meetup and how he's \"going to find a separate meetup\" then I no qualms about airing this as well.\u00a0I care deeply the integrity of this meetup and what we have all built up for a decade now. Of course we're not perfect and I'm all ears to improving in private conversations, however I have no patience for public remarks that disparage our meetup. Frankly I think this tantrum is immature and self deprecating. Maybe you look to Cam Newton as a role model. Normally I would have granted you your wish and booted you out but I'd like to give everyone the benefit of doubt. I think you're better served by learning patience and modesty from other fellow members. Don't misconstrue kindness with weakness; you have been WARNED. If this occurs again then go ahead and find your \"better meetup.\"<\/p> <p>At the end of the day this meetup about everyone getting together to play a game we love and the camaraderie from good people. If you think it's more important to win an argument about one or two plays and ruin the \"fun\" of the game then you need to take a step back and see the big picture. Otherwise people will be fed up and just walk away from you and\/or the game.<\/p> <p>This week will be cold. If you're man enough for the cold then come join us. If you're going to be full of estrogen and moody then stay home.<\/p> <p>***************<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Attendance will be strictly enforced. No-shows will be marked and posted on the subsequent meetup. First time offenders will be given the benefit of doubt, second time offenders will be warned (consider your name in this email and the number of times you no-showed as warning) and those who miss a third time will be banned,permanently!\u00a0Those that show up without RSVP to circumvent this will be warned as well.

However, this popular model does not truly get to the heart of the evolution-religion issue. Today we have a well-developed scientific account of religion that sees belief in God arising naturally from mental tools that evolved to serve the survival needs of our earliest ancestors. This poses a much greater challenge for religion than simply having to re-interpret Genesis. This challenge, however, does not negate religion, nor undermine its significance. Evolutionary accounts of religion uncover a common human experience beneath the diversity of religious traditions. Despite the deep conflicts between religions, each gives expression to a deeper, and commonly shared moral impulse. From this view, religion is an attempt to bring out this common thread of our humanity. This humanistic conception of religion fits comfortably within a Darwinian worldview.<\/p> <p>John Teehan holds a Doctorate in Philosophy (Graduate Center, CUNY, 1992). \u00a0His main research focus is on the cognitive\/evolutionary study of morality and religion, with a special interest in religious morality and religion\u2019s role in conflict.

This was, the scientists concluded, a large, dark chamber for the dead of a previously unidentified species of the early human lineage \u2014 Homo naledi. The species name, H. naledi, refers to the cave where the bones lay undisturbed for so long; \u201cnaledi\u201d means \u201cstar\u201d in the local Sesotho language.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>In what is being hailed as one of the most significant discoveries of the past 50 years, a team of research specialists including two NYU anthropologists has discovered a new species of human ancestors known as Homo naledi in Johannesburg, South Africa.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The team, led by University of Witwatersrand professor Lee Berger, has been conducting expeditions to expand the knowledge gained from new fossils that contribute to the understanding of human origins.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The exploration took place in the Rising Star Cave located at the Cradle of Humankind world heritage site, where explorers found incredible amounts of fossils in a chamber, accessible only through a narrow chute 100 yards from the cave\u2019s entrance.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The 1,500 bones, recovered in late 2013, were incredibly well-preserved and showed no sign of a catastrophic event, suggesting that the previously isolated cave had been used as a burial ground for the dead. This theory is particularly notable because it indicates that Homo naledi may have thought about mortality, a behavior that had been uniquely associated with humans.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Fossils excavated from the site included the complete skeletal structures of infants, children, adults and geriatrics.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

For those who prefer non-meat, they have a wonderful seafood selection. Each couple is responsible for the cost of their own meal.

There is no need to find a friend to come with, although you are welcomed to bring a plus on or three. In the past five years of owning this group, I have had numerous conversations with many of you about being single and living in New York. I have volunteered, had dinner and gone on walks with almost all of you, and the truth is, I cannot understand why such great people are still single.<\/p> <p><br\/>If at any time, you do not see someone you have a crush on in the group (or merely interested in) message and I will see if they are free for that evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>There are too many singles in New York to not participate. We will have custom made name tags with like minded labels i.e Outdoorsy, Art-lover, Independent Film Fan, Culture Enthusiast and Music Lover.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>This the one occasion that what you're interested will be the dominant.

It was like 18 beautiful women and 2 guys (hint, hint).

Speed dating may be an option. Here's how it works: Interested men and women gather at a predetermined spot. While the women sit at individual tables, the men rotate in 6 minute intervals until they have met and talked to every woman in the room. At the end of the evening, you let the event organizer know which people you are interested in seeing again.\u00a0 You receive an email within 48 hours with your matches.\u00a0 What you decide to do next is up to you!<\/p> <p><b>Speed Date Prep<\/b><\/p> <p>Everybody prepares for dates in different ways, but it is good to have at least some idea of your dating preferences prior to an event. Develop an idea of your likes and dislikes. It may help to make a list -- write down any potential \"deal breakers\" -- traits or habits that you would never want to find in a person you date. Come up with questions on matters that are important to you.\u00a0 Make a list of things you like to do in your free time or things that you would like to try or experience. Remember, it never hurts to be a little adventurous and you are looking for a person to possibly share in these adventures.<\/p> <p><b>If I Meet Someone I Really Like, What Happens Next?<\/b><\/p> <p>You've completed your first speed dating experience; what happens next? You should get your results within 48 hours. Then you'll be staring at email addresses and trying to figure out your next step. Suggest meeting for a drink or a casual event that will take some of the pressure off of you both. If you both went to the speed dating event with friends, suggest a non-speed dating reunion at a local bar where you can hang out and laugh over your shared experience.<\/p> <p>So now that you understand Speed Dating and are prepared, have you registered? \u00a0<\/p> <p>Events are posted in multiple MeetUp Groups, websites, FaceBook pages, and more.

His personal aesthetic has translated seamlessly to brands like Red Bull and Reebok, and has garnered the attention of editorial clients like The Associated Press, Rolling Stone Magazine, VICE and The New York Times. Drew has spent the last ten years traveling the world with his camera, is accustomed to working with productions of all sizes, working quickly under pressure, and staying within budget to deliver memorable and emotionally charged imagery of celebrities in and out of the spotlight. He got his start in the industry traveling the world with world-renowned photographer, Joe McNally for five years, as his first assistant and right-hand man. Logging close to half a million miles in the air, he assisted Joe with client shoots, workshops and conferences around the world, working with tens of thousands of people. DrewGurian.com<\/p> <p>Keziban Barry, born in Andover, MA has traversed the globe living in diverse cities across seven different countries. After an early career as a photo editor at National Geographic Adventure Magazine, Keziban dedicated the next part of her career to combining her past documentary experience with her love of art. She developed a photographic mission to capture the cinematic \"just before\" and \"just after\" of a momentous action: where subjects and spectators experience the anxiety that awaits an imminent fate or confront the tragic result of a seemingly inescapable reality. Her subjects blend courage with vulnerability, reflecting a life lived across racial, economic and geographic boundaries.Keziban has since been published in Aesthetica, Architectural Digest, Art+Auction, Modern Painters, O Magazine, Musee, among the many. She exhibited in a group show at the International Center of Photography curated by Amy Arbus in 2010 and hosted her first solo exhibition at Norwood, New York City in November, 2013. Keziban currently resides in New York City where she continues to photograph and make short films. KezibanBarry.com<\/p> <p>Thomas Shim is an award winning Global Creative Director based in New York City. He is a Creative Director by title but takes all the best qualities of an art director, a filmmaker, and a photographer and roll them into one big ball. He has created 360-integrated campaign for major brands such as Dell, Dos Equis, Heinken, and Durex. Once everything gets put away, you'll find out that his favorite movie is the Carol Reed &amp; Orson Welles classic \"The Third Man,\" that he's a loyal friend, likes kids, rainbows, plushies, long walks on the beach, a little Mozart with a Barolo,and reading Charles Bukowski in front of a roaring fire.<\/p> <p>Andrea Wise is curently a photo editor for ViewFind.com, a photojournalism startup aimed at bringing visual stories to a mass audience while helping photojournalists monetize their archives and get commissions. She earned her M.S. in Photography from Syracuse University where she was an Instructional Associate teaching photography and multimedia production to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as Graduate Assistant to Mike Davis, Chair of the Alexia Foundation for World Peace.

But one of those Keys has just resurfaced and numerous factions are dead-set on possessing it. This means certain doom for the poor souls who've stumbled upon it.<\/p> <p>Are these unfortunate souls mere pawns in a greater game? Do they even know of that which fate has cast their way?<\/p> <p>If they are truly unaware of the significance of that which they now possess, it would be to their benefit to become aware of it. Fate and destiny have converged upon them and, before long, many will vie to possess the item they hold. Many will seek to become the Keeper of the Keys and our intrepid adventurers stand in their way.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nBACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I am looking to run this campaign as part of the Edison MeetUp group. However, I cannot run\/attend a weekly game. My schedule simply does not allow for it.<\/p> <p>So I'm setting this group up as a bi-weekly game; sort-of. Specifically, I will schedule a recurring MeetUp for the first and third Monday of each month beginning with February 15th, 2016. I will also schedule a bonus MeetUp for the fifth Monday of those months that have five Mondays.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.\u00a0<br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses\u00a0<br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.\u00a0<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you\u00a0<br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind\u00a0<br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.\u00a0<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others.

This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself.

There's an eat in area on the mezzanine floor. Please purchase fruit or salad (at least part of your meal) from Whole Foods so we will be welcome there in the future. Since raw fruit and salad is the basis of the 80\/10\/10 diet, let's support each other by having food together that falls within 80\/10\/10 guidelines. 80\/10\/10 beverages include water, coconut water and some occasionally have juices.<\/p> <p>This Whole Foods has a weird layout. Most of the produce is on level 2 which you can get to by escalator. There are only two check out lines at street level (level 1) yet many cashiers so the sometimes long lines usually move quickly. Once done with your purchase you can get to the eat in area on the mezzanine level by walking up the stairs near the 87th street exit. The store doesn't allow you to enter on 87th street.<\/p> <p>If you want to check in with us first, it's not as obvious how to get to the mezzanine level. You can enter on 88th street and take the elevator to the mezzanine level once in the store. The escalators don't even go to this in between mezzanine level, only to levels 1 and 2. There is also a small opening to pass near the check out lines but that can be hard to find.<\/p> <p>Please avoid wearing fragrances as several people in our group are sensitive to them including myself.<\/p> <p>I will post my cell phone number in the comments the day before the event so you can contact me if you have trouble finding us or want to know if we are still there. :)<\/p> <p>Please note this is different than a common past location on the east side.\u00a0 It is NOT the East 57th street one, it's at 88th Street and 3rd Avenue.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If taking subway, the closest one is 86th and Lexington and the 4,5 and 6 stop there.

Koonin | Director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>TITLE:<\/b><br\/><i>Adventures in Urban Informatics<\/i><\/p> <p><b>ABSTRACT:<\/b><br\/>For the first time in history, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas; in just a few more decades, the world's population will exceed 9 billion, 70 percent of whom will live in cities. Enabling those cities to deliver services effectively, efficiently, and sustainably while keeping their citizens safe, healthy, prosperous, and well-informed will be among the most important undertakings in this century. I will review how we are establishing a center for urban science and focus on bringing informatics to the study and operation of urban systems. I will touch on the rational, the structure, and the substance of the Center's work and the ways in which it will enrich NYC and contribute to global issues. Taxis, lights, sewers, phones, and buildings will all enter into the discussion in novel ways.<\/p> <p><b>BIOGRAPHY:<\/b><br\/>Steven E. Koonin was appointed as the founding Director of NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress in April 2012. That consortium of academic, corporate, and government partners will pursue research and education activities to develop and demonstrate informatics technologies for urban problems in the \"living laboratory\" of New York City.<\/p> <p>He previously served as the U.S. Department of Energy's second Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Science from May 19, 2009 through November 18, 2011. As Under Secretary for Science, Dr. Koonin functioned as the Department's chief scientific officer, coordinating and overseeing research across the DOE. He led the preparation of the Department's 2011 Strategic Plan and was the principal author of its Quadrennial Technology Review. Dr. Koonin particularly championed research programs in High Performance Simulation, Exascale Computing, Inertial Fusion Energy, and Greenhouse Gas Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification. He also provided technical counsel on diverse nuclear security matters.<\/p> <p>He joined the California Institute of Technology's faculty in 1975, was a research fellow at the Niels Bohr Institute during[masked], and was an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow during 1977-1979. He became a professor of theoretical physics at Caltech in 1981 and served as Chairman of the Faculty from 1989-1991. Dr. Koonin was the seventh provost of Caltech from 1995-2004. In that capacity, he was involved in identifying and recruiting 1\/3 of the Institute's professorial faculty and left an enduring legacy of academic and research initiatives in the biological, physical, earth, and social sciences, as well as the planning and development of the Thirty-Meter Telescope project.<\/p> <p>As the Chief Scientist at BP from 2004 to early 2009, Dr. Koonin developed the long-range technology strategy for alternative and renewable energy sources. He managed the firm's university-based research programs and played a central role in establishing the Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<\/p> <p>Dr. Koonin is a member and past chair of the JASON Study Group, advising the U.S. Government on technical matters of national security. He has served on numerous advisory committees for the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense, including the Defense Science Board and the CNO's Executive Panel. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Trilateral Commission and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences . In 1985, Dr. Koonin received the Humboldt Senior U.S. Scientist Award and, in 1998 the Department of Energy's E.O. Lawrence Award for his broad impact on nuclear many-body physics, on astrophysics, and on a variety of related fields where sophisticated numerical methods are essential; and in particular, for his breakthrough in nuclear shell model calculations centered on an ingenious method for dealing with the huge matrices of heavy nuclei by using path integral methods combined with the Monte Carlo technique.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/9\/0\/600_446783440.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Data-Science-Institute\/events\/228812925\/","yes_rsvp_count":53,"name":"Colloquium Event | Steven Koonin | Adventures in Urban Informatics","id":"228812925","time":1455661800000,"updated":1455673600000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1426608148000,"name":"Columbia Data Science Institute","group_lon":-74,"id":18508242,"urlname":"Columbia-Data-Science-Institute","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"DSI Followers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10128","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1071 5th Avenue (at 89th Street)","name":"Guggenheim Museum","lon":-73.95887,"id":9564272,"state":"NY","lat":40.782978,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.80645537376,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454688384000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Art+Feminism is a rhizomatic campaign to improve coverage of women and the arts on Wikipedia, and to encourage female editorship.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Meetup\/ArtAndFeminism\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Meetup\/ArtAndFeminism<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Wikipedia's gender trouble is well documented.

Our analysis is based on over 360,000 articles on 50 large financial companies, mostly banks and insurers, published in 1996--2014. We find that the interaction between measures of unusualness and sentiment forecasts volatility at both the company-specific and aggregate level. These effects persist for several months. The pattern of response of volatility in our aggregate analysis is consistent with a model of rational inattention among investors<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Harry Mamaysky<\/b> is the head of research and a founding partner at Osprey Bay Capital Management LLC.\u00a0 He is a visiting research scholar and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.

That land, where the life of the common man is cheap and reckless kings all-too-often burn their lives, and kingdoms, out in blazes of glory.<\/p> <p>The Korina Archipelago is home to several large city-states, each of which views the others as rivals, but generally coexist, for there are greater threats to their safety. Renegade Altameran privateers,\u00a0depraved nation-less pirates, demon-worshiping cannibals, horrors from the uncharted oceans, and far worse are reminders for the city-states of the constant dangers that exist outside their walls.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These dangers are all-too-real, and to whom can one turn to in times of desperation and need when threats arise? Each city-state will defend its own, but outside that, help is not easy to come by.

You want to join this dataset with shapes (be it neighborhoods in New York boroughs, the road system in NYC, the canal systems in Amsterdam, what have you). How do you do this join at scale? Our goal in this talk is to show how we are solving this problem using Magellan and Spark. Magellan is a newly open sourced geospatial analytics engine written on top of Spark and is the first such engine to deeply leverage Spark SQL, Dataframes and Catalyst for spacial analytics.\u00a0 This talk will focus on one specific aspect of Magellan: how does Magellan implement Spatial Joins, and where does it leverage Spark SQL for efficiency and simplicity? The talk should be of interest to developers who wish to understand how to leverage Spark SQL in richer ways than before, those interested in writing specialized analytics engines on top of Spark SQL, and Data Scientists and Data Engineers who wish to perform spatial analytics processing or predictive analytics on geospatial datasets at scale.<\/p> <p><b>Chris Fregly<\/b> from IBM will present <b>Real-time, Advanced Analytics and Recommendations using Machine Learning, Graph Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Approximations<br\/><\/b> <i>BONUS: \u00a0Netflix Recommendations: \u00a0Then and Now<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Agenda<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Mingling from 6:30-7 and again from 8-9<br\/><\/i>Talks begin@7<\/p> <p><br\/>Bios<br\/><b>Reynold Xin,<\/b> Spark PMC member and Chief Architect for Spark at Databricks, will give an introduction, followed by 3 talks.<\/p> <p><b>Nong Li\u00a0 <\/b>is a software engineer working at Databricks on Spark core and Spark SQL with a focus on performance-related work.

<p>Apache Mesos provides a platform for building distributed systems. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with API\u2019s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments. How to use that platform and what to make of it becomes a complex task requiring not only understanding of where the system has been but also where it is going. Using schedulers like Marathon and Aurora help to get your applications scheduled and executing on Mesos. In many cases it makes sense to build a framework and integrate directly. This talk will breakdown what is involved in building a framework in Go, how to-do this with examples and why you would want to-do this. Frameworks are not only for generally available software applications (like Kafka, HDFS, Spark ,etc) but should \u00a0also be used for custom internal R&amp;D built software applications too.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Speaker:<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Joe Stein is a frequent speaker on Apache Kafka, Mesos, Hadoop and Cassandra.

In this talk, Rory Sawyer, Software Engineer at MediaMath, will describe how this effort transformed MediaMath\u2019s legacy architecture and legacy mindset, which imposed harsh inefficiencies on data sharing and utilization. The current mindset removes these inefficiencies and allows them to say \u201cyes\u201d to more projects and ideas.<\/p> <p>Rory will also demo how MediaMath uses Amazon Web Services and\u00a0Qubole\u00a0so that infrastructure is no longer a limiting factor on what and how users query. This combination allows them to scale their resources up and down as needed while bridging different data sources and execution engines.

Starting with a ruby application quickstart dockerfile, Thomas will cover some of the design decisions that they\u2019ve made to create production-ready docker images.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Our aim<\/b><\/p> <p>We\u2019d like to share our Docker knowledge and experience with developers, to showcase how to use Docker in production, along with how to build and deploy Dockerized web apps in a secure and automated way. This meetup aims to help developers who have already tried out Docker, who want to develop deeper knowledge of best practices for container management technologies.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why is it worth using Docker?<\/b><\/p> <p>More and more companies are increasingly moving their infrastructure to leverage Docker containers, allowing them to save time and money, while providing better flexibility and speed to market. Using container management technologies like Docker provides users with agility, scalability and portability of their web applications.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Who is this course designed for?<\/b><\/p> <p>This meetup is best suited for developers who:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0have used Docker in development but haven\u2019t yet moved it to production or<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0who have used Docker in production before and would like to learn more how to automate the whole process.<\/p> <p><br\/>A large portion of the workshop will focus on Habitus and Starter - two completely new, open source tools built for Docker orchestration.<\/p> <p><i>What is Habitus?<\/i><\/p> <p>Habitus is a standalone Docker build flow tool. It is a command line tool that builds Docker images based on their Dockerfile and a build.yml in a predictable and reproducible manner, with support for multiple steps based on best practices.<\/p> <p><i>What is Starter?<\/i><\/p> <p>Starter is a standalone Dockerfile generator for your existing non-docker apps. It will ask questions when it can not automatically detect dependencies and results in a Dockerfile and Service.yml that can be used to deploy immediately to Cloud 66.<\/p> <p><br\/>To get the most out of the presented content, it\u2019s recommended for participants to spend some time running through the basics of using Docker prior to attending the session.<\/p> <p>There are several \u2018getting started\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\">resources available online through the Docker website<\/a>, or alternatively, we suggest <a href=\"http:\/\/go.c66.me\/nymeetupp\">setting up a user account on Cloud 66<\/a>, which will provide access to quickstart tools, and a short practical video on how to deploy your first Docker stack to production using the Cloud 66 interface.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Who is Cloud 66?<\/b><\/p> <p>We <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloud66.com\/\">specialise in DevOps as a service<\/a>, providing everything you need to build, deploy and maintain any app, on your own servers, on any cloud.<\/p> <p><br\/>We do this by providing an easy to use deployment console, which reduces the barriers to entry for container adoption. Taking into account that Docker is still relatively new, Cloud 66 has already built up several years of container management expertise from working with users across all industries. We look forward to sharing this knowledge with you.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Using Cloud 66 and DigitalOcean?

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/228764854\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvdbvb","time":1455665400000,"updated":1455687820000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"More info on website","name":"Manhattan","lon":-74.005943,"id":24347930,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455139109000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I found an awesome DIY jewelry class!

What unconscious forces compel us to repeat the joyful and the traumatic events of our hidden family histories? This workshop will explore our profound, never-ending relationship to our past through the popular Family Constellations TM method developed by the German philosopher-psychologist Bert Hellinger.The goal of the Family Constellation approach is to gain insight into the secrets of our family history. This method teaches us how to unravel the skein of our family past, brings to light interconnections across generations, and helps us break out of the unconscious cycle of our family history that may keep us from reaching our true potential and experiencing real happiness.<br\/>The Family Constellation method effectively addresses:<br\/>-relationship problems<br\/>-career issues<br\/>-business and financial difficulties<br\/>-bodily pain and illness<br\/>-depression<br\/>-habitual emotional and behavioral patterns<br\/>Seminar leader Dina Ostrovsky.<br\/>More info at TERRApia.org<br\/>Payment $15 if you come to participate as a helper, $100 if you ask for your own constellation.

Airbnb may be a good choice to book unique accommodations. To better explore its rental listings across New York City, Amy Ma designed this app to answer some questions: How many of the listings are for an entire home versus a room in an apartment? How many are controlled by the same host? Why tax Issue is serious in Airbnb NYC? Should you think twice before trusting an review? Results also provide suggestions for Airbnb, hosts and visitors.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Sricharan Maddineni: <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp004_project\/Project2-Shiny\/Sri_New\/\">Why are Airports Important?\u00a0<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Aviation infrastructure has been a bedrock of the United States economy and culture for many decades, and I've created an interactive map to show the connectedness of US airports as well as a motion chart which shows the evolution of airline passengers vs population for the world's countries over the last four decades.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Christopher Redino: <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp004_project\/Project2-Shiny\/chris_redino\/\">Health Indicators and Geographic Factors <\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The World Health Organization lists obesity as one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Although genetics play a role in the likelihood of obesity in an individual, lifestyle (by choice or otherwise) is also an important factor that cannot be ignored. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene conducts an annual Community Health Survey (CHS) wherein they collect data on a variety of health factors from thousands of New Yorkers in all five boroughs. Some of this data is used in this app to visualize how large an effect our geography has on obesity rates, even on a scale as small as the span of a few miles between neighbourhoods in NYC.<\/p> <p>Which geographic factors are causing this difference in rates is somewhat an open question: is the availability of fresh food more important, or the median income of residents in a particular neighbourhood? In addition to visually exploring the survey data, the app allows the user to explore the effect of different types of food vendors on the obesity rate of different neighborhoods.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Wendy Yu: <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp004_project\/Project2-Shiny\/wendy_yu\/\">Interactive data visualization of gender pay gap in the United States<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Gender pay gap is a continuous problem in the United States. To date, women are still making about 20% less then their male counterparts. I collected data from United States Census Bureau and created an interactive app to explore changes of gender pay gap over the past decades.<\/p> <p><b>Michael Todisco: <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp004_project\/Project2-Shiny\/michael_todisco\/\">MLB 2012 Attendance <\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>This Shiny Application visualizes Major League Baseball attendance data for the 2012 season. A user can select any of the 30 teams in baseball and then interactively filter attendance data based on categories such as game time (day vs night), temperature, weather, promotion, and opponent's winning percentage. The results are displayed in four main graphs: 1) attendance vs opponent 2) attendance vs day of the week 3) attendance vs month 4) season trending attendance.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Brett Amdur: <a href=\"https:\/\/brettamdur.shinyapps.io\/regDiagnostics\/\">Understanding Regression Diagnostics: An Introduction <\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>For his Shiny project, Brett created an educational tool that uses visuals and interactivity to help explain the diagnostic tests that assess the validity of a regression analysis. The tool allows users to choose from among several different several data sets (most of which come from the well known Anscombe's Quartet) to see how their diagnostic plots differ. The tool also allows users to make adjustments to the data to see how changes in the data can influence the diagnostics.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Open-Data\/events\/228063117\/","yes_rsvp_count":76,"duration":7200000,"name":"Shiny Demo Meetup ","id":"228063117","time":1455667200000,"updated":1455676357000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369362644000,"name":"NYC Open Data","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":8619412,"urlname":"NYC-Open-Data","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Data Scientists and Open Data-er"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"148 W 24th St","name":"Barcade - Chelsea","lon":-73.994423,"id":24204630,"state":"NY","lat":40.744312,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.457230716944,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454086830000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's eat, drink and play video games!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Happy-Hour\/events\/228456723\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"Classic Video Games + Drinks","id":"228456723","time":1455667200000,"updated":1455691779000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1263851380000,"name":"Queer Happy Hour","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1584733,"urlname":"Queer-Happy-Hour","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453606872000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For our first meeting, we will meet and introduce ourselves.\u00a0 We will exchange ideas on topics that are helpful for our aspirations to live off the land, grow our own food, and arrange our lives that can balance this need for a healthier life with a career--if that matters to you.\u00a0 A few topics to ponder upon:<\/p> <p>- Location of the community:\u00a0 Where do you want to be?\u00a0 Somewhere close to NYC?\u00a0 Which county in upstate NY meets all your needs?<\/p> <p><br\/>- Homesteading skills: permaculture, biodynamic farming, animal husbandry, herbal medicine, wild plant identification etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>- Lifestyle choices: do you plan on living off the land full time or do you plan to have a place that you can return to during the weekend?<\/p> <p>- Home-building: Do you want to build your own house with local, sustainable materials?\u00a0 How much does it cost and what are the financing options?<\/p> <p>- Guiding principles: What guides your decision to move back to the land?\u00a0 Health, spiritual reasons etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>- Neighbors: Living in the woods can be challenging if you are doing this alone.\u00a0 Find some good neighbors with similar interests!<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Back-to-the-Land-Ecovillage-Movement\/events\/228316319\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Meet the Group: A Discussion on What it Means to Go \"Back to the Land\"","id":"228316319","time":1455667200000,"updated":1455679433000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1453170217000,"name":"New York Back-to-the-Land \/ Ecovillage Movement","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19363409,"urlname":"New-York-Back-to-the-Land-Ecovillage-Movement","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Community Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"161 W. 23rd Street","name":"Meridian 23","lon":-73.994804,"id":19702652,"state":"NY","lat":40.744041,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.483572274446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431118991000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Gumbo is actually my Jam session I host personally.

Which county in upstate NY meets all your needs? - Homesteading skills: permaculture, biodynamic farming, animal husbandry, herbal medicine, wild plant identification etc.<\/p> <p>- Lifestyle choices: do you plan on living off the land full time or do you plan to have a place that you can return to during the weekend?<\/p> <p>- Home-building: Do you want to build your own house with local, sustainable materials? How much does it cost and what are the financing options?<\/p> <p>- Guiding principles: What guides your decision to move back to the land?

It\u2019s good to have an open collaborative environment, but it also leads to exceedingly mushy situations, in which people don\u2019t have footing on who owns what or what rights and claims may emerge.\u00a0<\/p> <p>During this meetup we will address what can go very, very wrong without some legal activity at a hackathon, what precautionary measures can be taken during a hackathon to prevent unpleasant surprises, and what legal techniques can be used to set the right tone and expectations, and prevent small issues from spinning into huge, expensive battles down the road.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startups-Entrepreneurs-Legal-Group\/events\/228584589\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Hackathons \u2013 Possible Legal Issues & How to Avoid Them","id":"228584589","time":1455667200000,"updated":1455679468000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434637293000,"name":"Startups & Entrepreneurs Legal Group","group_lon":-74,"id":18682081,"urlname":"Startups-Entrepreneurs-Legal-Group","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Entrepreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":1.73755836487,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450215095000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":1},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Poetry-Table\/events\/228651347\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Let's Drink Wine and Write Poetry!","id":"dsjxmlyvdbvb","time":1455667200000,"updated":1455686770000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1383754837000,"name":"The Poetry Table","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":10994752,"urlname":"The-Poetry-Table","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Poets"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"454 Broome Street Buzzer 4a","name":"Circling Lab","lon":-74.000587,"id":23760774,"state":"NY","lat":40.722427,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.98817801476,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453314432000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this group, you'll learn new ways of communicating in order to share more vulnerably and openly, bring attention more fully to the present in order to discover the richness of whats happening in relationship with others, and begin to see and co-explore aspects of yourself you may have been unaware of before in service of greater self-understanding, expression and awareness.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

When the group was in Boston, the members all pledged to write something ambitious and potentially life changing, and that was such a rewarding experience. We even wrote and published a book called \"Seven At The Sevens,\" which is for sale on WritersAnonymous.org and Amazon. Also, if you do a Google search for \"Seven At The Sevens,\" it's the first item that pops up! While there, you can also find our NPR interview about the book. Although we ended up publishing a book, the group\u2019s main mission was about keeping each other\u2019s writing going and on track, and holding each writer accountable to his\/her own self-imposed but ambitious goals. The main purpose of WritersAnonymous.org was\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0about publishing a book or to have each other\u2019s writings critiqued, although that can and did happen.<\/p> <p>Further, WritersAnonymous is about being inspired by your peers and inspiring others to find their own voices. It is about connecting with people who have a similar passion in life and who may understand you a little better because they have the same burning desire to tell a story in whatever written form it may emerge. It is also about forging new and lasting friendships in a supportive and encouraging environment during the often lonely and difficult creative writing process.<\/p> <p>So, want to write and create something worthwhile, and also equally help others in their literary journeys?

These are the qualities that make nutraMetrix Isotonix supplements unlike any other nutritional supplements on the market today.\u00a0 Normally, when a vitamin or mineral supplement tablet is ingested, the body must work for up to four hours digesting and absorbing the nutrients. During this lengthy breakdown process, a percentage of the nutritive value is lost. nutraMetrix Isotonix nutraceuticals are powders; therefore, none of the fillers, gelatin capsules, binders, coatings and lubricants common to tablet manufacturing are necessary. As a result, the amount of time and work necessary to absorb a supplement is greatly decreased.\u00a0 Stop by and listen to Michael Zupp, health and wellness coach, explain the advantages of nutrametrix vs. the competition.<\/p> <p><br\/>Business owners, managers, and salespeople learn about each other's business and we share referrals.\u00a0 First time attending?

It's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I haven't come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"I met Ayelet at a Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>The meditation helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships. The meditation she led was life changing for me.\"- Annie Yang, NYC<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Once you make your $2 payment you will receive an access code to enter the webinar.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Life-Transformers\/events\/228734656\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"A Guided Meditation to Control Your Thoughts & Emotions","id":"ppvhqlyvdbwb","time":1455735600000,"updated":1455935421000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337054153000,"name":"Transform Your Life: ATTRACT Goals, Relationships, SUCCESS","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3867642,"urlname":"The-Life-Transformers","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"The Life Transformers"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events?and_text=False&country=us&offset=3&city=New+York&format=json&limited_events=False&access_token=12871c669318169b8d72da532c30aec7&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&status=past&desc=False","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":8719,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":799,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
