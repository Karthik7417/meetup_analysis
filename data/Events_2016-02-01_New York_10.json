This will be the first such museum exhibition in the United States in nearly half a century.<\/p> <p>Over the course of his long career, Picasso devoted himself to sculpture wholeheartedly, if episodically, using both traditional and unconventional materials and techniques. Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status for Picasso. He approached the medium with the freedom of a self-taught artist, ready to break all the rules. This attitude led him to develop a deep fondness for his sculptures, to which the many photographs of his studios and homes bear witness. Treating them almost as members of his household, he cherished the sculptures' company and enjoyed re-creating them in a variety of materials and situations. Picasso kept the majority in his private possession during his lifetime. It was only in 1966, through the large Paris retrospective Hommage \u00e0 Picasso, that the public became fully aware of this side of his work. Following that exhibition, in 1967 The Museum of Modern Art organized The Sculpture of Picasso, which until now was the first and only exhibition on this continent to display a large number of the artist\u2019s sculptures.<\/p> <p>Picasso Sculpture focuses on the artist\u2019s lifelong work with sculpture, with a particular focus on his use of materials and processes. The exhibition, which features more than 100 sculptures, complemented by selected works on paper and photographs, aims to advance the understanding of what sculpture was for Picasso, and of how he revolutionized its history through a lifelong commitment to constant reinvention. The exhibition is organized in chapters corresponding to the distinct periods during which Picasso devoted himself to sculpture, each time exploring with fresh intensity the modern possibilities of this ancient art form.<\/p> <p>Click here to purchase: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.showclix.com\/event\/picasso-sculpture\">Timed tickets<\/a> are required for entry to Picasso Sculpture.<\/p> <p>Picasso Sculpture timed tickets include general admission to the Museum.<\/p> <p>Visitors are strongly encouraged to present their ticket on their mobile device or print their online tickets at home for expedited entry.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to arrive anytime during the half hour after your selected time (for example, if your ticket is for 11:00 a.m., plan to arrive anytime between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m.)<\/p> <p>Please note that there is a $1.50 per ticket ShowClix service charge for reserving timed tickets in advance.<\/p> <p>A limited number of general admission timed tickets will be available for same-day sales depending on capacity on a given day.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Getting there:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you wish to join me for the travel: I will be heading down for this event on the train.

I love giving readings with them and teaching others to do the same. I do not however believe that the process should be long and overbearing. Many classes offered today either lack the depth of knowledge needed to read and leave you to do all the work on your own or are many days long with little knowledge gained except for memorization. You should not ever have to memorize, in fact that can inhibit the reading process all together.\u00a0 I take all of the nonsense out and give you what you need from purchasing, cleansing, reading, and caring for your cards in just the\u00a0three hours. We will go over the basic spreads and finish with creating your own! We will end with reading each other!<\/p> <p>I have added an extra hour to this class to allow for more hands on\/ practical application time.

I was surprised at how much helpful information I walked away with. We started with a meditation that opened us to receive divine messages of inspiration.

From beginners to seasoned pros, it is the foundation of a digital photographer's workflow, the place to both start and finish all of your photographs. This is a full day, hands-on workshop on everything you need to know to to get you up and running with Adobe Lightroom.

Any workflow, from beginner to professional, has three components, Input, throughput and output. Lightroom was custom designed to provide for all three of these essential parts of workflow, Input (ingesting new images and organizing them (Digital Asset Management), throughput (processing\/developing the files) and output (sharing by social media, personal website or email and printing). In this 6-hour workshop, Cliff will provide an overview of all of these features, briefly demonstrating how they were designed to be used. By the end of this class, when you open up Lightroom, it will makes sense, you will know where to start and feel comfortable diving in . \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/cKW7CFSMseY1XDLqopPMO9zhw1nu3_cj6dwiOTpp42VNuIRfPK-fVt9KZFOnBIiKkauNce9vWv3xCPcePkKM3lVY5yw7WOh8vdmNyrfl3Tlffb66M7WMyFr5rKHfuOsZ1d9VHkWT\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/cKW7CFSMseY1XDLqopPMO9zhw1nu3_cj6dwiOTpp42VNuIRfPK-fVt9KZFOnBIiKkauNce9vWv3xCPcePkKM3lVY5yw7WOh8vdmNyrfl3Tlffb66M7WMyFr5rKHfuOsZ1d9VHkWT<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/galleries.cliffordpickett.com\/Before-after\/\"><b>Click here<\/b><\/a> for a gallery of some of Cliff\u2019s recent work, showcasing what is possible using\u00a0Lightroom to it\u2019s full potential. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This class is the first class in a two-part series.

He is based in NYC but his work takes him around the globe. He first picked up a camera while spending a year traveling through Europe after having earned his MBA early. Like many travelers, that passion for seeing and experiencing the world is precisely what ignited the spark for photography. Clifford has since spent all of his time learning how to see and capture the world with what he refers to as \"a new mind\". He hasn't been shooting for 40 years, he hasn't been alive for 40 years. He hasn't been classically trained in the fine arts either. He is entirely self-taught, which has formed within him his greatest asset: the ability to relate to the amateur photographer. Leveraging both the business and photography skills he has developed and maintained for over a decade, he is the owner of several successful photographic enterprises and a corporate commercial video production company working with clients such as Google, Apple, Adidas, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Sephora and Clinique. His work has been featured in National Geographic, the smithsonian, and many other publications. \u00a0To see some of Cliff\u2019s work, you may visit his website at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cliffordpickett.com\">www.cliffordpickett.com<\/a>.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/1Ua36IqnvahUOi-rf6etYJ6vi_jEqLSXpxqaArx5cc4ddkFOM0ZumqMQx-4g85NnvxFUGeGM_Q2ZIJF_1Cjv8Tz7l-NuTeneGePx2CGjJ0_AmI6OjEg84_RWNSuikaiBbkOEnoo\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/1Ua36IqnvahUOi-rf6etYJ6vi_jEqLSXpxqaArx5cc4ddkFOM0ZumqMQx-4g85NnvxFUGeGM_Q2ZIJF_1Cjv8Tz7l-NuTeneGePx2CGjJ0_AmI6OjEg84_RWNSuikaiBbkOEnoo<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCDPW\/events\/227677299\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":25200000,"name":"Adobe Lightroom Boot Camp 2016 - Day One","id":"227677299","time":1454169600000,"updated":1454196044000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1311162680000,"name":"NYC Digital Photography Workshops","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":2203141,"urlname":"NYCDPW","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452296974000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello all, we will be holding weekend student group hours on Saturday January 30th.

That means that the start of our next series - the Foundations of Mindfulness will begin the following Saturday, February 6th.<\/p> <p>This week we wrap up our conversations on The Ten Perfections and take a look at Equanimity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Many of us eventually realize during our search for peace and happiness that it doesn\u2019t matter if we attach ourselves to things we believe will bring us happiness or strongly avoid things we believe will deny us happiness.\u00a0 Neither of those strategies lead to lasting satisfaction and we can be easily tossed around between the two.\u00a0<\/p> <p>With skillful attention, patience, wisdom and clear vision of these sometime dueling mind states, we can come to understand that their interplay is always changing. This becomes our portal into the reality of impermanence. From that insight we can start seeing the opportunities we have\u00a0to settle in the middle; being more even tempered, centered or balanced in our responses because we come from a place of knowing or wisdom. Equanimity is the manifestation of that wisdom.<\/p> <p>There is one \u201cnear enemy\u201d of equanimity that can be tricky - indifference. It masquerades as equanimity, so we must use our skillful, vigilant attention and courage to be the peaceful balance of equanimity itself. The traditional phrase of the equanimity meditation offered by Joseph Goldstein reminds us of the way:\u00a0 \u201cI am the heir of my own actions, my happiness and unhappiness depends on my actions, not upon on my wishes.\u201d<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

While I quietly mourned the passing of Ktown's Arirang and its delicious handmade noodles. Fortunately, Dadam's simple menu of Korean broths and soupy noodle dishes has arrived to help fill that hole in my culinary life. I ordered the seafood soup noodle dish and was soon slurping down the thin, chewy noodles colorfully tinged with different colors. The broth was very light but still flavorful. I was also given the opportunity to sample the pumpkin soup, which proved itself a wonderfully hearty, warming dish. It is especially satisfying\u00a0with\u00a0winter weather arrives in force.

Employing three consistent components \u2014figure, ground, and line\u2014Lasker\u2019s careful arrangement of abstracted elements challenges one\u2019s usual reaction to non-representational painting, positioning the viewer in an unexpected discourse with form and space, foreground and background, objecthood and artifice. As Lasker describes, his paintings are meant to \u201cmake the viewer see him or herself in the act of viewing,\u201d drawing attention to \u201chow we construct a picture in our mind.\u201d By positioning various forms and patterns\u2014 through repetition, segmentation, and layering\u2014to visually recede or advance in pictorial space, Lasker composes illusionary \u201cpictures\u201d which are at once ambiguous and decisive. Recurring figural motifs repeat throughout the paintings, acting as a sort of abstract visual vocabulary. Paralleling linguistic concepts, Lasker uses these \u201csigns\u201d to set up various dialogues and spatial relationships which the viewer, as if following clues, is intended to decipher. Often, a thickly rendered motif is echoed by its separate, less tactile outline; the two forms reverberate together but seem to exist on different planes, much as the missing piece of a puzzle is mimicked by its empty shape. In other works, the prominent inclusion of Lasker\u2019s signature or initials heightens the tension between illusion and reality: dimensionality is mocked by the stubborn literalness of the painting\u2019s two-dimensional surface.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>3rd stop: DRISCOLL BABCOCK GALLERY (525 W 25th St) presents: E.

It is said that when word of Webster\u2019s death reached Paris, Picasso shed a tear; closer to home, Edward Hopper, one of Webster\u2019s neighbors in Provincetown, paused to remember a painter in whom he \u201ccould find no flaw.\u201d Later Richard Diebenkorn wrote that \u201cWebster committed himself uncompromisingly to the Paris experience and found his own stride within it\u2026 he could achieve weight as well as brilliance.\u201d<\/p> <p>Webster [masked]) was among the first and most forceful modern American painters, and he created some of the most adventurous paintings of his time. In a dynamic career spanning forty years, he traveled widely in Europe, North Africa, the Azore Islands, Jamaica and Bermuda, chasing the sun-drenched color that would inform his own high-keyed palette and superb expression of light. From the heat of his tropical canvases to the crispness of his New England snowscapes, Webster developed a compellingly original landscape idiom.<\/p> <p><b>4th stop: PACE WIDELSTEIN GALLERY (534 W 25th St) presents: IRVING PENN, PERSONAL WORK<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/6\/b\/600_446345227.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>a survey of privately produced, uncommissioned photographs by the iconic American photographer Irving Penn (1917\u20132009). A companion to Irving Penn: On Assignment, presented by the galleries in 2013, the exhibition and its counterpart collectively offer a retrospective glance at the breadth of achievement of Penn\u2019s legendary seven decade career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Probably the most prolific and respected photographer of the 20th century, Irving Penn is celebrated for his innovative commercial imagery and groundbreaking editorial contributions to Cond\u00e9 Nast publications. In addition to his professional assignments, however, Penn pursued a variety of personal projects \u2013 such as nudes, self-portraits, signage, moving light portraits, and still lifes of seemingly inconsequential objects \u2013 to maintain an artistic balance throughout his career.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>5th stop: MARY BOONE GALLERY (541 W 24th St) presents: JUDITH BERNSTEIN, DICKS OF DEATH<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/6\/8\/600_446332840.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0Dicks of Death, a Marine nickname for the processed beef franks included with beans, is so termed for its foul taste and similarity in appearance to male genitalia. The offensively flavored and phallic shaped food is Government Issue, served to soldiers in ready-to-eat rations. Bernstein lifts this term to zero-in on the war-time phallus and to show us how aggression and patriotism is institutionally packaged to fuel political conflict. This exhibition couples Bernstein\u2019s politicized phallic paintings (begun in 1966), Screw Drawings (begin in 1973), and her more recent work Star Spangled Boner. In Union Jack-Off (1967), Bernstein twists red saturated canvas into five bending phalluses. Emerging from a striped ground, these musty and mottled cocks both interrupt and fuse to the traditional patriotic motif. Next to the sexually expressive shapes, Bernstein scrawls \u201cUnion Jack-Off on U.S. Policy in Viet.\u201d However, white spew obstructs the yellow colored slogan, an irruption that connects to the artist\u2019s interest in scatological mark making. With each gesture and successive expression, Bernstein merges masculinity and patriotism to reveal how one inflates and supports the other. The works in this exhibition deploy willfully low artistic strategies \u2013 kitsch and graffiti \u2013 to disrupt any clean image of policy. The continued engagement with screws and cocks closes in on the machinery of the military industrial complex. Central to Bernstein\u2019s work is the morphing of body parts into these political tools. Judith Bernstein is a celebrated artist, whose work has both utilized and undermined strategies of Pop since the 1960s. This exhibition reconsiders her investigation into the blurred distinction between patriotism and masculinity and the absorption of aggression into everyday politics.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>6th stop: BRUCE SILVERSTEIN GALLERY (535 w 24th St) presents: PENELOPE UMBRICO, SILVERY LIGHT<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/8\/4\/600_446332868.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>new photographic and video works related to her continued practice of utilizing the limitless archive of photographic images online. This new work investigates projective and reflective light in relation to the history of photography, digital imaging technologies, and the screen as light source.<\/p> <p>In the front gallery, Umbrico has installed the video piece\u00a0Four Photographs of Rays of Sunlight in Grand Central\u2026, a collection of hundreds of iterations the artist found online of the iconic black and white photograph of sun rays through windows at Grand Central Station. Umbrico identified four versions of this original image of Grand Central Station, repeated over multiple websites selling the images as posters or vintage prints, treated with different color filters, cropping, and \u201cwatermarks.\u201d For each of these images she attempts to find the attribution, which, on these sites, is as varied as the aesthetic treatments to which the images have been subjected.<\/p> <p>In the back gallery, Umbrico turns to the photo-sharing website Flickr to explore how the full moon is photographed and shared.\u00a0Everyone\u2019s Photos Any License; Screenshot[masked]\u00a0is a screenshot from her computer of every image tagged \u201cfull moon\u201d on Flickr (1,146,034 images total), which Umbrico produced as a single print running the length of the gallery. The individual subjective experience of witnessing and photographing the moon is revealed as a collective practice, seen re-contextualized in its entirety, with new impact and effect.<\/p> <p><b>7th stop: LUHRING AUGUSTINE GALLERY (531 W 24th St) presents: GUIDO van der WERVE, THE PRESENT MOMENT<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/d\/b\/600_446332955.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0three-channel video installation exploring the different states of mind that compose our consciousness, and that we all employ every day to navigate the outer world.\u00a0 The work is shot against a stark black background in a purely psychological space, featuring three separate groups of individuals, all of whom populate the workings of the artist\u2019s interior mind. As the individuals perform essential and mindfulness tasks, human emotions are put on display and reduced to sheer mechanics, an aspect further explored through the mechanics of the camera and musical composition. The three videos investigate the three levels of consciousness: id, ego, and superego.<\/p> <p>The film is strictly structured on several axes of time: days, months, years. There are twelve acts, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. The camera motions (synchronized through all three screens) during each act follow the schematic line drawings of the twelve zodiacal constellations presented at the beginning of each act. The existential mood of the work is made more tender by the musical score written by Guido, a paean written in twelve parts in the twelve major keys; a recording of Guido playing emanates from a player piano in the center of the gallery, a surrogate for the artist in this first film in which he does not physically appear.<\/p> <p>*and* ROGER HIORNS, SCULPTURES<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/d\/e\/600_446332958.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The sculptures feature engines coated with the organic compound copper sulphate, a chemical with an unpredictable reactive potential, which Hiorns has employed to transform mass-produced objects into aesthetic entities; a seemingly redemptive gesture exploring the opposition between the natural and man-made. By anthropomorphizing the objects through anatomical references, Hiorns continues to explore the transposable relationship between man and manufactured product in his sculptures, reducing the human figure into representative signs and totems.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>8th stop: ANDREW KREPS GALLERY (537 W 22nd St) presents: ROBERT MELEE, SEMI-QUASI-BOWER RECREATIONAL<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/7\/3\/600_446333363.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Melee continues his investigation of the psychology of the everyday. Often incorporating cast-off quotidian items in his works alongside vividly colored poured paint, Melee points towards a melancholy specific to domestic space, one that is derived simultaneously from familiarity, decoration, and otherness.<\/p> <p>At the exhibition\u2019s center is\u00a0Bower Pool, a new installation that envelops the gallery\u2019s architecture. Drawing its name from Bower birds, who construct lavish, colorful nests as part of a mating ritual, Melee\u2019s installation employs a commercially available above ground pool, overturned and surrounding a column. Streamers, party favors, lights, and gold decorations spill out on the floor, representing an obsessive accumulation. While these low-budget materials root the installation in kitsch, they also ground it within a compulsion for embellishment, and its failed transformative quality. Initially overpowering in its scale, upon closer inspection,\u00a0Bower Pool\u00a0soon reveals its components for what they are, the deflated markers of celebration.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bonus\/ellective stop: SIKKEMA JENKIND GALLERY (530 W 22nd) presents: POSCARDS FROM THE EDGE, a benefit for VISUAL AIDS ($5.00 donation\/admission; we can see this now or at end of tour)<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/f\/a\/600_446333498.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>9th stop: \u00a0PAULA COOPER GALLERY (521 W 21st St) presents: JONATHAN BOROFSKY, RETROSPECTIVE<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/3\/f\/600_446345439.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>painting and sculpture from 1967\u20131983.<\/p> <p><br\/>Borofsky came to prominence in the New York art world of the mid-1970s, \u201chitting the stagnant art scene [\u2026] like a blast of crazy, fresh air.\u201d<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paulacoopergallery.com\/exhibitions\/jonathan-borofsky-2016-01-27\/press-release#fn:1\">1<\/a>\u00a0In a period dominated by the detached ethos of Minimalism and Conceptualism, the artist developed a highly personal style that emphasized the emotive and fantastical recesses of human consciousness.

In these etchings Goya illustrates the brutality of human behavior to comment on oppressive social conditions in eighteenth century Spanish culture. Pittman offers vignettes in the form of painting as a vehicle to address a broad range of social political issues, updating and renewing Goya\u2019s\u00a0Caprichos\u00a0as a contemporary response to increasing levels of violence collectively internalized.<\/p> <p>In place of Goya\u2019s staunchly critical voice, Pittman aligns his subjects with language from Emily Dickinson, employing the poet\u2019s voice to express a secular vision of the body, pain, and death. Pittman sees in Dickinson\u2019s proto-feminist writing a secular vehicle to ruminate on larger philosophical issues of contemporary trauma, while not essentializing pain for herself or within her body.<\/p> <p><b>11th stop: GAGOSIAN GALLERY (522 W 21st St) presents: GREGORY CREWDSON, CATHERDRAL OF THE PINES<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/f\/3\/600_446333747.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>was made during three productions in and around the rural town of Becket, Massachusetts. In images that recall nineteenth-century American and European paintings, Crewdson photographed figures in the surrounding forests, including the actual trail from which the series takes its title. Interior scenes charged with ambiguous narratives probe tensions between art, life, connection and separation, intimacy and isolation.<\/p> <p>The series comprises thirty-one digital pigment prints, each measuring 45 \u00d7 58 inches framed. In\u00a0Woman at Sink, a woman pauses from her household upkeep, lost in thought. In\u00a0Pickup Truck, Crewdson portrays a nude couple in the flatbed of a truck in a dense forest\u2014the woman seated, the man turned away in repose. Crewdson situates his disconsolate subjects in familiar settings, yet their cryptic actions\u2014standing still in the snow, or nude on a riverbank\u2014hint at invisible challenges. Precisely what these challenges are, and what fate awaits these anonymous figures, are left to the viewer's imagination.<\/p> <p><b>12th stop: \u00a0DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (537 W 20th St) presents: DOUG WHEELER, ENCASEMENTS<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/5\/d\/600_446333853.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This exhibition represents the most comprehensive presentation to date of this important body of work, and will comprise\u00a0five \u201cencasements,\u201d including a rarely seen \u201ccenter light\u201d work. Presented here in an open configuration, viewers will have the unprecedented opportunity to consider these singular works in relation to one another and to compare the distinct luminous atmospheric effects and subtle tonal variations that characterize each of them. Previously, no more than two encasements have been shown together, as in exhibitions at Fort Worth Art Center Museum, Texas (1969), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1969), and Tate Gallery, London (1970), and accordingly this exhibition aims to underscore their ongoing\u00a0significance.<\/p> <p>A pioneering figure in what is often referred to as the Light and Space movement in Los Angeles during the 1960s and 1970s, Wheeler is noted for his innovative constructions and installations that manipulate the perception and experience of space, volume, and light. First conceived\u00a0between 1967 and 1969, the artist\u2019s \u201clight encasements\u201d evolved out of his longstanding\u00a0experimentations with fabricated acrylic and neon, and consist of large panels of vacuum-formed plastic with neon lighting embedded along their inside edges. Installed in a white room with all architectural detail and ambient light eliminated, the light paintings appear to dematerialize, immersing viewers in a luminous space where light seems to have almost particulate mass.<\/p> <p><b>13th Stop: JONATHAN LEVINE GALLERY (529 W 20th St) presents: INTERESNI KAZKI, SACRED GRAVITATION<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/c\/1\/600_446333185.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Interesni Kazki have been painting together for over 15 years and are pioneers of the graffiti movement in Eastern Europe. With an aesthetic that has evolved from traditional graffiti writing to allegorical and figurative compositions, their work invites viewers to consider the spiritual side of the universe.\u00a0When translated to English their name means\u00a0Interesting Fairytale. Renowned for their imaginative imagery - inspired by science, religion, mythology, folklore and history - each piece is created in an attempt to look beyond the bounds of what is visible and present a new perception of the world. The new body of work presented in Sacred Gravitation comprises intricately detailed paintings and drawings that merge physical and spiritual elements reflecting on the nature of existence.<\/p> <p>\n\n*and* DALEK, THE REDISTRIBUTION OF DESTRUCTION<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/c\/9\/600_446333193.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>marks Marshall\u2019s return to the New York art world after a five year hiatus during which he perfected a purely abstract aesthetic. Bold, flat colors form planes of space that are impeccably separated by precise geometric line-work. Giving the impression of movement, his pairing of vivid shades evoke a three-dimensional depth and engages viewers with varying optical perspectives.<\/p> <p>Marshall\u2019s work has significantly evolved since his debut solo show at the gallery back in 2007. At the time he was known solely as Dalek and his iconic Space Monkey, a mischievous character born out of graffiti, was featured in every vibrant composition. By 2010, he dropped the Dalek moniker to reveal his true name and debuted paintings that reduced the Space Monkey and his surroundings to their basic underlying linear components.<\/p> <p><b>14th stop: ANTORN KERN GALLERY (532 W 20th) presents: FRANCIS UPRITCHARD &amp; MARTINO GAMPER, INSTALLATION<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/b\/600_446340923.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Wife and husband and frequent collaborators, Francis Upritchard and Martino Gamper bring together contrasting approaches to the making of three-dimensional objects. Upritchard is a sculptress from New Zealand with an extensive history of museum and gallery exhibitions, and Gamper an Italian designer with a wide and fascinating array of design exhibitions and commissions.<\/p> <p>Their first joint exhibition at the gallery will blend sculpture and furniture in such a seamless way that genre or category seems temporarily thrown overboard. Upritchard and Gamper play with ideas of origin and derivation by combining figures, artifacts and pseudo-anthropological objects with newly designed as well as re-appropriated furniture, denying every concept of cultural purity and authenticity.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>15th Stop: DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (533 W 19th St) presents: MARCEL DZAMA and \u00a0RAYMOND PETTIBON, FORGETTING THE HAND<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/c\/f\/600_446333967.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0this is the first time the pair has worked together.

In a variation of the \u201cexquisite corpse\u201d method in which a partner is only given portions of an otherwise concealed drawing to work on, Dzama and Pettibon developed each other\u2019s compositions through illustrations, collage, and writing. Just as the surrealists invented the technique in the early twentieth century as a playful and ultimately enriching exercise, the present drawings combine the two artists\u2019 distinct styles in a revealing and often seamless fashion. In several works, it is almost impossible to determine who made what, which indicates how both strove to assimilate the other\u2019s vision or anticipate his response.<\/p> <p><b>16th stop: DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (525 W 19th St) presents: YUTAKA SONE, DAY AND NIGHT\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/d\/d\/600_446333981.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Sone\u2019s work revolves around a tension between realism and perfection. A conceptual framework, paired with a meticulous attention to detail, has characterized his practice since the early 1990s, informing equally his self-contained jungle environments, life-size roller coasters, magnified snowflakes, and staged events. His sculptural works in particular attest to a profound interest in landscapes, whether natural or architectural, and their extraordinary ability to capture light relates them to a genre primarily associated with painting and photography.<\/p> <p>The exhibition features a new group of canvases depicting scenes at night. The motifs were taken from the artist\u2019s large-scale, white marble sculptures and respectively show an amusement park roller coaster, Los Angeles highway intersection, and Hong Kong and Manhattan cityscapes. With their black backdrops illuminated by brightly painted artificial lights, the paintings contrast with the purity of their sculptural counterparts, yet similarly present their subjects as archetypal landscapes somehow unaffected by the life that circulates within them.<\/p> <p>The marble sculpture\u00a0<i>Movie Theater\u00a0<\/i>(2013) continues Sone\u2019s interest in rendering light in three dimensions. For his earlier\u00a0<i>Light in between Trees\u00a0<\/i>series (2010), shards of light surrounding snowcapped trees or stumps were given physical form, welding abstract and figurative shapes. Here, a beam emerging from a projection window materializes into a large triangular geometrical object hovering over the audience as a roof.<\/p> <p>Also on view are life-sized sculptures of palm trees, which embody the ongoing dialogue within Sone\u2019s oeuvre between natural and man-made structures.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>FEE: $5.00 for regular members; FREE for full-paid members! <\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet us out front of MITCHELL-INNES & NASH GALLERY","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GuySocialNyc\/events\/228355965\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"duration":14400000,"name":"GUY GALLERY WALK: JANUARY EDITION","id":"228355965","time":1454176800000,"updated":1454191976000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383018152000,"name":"GUY SOCIAL NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10885132,"urlname":"GuySocialNyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"GUYS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10607","country":"us","city":"Elmsford","phone":"914-721-8200","address_1":"300 Tarrytown Road","name":"Greenburgh Public Library","lon":-73.792575,"id":1427554,"state":"NY","lat":41.041515,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.6734638214,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453742594000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Try two, due to the blizzard!<br\/>Join us for writing, stay because we got snowed in again.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Local History Room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Geeks\/events\/228349776\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Westchester Geeks Writer's Guild - January 2016","id":"228349776","time":1454176800000,"updated":1454185437000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246218270000,"name":"WESTCHESTER GEEKS","group_lon":-73.75,"id":1481036,"urlname":"Westchester-Geeks","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Geeks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11226","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"1616 Caton Ave","address_2":"Coney Island Ave between Caton & Parkside Avenues","lon":-73.964798,"phone":"(718) 965-8973 ","name":"Prospect Park Parade Grounds","id":832326,"state":"NY","lat":40.650828,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":6.99254369736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1415465910000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>****READ THIS FIRST ||\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BklynPickupSoccer\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49437931\">Parade Grounds Game Standards<\/a>\u00a0****<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/d\/1\/600_444952945.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>We are meeting at 1 PM to shovel the 18 yard box.

Nitrox is another tool for divers to use. It is not designed to replace air. Nitrox is ideal for recreational diving. You can gain a safety advantage OR longer bottom times using Nitrox. In either case, many divers report less fatigue and a sense of well-being after Nitrox dives.\u00a0<br\/>In addition to feeling better after diving, the decrease of of nitrogen accumulation also allows:<\/p> <p>Increased safety margins when using dive computers.<\/p> <p>A significant increase in bottom time no-decompression limits when using Nitrox tables.<\/p> <p>A reduction of decompression time if the no-decompression limits are exceeded.<\/p> <p>A reduction of possible decompression illness.<\/p> <p>Reduces the effects of Nitrogen Narcosis.<\/p> <p><br\/>What is Nitrox?\u00a0<br\/>Nitrox is simply any mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Air is made up of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. The name \"Nitrox\" usually refers to oxygen-nitrogen mixtures containing more than 21% oxygen. Other names for this gas are EANx, Enriched Air Nitrox and Safe Air. There are two standard Nitrox mixtures. Nitrox containing 32% oxygen and Nitrox containing 36% oxygen.<\/p> <p>Why should I use Nitrox?\u00a0<br\/>The main benefit to diving with Nitrox is the reduced amount of nitrogen in your breathing gas. Less nitrogen means less risk of getting decompression sickness (DCS), or \"the bends\". Using Nitrox can also extend your bottom time. Because no-decompression limits are based on nitrogen absorption, less nitrogen means more bottom time. Many divers also claim that they feel less fatigued after diving with Nitrox (as compared to diving with air).<\/p> <p>Why do I need a Nitrox Course?\u00a0<br\/>Nitrox, like all other breathing gases (including air), has its safe limits at depth so it is very important to know and understand these limits before you make your first Nitrox dive. You will also need a Nitrox Certification card to purchase mixed gases. To fully understand the benefits of using Nitrox it is important to receive proper training. Classroom sessions include information on the theory of diving Nitrox, blending, dive tables, gas analyzing and dive planning. Upon completion you will receive your certification allowing you to use Nitrox for all your diving adventures.<\/p> <p>In addition to feeling better after diving, the decrease of of nitrogen accumulation also allows:\u00a0<br\/>- Increased safety margins when using computers.\u00a0<br\/>- A significant increase in bottom time no-decompression limits when using Dive Computer Nitrox plan.\u00a0<br\/>- A reduction of possible decompression illness.\u00a0<br\/>- A reduction of decompression time if the no-decompression limits are exceeded.\u00a0<br\/>- Reduces the effects of Nitrogen Narcosis.<\/p> <p>Nitrox Equipment\u00a0<br\/>Most of your regular scuba equipment will work without modification for use with Nitrox. Your regulator, pressure hoses and other equipment will work just fine.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"2nd floor rear behind SPRINT","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/scuba-nj\/events\/228392078\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"EZ Nitrox Course","id":"228392078","time":1454178600000,"updated":1454190528000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1186630197000,"name":"NJ  Scuba Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":610888,"urlname":"scuba-nj","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Aquanauts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"212-243-1199","address_1":"32 West 25th Street","name":"The Dog Spa ","lon":-73.990681,"id":928266,"state":"NY","lat":40.743399,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.458443790674,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1399246455000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This playdate is for dogs 20lbs and under and their owners to get together to socialize, share advice, and have fun!

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<\/p> <p>Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern\u2014and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<\/p> <p>An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees\u2014how they approach worker safety\u2014and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<\/p> <p>What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.<\/p> <p>They succeeded by transforming habits.<\/p> <p>In\u00a0The Power of Habit,\u00a0award-winning\u00a0New York Times\u00a0business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.<\/p> <p>Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation\u2019s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<\/p> <p>At its core,\u00a0The Power of Habit\u00a0contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.<\/p> <p>Habits aren\u2019t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>-From\u00a0charlesduhigg.com<\/p> <p>You can also find this book at\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Power-Habit-What-Business\/dp\/081298160X\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Power-Habit-What-Business\/dp\/081298160X\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Power-Habit-What-Business\/dp\/081298160X<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>UPDATES:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Agenda<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2pm-2:15pm<\/b> Meet and Greet\/ Socialize (feel free to grab some drinks or snacks from the coffee stand in the atrium or bring your own food; I might bake some cookies but no guarantee\u2026)\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2:15pm-2:30pm<\/b> A Brief Introduction\/ Summary of the Book\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2:30pm-3:30pm<\/b> Book Discussion (please see the questions post below)\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>3:30pm-4pm<\/b> Wrap-up\/ Socialize\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Book Discussion Questions:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>1) The author writes that it is possible to reawaken a habit, and that habits never disappear, but are changed by new cues, routines, or rewards. Describe a habit of yours that has been changed or replaced. Do you agree or disagree that this habit can be reawakened? Why? What would it take to reawaken your habit?\u00a0<\/p> <p>2) The chapter breaks down several behaviors into habit loops, including running, eating, and cleaning. Think about how you exercise, eat, or clean. What are your cues, rewards, and cravings for these activities? Which ones are the same and which ones are different from those described in the chapter?\u00a0<\/p> <p>3) Why are habits so hard to change? Think about a time when you have tried to change one of your habits. Was it hard? Were you successful? If so, how did you do it? If not, what should you have done differently?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Can individuals change their habits without the support of a group?\u00a0<\/p> <p>5) What are keystone habits? What are some keystone habits in your life\/organizations\/ companies you are a part of? Are there any you would like to change? Why are keystone habits important? How do they become meaningful?\u00a0<\/p> <p>6) Can you recognize shopping habits in yourself? Do you turn right most often in the grocery store? Do you purchase your veggies first and junk food later on during a shopping trip? Had you ever thought about your grocery habits before?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>7) Ironically, when marketers manipulate human behavior to earn profits, it is considered an achievement of capitalism. However, if a psychologist manipulates human behavior to study the process of decision making, it might be considered unethical. Why don\u2019t advertisers and marketers need to abide by the same ethical standards when it comes to manipulation of behavior? Is it ethical for corporations to collect data about your shopping habits without your consent? Why or why not?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Special Thanks to\u00a0SF book club's organizer,\u00a0Anabel H, as a mentor coaching and\u00a0guiding\u00a0me on organizing our first Meetup!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will be sitting at one of the tables with Meetup sign.

The holidays may be over but winter in New York maintains its own seasonal charms so we'll take in\u00a0some classic Old New York Bars in the Gramercy area.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll start the day off at<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mollysshebeen.com\/welcome.html\"> Molly's Shebeen<\/a>, arguably New York's most traditional Irish pub. Molly's was opened in 1960 in a building that first opened as a bar in 1895. Its rustic Irish cottage theme, which dates to 1964, features sawdust on the floor and a wood-burning fireplace. Both the fireplace and the Honduran mahogany bar date to Molly's original late-19th century incarnation.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/5\/a\/600_433897978.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIrish folk band The Clancy Brothers and Irish writer Brendan Behan were regulars here in Molly's early days. Singer Diana Krall wrote several of her songs from a booth here.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/6\/9\/600_433897993.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nFrom there, we'll proceed half a block down 3rd Avenue to <a href=\"http:\/\/rolfsnyc.com\/www.rolfsnyc.com\/Welcome.html\">Rolf's German Restaurant<\/a>. Rolf's has been a Gramercy Park fixture since 1968, when it was opened by Rolf Hoffman. Gramercy Park was a German neighborhood for many years. But it wasn't until Bob Maisano and Ben House\u00a0 took over the place after Hoffman's death in 1981 that Christmas at Rolf's started to become a New York City tradition. They started small with decorations found at any discount store. But every year they added more and more and eventually replaced the dime-store decorations with high-end ornaments bought from New England antique stores. House passed away in 1996, but Maisano has continued the tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/f\/600_431822239.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt's not Christmas time anymore but Rolf's is still a Black Forest Winter Wonderland this time of year.<\/p> <p><br\/>After Rolf's we'll head towards Union Square to visit two of New York's best old bars:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.petestavern.com\/\"> Pete's Tavern<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oldtownbar.com\/\">Old Town Bar<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Pete's opened in 1864 as the Portman Hotel in a building that dates to 1829. Establishments that served alcohol have been on the premises since 1852. The famous bar has been part of the set of countless movies and TV shows including \"Ragtime\", \"Endless Love\", \"Law &amp; Order\" and \"Sex and the City\", as well as several beer commercials, including many of the famous Miller Lite commercials of the 1970s and '80s.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/2\/600_431822418.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe bar became known as Healy's in 1899 when it was bought by Tom and John Healy. The great American writer O. Henry was a regular around this time and wrote his 1906 Christmas short story \"The Gift of the Magi\" in Booth 3 at Healy's. Ludwig Bemelmans wrote \"Madeline\" here as well. The opening lines of the book were originally written on the back of a Healy's menu.<\/p> <p>Pete Belles acquired the bar from the Healys in the early 1920s and it's been known as Pete's Tavern ever since despite several ownership changes. Pete's stayed open during Prohibition by operating a flower shop in the front of the bar while the saloon continued in the back. Joe Kennedy provided the bootlegged alcohol. Years after Prohibition ended, Kennedy's son Jack and daughter-in-law Jacqueline became regulars.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll cap off our Winter Gramercy Park Old New York bar tour at the Old Town Bar. Like Pete's, the Old Town is one of those quintessential New York bars that's starred in movies and TV shows of its own including \"The Devil's Own\", and \"The Last Days of Disco.\" It was also featured in the opening of the original \"Late Night with David Letterman\" TV show and was the setting for Riff's Bar in the TV show \"Mad About You.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/0\/600_431822592.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Old Town opened in 1892 as a German restaurant called Viemaster's, which had a men-only bar downstairs and a family dining room upstairs. After surviving Prohibition as a restaurant that secretly served alcohol (if there was a raid, customers would stash booze under the seats in the booths, which still open up to this day), the bar took on its current moniker in 1933. The Old Town remains largely unchanged from its late 19th-century days, with original tile floor, frosted glass doors and mahogany bar. Like Pete's, it has a literary tradition of its own. Contemporary writers like Frank McCourt, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Kelly and Jim Dwyer have been regulars here over the years. The bar has an irreverent sense of humor about itself. In 2010, it celebrated the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oldtownbar.com\/100Years.html\">100th anniversary of the massive Hinsdale urinals<\/a> in its men's room.<\/p> <p>Should be a fun day, hopefully monsoon rains don't wash it out. A little snow wouldn't be a bad thing though.<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Old-New-York-Bars\/events\/228100103\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Winter in Gramercy Park: Molly's, Rolf's, Pete's and Old Town","id":"228100103","time":1454182200000,"updated":1454255776000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1227316715000,"name":"Old New York Bars","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1325945,"urlname":"Old-New-York-Bars","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"2 Havemeyer St","name":"Muchmore's","lon":-73.95298,"id":18865492,"state":"NY","lat":40.716549,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":3.0225071907,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1387062471000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for an afternoon of figure drawing!

Her hysterectomy surgery is tomorrow, Jan 12th, and I am staying here for another week or so to help out with her recovery. So, Im not baack in NY yet and wont be back in time for this meetup date. WHen I scheduled it, I didnt know I would be out of NY for so long, but that is what has happened. Its been a hard month. I hope that most of you can join us on the new date.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join us for delicious food, drinks, and great company with others who \"get it\". We are taking an extended break over the holidays, because I will be out of town for about 3 weeks in Massachusetts with my parents, so this will be our next gathering, and our first one of the New Year. Hope you will join us for the first hang out of 2016!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Widows-and-Widowers-Soaring-Spirits-Group-Meetup\/events\/227449493\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Italian Feast Lunch Chat !","id":"227449493","time":1454184000000,"updated":1454205208000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409961631000,"name":"NYC-Area Widows and Widowers Soaring Spirits Group Meetup","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":16821042,"urlname":"New-York-Widows-and-Widowers-Soaring-Spirits-Group-Meetup","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"312 5th Ave, (Between 31st & 32nd St.), 5th Floor","name":"NY dokseosil studio","lon":0,"id":18443172,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453070598000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Saturday, join us as we have tea time and be professionally social with others.

As many of you remember back in 2011 the Robot Wars began and our now almighty rulers took mercy on us and allowed us to live and will continue to allow us to live so long as we pay homage every year with our Robot themed NAVA. So this NAVA we will be playing games that feature our glorious leaders such as Berzerk, Tech Romancer, and Robotron 2084.<\/p> <p>Arcade challenge! During the Robot Wars where we foolishly fought against our most merciful leaders we played games like Robotron 2084 and Berzerk. To celebrate our illustrious rulers we will prove our inferiority by playing the sequel to Berzerk as our arcade challenge; Frenzy. Frenzy is a lot like Berzerk except with more robots, destructible walls and walls that you can bounce your lasers off of. Be the best at the game on this one day by logging the highest score on our arcade cabinet by 9pm and win a nifty $20 gift certificate and possibly get your name added to the \"House Champion\" tournament plaque on the Wall of Fame just above the arcade section of the store. Arcade challenge games are set to FREE PLAY all day, but please remember to let everyone get a shot. If you get the high score, move on, and no hogging the cabinet! Also if you have won last month\u2019s NAVA arcade challenge you are no eligible to win this month\u2019s challenge.<\/p> <p>Tournament! To honor the might and power of our magnificent masters we will play Cyborg Justice as our NAVA tournament. Cyborg Justice is a fighting game where instead of a character selection screen you have a robot customization screen. You pick between a body, legs and arms. For example some of your choices for arms include flame throwers, bazookas, &amp; buzz saws. Sign-ups begin at 3pm, the tournament starts around 6pm and its first-come, first-served in this FREE-to-join tournament.<\/p> <p>Starting this NAVA we will also be instituting a new rule about trade boxes. In the past few years more and more people have been brining trade boxes and the amount of space people take up is growing as well. From now on trade boxes cannot take up more than 5 square feet. To clarify 5 square feet is an area that is 5 feet by 1 foot, or 2 and a half feet by 2 feet. From now on all trade boxes must be contained to that much space. We will make exceptions for those who bring art or homebrews. If you bring something you made yourself we will not prevent you from putting out both that and an appropriately sized trade box. We will also make exceptions if you have items that themselves are large, like boxed systems or special editions to certain games. If you brought a CIB Steel Battalion we\u2019re not going to make you pack up half of your other items in your trade box. We will ask you to pack up some things if you bring a lot of large items. We cannot have such large trade boxes anymore because it\u2019s a fire hazard.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember to get your trade boxes in order so we can all buy, sell and trade together. Wear your NAVA or Digital Press t-shirt for the maximum discount on store purchases. Also, bring your Nintendo 3DS to share street passes... it's NAVA time!<\/p> <p>RSVP (optional):\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events<\/a><\/a><br\/>When: Saturday, January 30th, 3pm to midnight.<br\/>Where: Digital Press Videogames:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr<\/a><\/a><br\/>What happens: Gaming, trading, tournaments, big prizes!

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm.

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs.

Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/227938005\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"pckzryvcbnc","time":1454193000000,"updated":1454292189000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"1119 Newkirk Ave","name":"Milk & Honey","lon":-73.966499,"id":17561102,"state":"NY","lat":40.63406,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.12140369415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446847773000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join other writers for an hour of focused writing!<\/p> <p>5:30 - Start.

The Facilitator\u2019s job is to guide you into those skills gently and easily, in a fun, safe and light hearted way.

You have plenty of time to relax, chat, share a back rub or other welcome touch, cuddle, have a snack or just hang out.<\/p> <p>You can come to a Cuddle Party to meet new people, to enjoy amazing conversations, to touch, to be touched, to have fun, to practice asking for what you want, to practice saying \u201cno\u201d to what you don\u2019t want \u2014 all in a setting structured to be a safe place for exploration and enjoyment.

Due to their rules only TEN tripods will be allowed to be extended at the same time. I am inviting 15 people in the hope that you'll find ways to double up as needed or balance on one of the many horizontal surfaces. , I recommend that everyone bring a tripod at any rate, as people will not use theirs or leave earlier than you or whatever. \u00a0No guests on this one, they'll have to sign up.<\/p> <p>Due to concerns about people signing up and not showing up, this meetup is going to have a $5 charge. Due to my wish to keep this meetup free and about growing the night photography community, when you do show up I'll issue refunds to anyone who attends. Refunds will also be issued if this is cancelled or if you cancel more than three days in advance.<\/p> <p>A few additional rules: We are not allowed on staircases, landings, balconies, anywhere past train gates or tenant spaces (including Vanderbilt Hall). Photos need to be used for personal use only, no commercial use. Be polite and know this is a major transportation hub, for example, don't set up your gear in front of a window selling tickets.<\/p> <p>Please do not show up to this meetup if you do not make the list. GCT is an amazing place to shoot and I want everyone to have the opportunity, but we are hampered by their rules and we must abide. Rest assured, this will not be the only time we go to Grand Central, there will be other opportunities.<\/p> <p>I'll see people when I hand out tripod permits and then issue refunds to those that are there (even if you're late you'll still have to see me for a permit sticker).

Please read below for more information:<\/p> <p><b>Synopsis<\/b>: The No Child Left Behind Act was created to boost academic levels of American students by setting standardized goals across the nation - and holding states, districts and schools accountable for performance. For urban schools in high-poverty areas, reaching these goals is a daunting task, and many now face the possibility of being taken over by the state - even being shut down. At Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, MD, the expectations raised by NCLB have reached a critical point. Academy Award winning filmmakers Alan and Susan Raymond (I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School) offer a yearlong look inside a storied institution at a time when its very existence is in doubt. From cautionary profiles to triumphant tales, Hard Times at Douglass High serves as a reminder that education is inevitably an achievement of people, not policy.<\/p> <p><b>More information<\/b>:<\/p> <p>This event was brought to you by Samuel Simpson who will be providing the DVD for viewership at my place.\u00a0 If you would like buy it yourself before the event: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hard-Times-Douglass-High-Behind\/dp\/B001AY6QJY\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hard-Times-Douglass-High-Behind\/dp\/B001AY6QJY\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hard-Times-Douglass-High-Behind\/dp\/B001AY6QJY<\/a><\/a>.

You need a good sleeping bag rated to 10 degrees F or lower. In addition to a sleeping bag, you need a very good sleeping pad. It is important to have insulation between you and the ground. The filling in your sleeping bag that is underneath you will be compressed and provide no insulation. I highly recommend a sleeping pad with an R value of at least 5. (Hint: most closed cell foam pads have a 2.5 R value. If you double them up you will have a combined R value of<\/p> <p>5.)<\/p> <p>You will also need something to keep the snow and wind off of you while you sleep. Since we're below the tree line, any small 3 season tent should do. You want something with good ventilation so that you don't get soaked in condensation over night. Avoid a big \"princess\" tent; these don't stand up well with a snow load.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/2\/1\/600_446012545.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/2\/600_446012578.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/d\/600_446012589.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hvhikers\/events\/228167409\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Winter Camping in the Catskills","id":"228167409","time":1454198400000,"updated":1454337473000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1229395389000,"name":"Hudson Valley Hikers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1338658,"urlname":"hvhikers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"HV Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452909882000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There was not enough interest at this time so I am canceling.

Byob is allowed.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>National Headliner: Joseph Anthony<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NBC's Last Comic Standing, Atlantic City Borgata Comedy Club<\/b><\/p> <p>Joseph\u2019s father was an Italian Immigrant, who entered the United States just after WWII and began his career as a Longshoreman at the age of 17. He quickly climbed up the management ladder. His mother was born in Brooklyn, NY and raised Joseph on: delicious dishes, overbearing love, inherent O.C.D. \u2026 And incidentally, had a mean right hook - for someone who stood only 4\u2019 11!\u201d<\/p> <p>Surprisingly, being raised (in part) by his five older sisters who frequently opened Joseph\u2019s mind up to such things as: how to use a hot curling hair kit, cleaning the crevices of wood furniture, and being a constant (mini) Hustle practice partner, all with the absence of any brothers and a father determined to figure out the fine art of betting, he (Joseph) was no stranger to the ways of the streets, but also enjoyed a quiet retreat to read and write at a very young age. The results you say? He can hold court with both Harvard and Sing Sing prison alumni, just the same. Yet despite his upbringing, he belongs to no one particular group, class, click, or innate stereotypes, as it were. In the world of entertainment, he\u2019s simply referred to quite often as: VERSATILE \u2013 TALENTED \u2013 FUNNY - SMART!<\/p> <p>Joseph studied writing style and screen writing at the New School for Social Research, in New York City. He learned the basics of filmmaking at the College of Staten Island, NY. He studied the Meisner technique of acting under Joanna Beckson (Ray Romano\u2019s teacher), herself a student of the famed Actors Studio.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Feature: Sharon Simon<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Saturday Night Live<\/b><\/p> <p>Edgy, electifying and a bit sassy, comedian Sharon Simon personifies \"Jewish Trash\".<br\/>Growing up as the only Jewish child in an Hispanic neighborhood, her blonde hair and lack of pigment quickly earned her the sobriquet, \"Flashlight\".<\/p> <p>YESTERDAY<br\/>If you watched Saturday Night Live in the 80s, and didn't blink, you MIGHT have seen a very young Sharon in a Christmas sketch. Apparently this small scene paid a lot as Sharon didn't find it necessary to appear on TV again for quite some time<\/p> <p>While most Jewish girls use daddy's money to attend spendy colleges, Sharon stripped to pay her way through Rutgers University's drama program. Sharon briefly dated the one straight man in her acting program but alas, he too turned out to be gay.<br\/>Sharon later went on to become an EMT<\/p> <p>TODAY<br\/>Sharon's edgy act and unique, \"Jewish Trash\" style is burning up clubs and colleges all over the U.S. and Canada. You can catch Sharon on Sirius Radio and as an opening act for Jim Norton, (she once used her EMT training to save a woman that collapsed during a Norton show).<\/p> <p>TONIGHT<br\/>If Sharon isn't home in one of New York City's top clubs she is pounding an audience on the road with her refreshingly unique comedy, (that means, among other things, Sharon doesn't get on stage to complain about men and PMS).<\/p> <p>Also performing..

Dance is joyful and powerful, and it's definitely made all the richer when practiced in a group, where we reflect one another's beauty and hold space for each other's pain. To witness each other and to be seen, so that we can move through the world as our most authentic selves. It's a lot of fun, and also really cathartic, as we feel into our bodies and touch into the deepest parts of ourselves...igniting bliss and releasing any blocks we might be holding. This soulful dance party will draw from various traditions that can help fuel an awesome reconnection with body and soul, including 5Rhythms, Authentic Movement, Ancient Temple Arts, Qigong, and Meditation.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/brooklynyogacollective.com\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Ecstatic-Dance\/events\/227996073\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Dance!","id":"czqknlyvcbnc","time":1454202000000,"updated":1454214385000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451927398000,"name":"Brooklyn Ecstatic Dance Night","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19276513,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Ecstatic-Dance","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"87 Ludlow St","name":"Leftfield NYC","lon":-73.989304,"id":24053649,"lat":40.718239,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.19944810867,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454007798000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you love Music and hate being bored especially on a Saturday night....no worries we got you !<\/p> <p>WHAT - \"The Venom Concert\" with performances by Bruse Wane and other artist and guest appearences.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/228157594\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvcbpc","time":1454248800000,"updated":1454260560000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450466843000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i>\u00a0(MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

He is based in NYC but his work takes him around the globe. He first picked up a camera while spending a year traveling through Europe after having earned his MBA early. Like many travelers, that passion for seeing and experiencing the world is precisely what ignited the spark for photography. Clifford has since spent all of his time learning how to see and capture the world with what he refers to as \"a new mind\". He hasn't been shooting for 40 years, he hasn't been alive for 40 years. He hasn't been classically trained in the fine arts either. He is entirely self-taught, which has formed within him his greatest asset: the ability to relate to the amateur photographer. Leveraging both the business and photography skills he has developed and maintained for over a decade, he is the owner of several successful photographic enterprises and a corporate commercial video production company working with clients such as Google, Apple, Adidas, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Sephora and Clinique. His work has been featured in National Geographic, the smithsonian, and many other publications. \u00a0To see some of Cliff\u2019s work, you may visit his website at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cliffordpickett.com\">www.cliffordpickett.com<\/a>.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/mgZzRmmrYsyMOSWbWeJ2IffcPwT3jivMpEF-Ywmeqola7Fkug7MZiSiNoioc9fyVgYy2EVWPFSPG_PaiENBLtpV3otCrkimLJtprBLOeInk_p-1yKz5nI4RKF0Sk9kfsK267_5LF\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/mgZzRmmrYsyMOSWbWeJ2IffcPwT3jivMpEF-Ywmeqola7Fkug7MZiSiNoioc9fyVgYy2EVWPFSPG_PaiENBLtpV3otCrkimLJtprBLOeInk_p-1yKz5nI4RKF0Sk9kfsK267_5LF<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCDPW\/events\/227677387\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":25200000,"name":"Adobe Lightroom Boot Camp 2016 - Day Two","id":"227677387","time":1454256000000,"updated":1454282418000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1311162680000,"name":"NYC Digital Photography Workshops","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":2203141,"urlname":"NYCDPW","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"375 W 37th St","name":"Ramini Espresso Bar","lon":-73.99455,"id":24292460,"lat":40.755173,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.430190891027,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452110270000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It looks like that everyone will be snowed in for the weekend.

But oppression and bigotry also require seeing some as \u201csame\u201d and some as \u201cother.\u201d Ethical Culture proposes that no one is really the same, everyone is unique. What would our world look like if we included more and more as \u201cUs\u201d and \u201csame\u201d \u2014 or all just as unique and individual \u2014 and fewer as \u201cother\u201d?

Change has already started on paramount levels, with the universe asking all of us to surrender in ways we would have never imagined. I look at this new alignment as so transformative, yet my heart is with all those who feel alone or at a loss as to how to effectively transition with less struggle and more peace. I am back at the Oaks again in a few weeks as space was available, facilitating a workshop along with my colleague Anton. We are offering this once again on a suggested donation basis. No one will be turned away for lack of funds. It was a great turn out last time. RSVP is required. There were many that showed up last minute and we would appreciate knowing ahead of time who will join us. The spirits have a lot to share as always. I promise our time together will be transformational!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>I look forward to seeing you..and please feel free to pass along this announcement to anyone you feel might benefit from the group.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>God Bless and keep you safe,<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Laura<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Healing Beyond Boundaries: With Messages from the Spirit World<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<i>In this experiential workshop, come and explore the possibilities that might just lead you to your authentic self. Spiritual, emotional, physical patterning and trauma, lead many of us to question our purpose and perceived realities in everyday living. This constant questioning may also lead to soul loss. Most of the time we can only see things from a place of fear and uncertainty , not how they actually are, or how they might be if we hold them in a space of sacredness. Retrieving soul pieces takes great patience, courage and a certain amount of acceptance.\u00a0 It also takes great honesty to stare into the mirror and come to the realization of the difference between who you think you are and who you\u00a0really\u00a0are.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The first thing you will learn is that you are not alone. Everyone participates at various levels. Through connecting with the spirit world. group process work, and various healing tools we'll start a journey together and see what unfolds. Since this is an experiential workshop, be open to healing things happening!<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The workshop will be 3 hours long. 1\/2 hour will be used for group\u00a0\u00a0Chi-gong healing exercises and another 1\/2 hour for a break to eat lunch or interact and share. This is about you and your time. Bring whatever you need to make yourself comfortable. Water, snacks or lunch to eat on the break etc...<\/i><\/p> <p><i>THIS WORKSHOP HAS A SUGGESTED DONATION OF $20 TO BENEFIT THE SPACE THAT IS OFFERED TO US BY THE NEW DAWN FOUNDATION.

Model Photoshoot Society Presents:<\/p> <p><b>\"Model Spotlight: Glamour &amp; Implied Shoot w\/Marlene - Jan.31st\"<\/b><\/p> <p><b>(Rescheduled Snow Date)<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0With the success of our last Model Spotlight, we decided to setup another Spotlight shoot this month with returning beauty Marlene. She was such a big hit last time and we're happy to have her back at the studio for this glamour and pre-valentine shoot.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>There will be three looks with a possibly 4th pending time. (We squeezed in a 4th setup on our last shoot.) First we will shoot Marlene in swimwear in one of our backdrops for a pinup style. Second look will be lingerie using our LED lighting which proved very popular at our last shoot. Third, will be an implied look with a \"bed of roses\", pre-valentine look.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>NEW:\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox as that adds the surcharge automatically. If we have to return a deposit for any reason, it will be less than originally deposited.)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Balance due at time of shoot:\u00a0$60<\/b>, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.<\/p> <p>Non-Commercial Release PDF will be emailed to you at the email address given on the sign in sheet.<\/p> <p><b>Model:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Marlene (Marly Mar) :\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marlenemndz\/\">Instagram<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BellaPesadilla\">Facebook<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Photos provided by model for promotional purposes only.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/227625926\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Glamour & Implied Shoot w\/Marlene - Jan. 31st","id":"227625926","time":1454259600000,"updated":1454286611000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1386510076000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ALWAYS CHECK THE MTA SUBWAY SERVICE CHANGES!!! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mta.info\/weekender.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mta.info\/weekender.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mta.info\/weekender.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>This is an opportunity for you to get your jam on!<\/p> <p>This meetup focuses on giving members opportunities to solo, play off each other, experiment with different percussion sounds, and rhythm games.<\/p> <p>I bring a few drums and percussion instruments, but I advise you to bring your own if have.

Young men across the former USSR face violence at home and in the military.

First of all, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is James Shen. I volunteered to be the new organizer for the Northern NJ Writers meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Secondly, I want to thank the previous organizer, Candace E. Barnes and assistant organizer, John Adamus for their dedication for the past 13 years. Because of their work, NNJW has a fan base of 407 members. This is amazing for such a small writers' group. It would be a shame for all this to end, if nobody steps up to be the new organizer, so I volunteered.<\/p> <p>\n\nNext, I want to tell you a little about myself. I am relatively new to meetups. I went to my first meetup last November. I've been searching for the \"perfect meetup\" ever since. I've tried so many different types of meetups. There are social meetups that range from speed dating, to professional networking. I've tried them all. I still haven't found one that I really love.<br\/>I discovered my passion for writing a few months ago, about the same time that I started going to meetups. So I said to myself, why not go to a writers' meetup, since that's your passion in life? Why not surround yourself with others who share the same passion? Therefore, I started searching for a writers meetup. But I have encountered a few problems.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>1. Show up and write<br\/>There are some writing meetups that you show up and you write. I think that's pretty dumb because I can write at home, why would I travel to a meetup to write?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>2.No regular location<br\/>There are other meetups that take place in people's private homes because they don't have a regular location. This gets pretty confusing because I'll be going to a new house at every meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>3.Limit to 2 pages, single spaced<br\/>There are some meetups that limit the work that we can bring to 2 pages or 1,000 words. This is pointless because my shortest work is 4-5 pages or 2,000 words.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>4.Non-critiquing<br\/>Many other writers\u2019 meetups are non-critiquing. So what's the point of going to a writer's meetup if you can't get any feedback?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>5.Monthly meetups<br\/>The problem with monthly meetups is that, some of us who bring a long piece of work in smaller parts. By the time you read the second part, you already forgot about the first part, because it's been a month already.<br\/>Therefore, my meetup will be a weekly, constructive critiquing meetup at a regular location, with a maximum limit of 2,500 words or 5 pages. We write all our works at home.<br\/>In case you haven't notice, I've already made a few changes in our meetup rules.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Rule 1. MEETUP FREQUENCY<br\/>Change from MONTHLY to WEEKLY meetup\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Rule 2. VOLUME LIMIT ON WORK<br\/>Change from 1-4 pages DOUBLE SPACED work (or 500-1,000 words) to 2-5 pages of SINGLE SPACED work (1,000 to 2,500 words)\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Rule 3. DAY AND TIME OF MEETUP<br\/>Change from Monday night at 7pm to Sunday 1 pm. This is because I have a medical condition that make it very difficult for me to drive at night. Since most people work 9 to 5, Mon to Fri, and Saturday is the worst traffic congested day of the week. Sunday is the only option left.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Rule 4. MEETUP LOCATION<br\/>Obviously now that the day and time has changed, the location has to be changed also, because the Paramus Barnes &amp; Noble is closed on Sunday. Most stores in Bergen county are closed on Sunday. Therefore, I have to think outside of Bergen county. The next best choice is Wayne, NJ. And I chose the Wayne Burger King.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Rule 5. MANDATORY INTRODUCTORY MEETUP FOR ALL MEMBERS, JAN 31ST, Sun, 1 PM at Wayne Burger King.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nRule 6. ATTENDANCE MATTERS\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For those members who do not attend the Intro meetup, will be removed from the group. Those members who miss two or more meetups in a row will also be removed. I apologize, but our space is very limited. We don't need all 407 members. I only need the few loyal members who will attend the meetups regularly and contribute.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Rules 7. RSVP<br\/>RSVP end 9 am, Sunday morning.<\/p> <p><br\/>Rules 8. MULTI-GROUP EVENT<br\/>There will be a few new members joining us from my previous writers' group - North Jersey Aspiriting Writers Group (NJAW). (It is a brand new meetup that I created, just a week ago). We have 29 members already as I am writing this letter. There will be a merge happening with these two groups. This is so exciting! I can't wait to meet every one.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Rule 9. Respect<br\/>Be respectful to other writer's work. No discrimination, making fun,or any offensive remarks are tolerated. The offender will be given one warning only and then asked to leave. He or she will be permanently removed from the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Rule 10 Privacy<br\/>Respect our privacy. Some of us may write fictions. Other may write our memoirs or autobiographies. These are personal stories that should stay in the group. No gossiping is permitted. Otherwise, the offender will be removed from the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>How do I run the writers meetup:<\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet at the Burger King.\u00a0 I will wait for people to show up between 12:40-1:10 pm.\u00a0 The manager will save us a corner.\u00a0 I will have two signs on the tables that say \"North Jersey Aspiring Writers Meetup\".\u00a0 We will take turns read our writings out loud.\u00a0 I will hand out color pens.\u00a0 The listeners will critique the writings verbally and in writing.\u00a0 Be tactful, please.\u00a0 Be sure to write your name on the top of the first page of the person's work, so we know who made the comments.\u00a0 By at the end of the meetup, all copies of the work should be returned to the writer.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nComplaints:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>I know I will get some complaints from the older members who have to drive an extra 15 miles to get to Wayne. But guess what? I live in Fort Lee, NJ. I have to drive 24 miles to Wayne, NJ. I like to lead by example. I don't want to hear anybody whine and complain for driving less than I do:)<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJan 28, 2016 update - Adding an Icebreaker game<\/p> <p>Icebreaking game:<\/p> <p>Great news, folks.\u00a0 A good member has suggested to make my first meetup MORE INTERESTING.\u00a0 Great idea!\u00a0 Therefore, I came up with an ICEBREAKING GAME.\u00a0 It is a great game where we ask ourselves meaningful, thoughtful questions, and get to know each other.\u00a0 You may even discover things you didn't know about yourself.<\/p> <p>Sample questions would be:<\/p> <p>1.What are your passions in life? How did you discover them?<\/p> <p>2. Describe a negative experience which you turned into a positive one.<\/p> <p>3. Would have a billion dollars change you? your friends? your relationship? your passion? your purpose in life?<\/p> <p>4. What would be your bucket list?<\/p> <p>5.

You can bring your work, we will go over it if time permits.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>My background:<\/p> <p>I am relatively new to meetups. I went to my first meetup last November. I've been searching for the \"perfect meetup\" ever since. I've tried so many different types of meetups. There are social meetups that range from speed dating, to professional networking. I've tried them all. I still haven't found one that I really love.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>I discovered my passion for writing a few months ago, about the same time that I started going to meetups. So I said to myself, why not go to a writers' meetup, since that's your passion in life? Why not surround yourself with others who share the same passion? Therefore, I started searching for a writers meetup. But I have encountered a few problems.\u00a0<\/p> <p>1. Show up and write\u00a0<br\/>There are some writing meetups that you show up and you write. I think that's pretty dumb because I can write at home, why would I travel to a meetup to write?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>2.No regular location\u00a0<br\/>There are other meetups that take place in people's private homes because they don't have a regular location.

It is sad, but true. \u00a0 So I changed my meetup name to \"North Jersey Aspiring Writers meetup\" include the entire northern Jersey. \u00a0I originally planned to meet on Saturday. \u00a0But I soon realized that it was another mistake. \u00a0Saturdays are the most traffic congested day of the week. \u00a0Sundays are much better. \u00a0I apologize for the confusion.<\/p> <p>My email: [masked],<\/p> <p><br\/>My cell phone:[masked]<\/p> <p>I look forward to see you there. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJan 12, merger announcement update:<\/p> <p>Dear NJAW members:<\/p> <p>Great news! \u00a0I've had a rare opportunity today to take over as the new organizer for a much older writers meetup group called \"North NJ Writers group\". \u00a0It is another small, selective writers group with RSVP of 10 people. \u00a0But they have 400 members. \u00a0They started in 2003. \u00a0They've existed for 13 years. \u00a0Their regular meetup time was once a month, on a Monday evening at 7 pm. \u00a0Their regular location was the Barnes Noble store at Paramus. \u00a0But since I have a medical condition that make it very difficult for me to drive at night, I have to set the meetup during the day. \u00a0Most people work 9 to 5 on Mon to Fri. \u00a0Saturdays are the most traffic congested day of the week. \u00a0Therefore, I chose Sunday. \u00a0But here's another thing, Barnes Noble at Paramus is closed on Sundays and so does most other stores in Bergen county. \u00a0Therefore, I have to think outside of Bergen county. \u00a0Wayne seems to be the next best location. \u00a0<\/p> <p>I chose the Wayne Burger King. \u00a0If everything goes well, our two meetup groups will merge into one. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>JAN 28, 2016 Icebreaker game UPDATE:<\/p> <p>Great news, folks.\u00a0 A good member has suggested to make my first meetup MORE INTERESTING.\u00a0 Great idea!\u00a0 Therefore, I came up with an ICEBREAKING GAME.\u00a0 It is a great game where we ask ourselves meaningful, thoughtful questions, and get to know each other.\u00a0 You may even discover things you didn't know about yourself.<\/p> <p>Sample questions would be:<\/p> <p>1.What are your passions in life?

With so many different architectural styles, these Victorian houses in Prospect Park South are whimsically placed next to each other.

He selects a region, does a little write-up, and identifies three wines to try. After drinking the wines, people go to the newspaper's on-line comments section to have a conversation about what they've learned and liked. I've had fun doing this for several months, but thought it might be even better with some of you.

Please make every effort to find the specific bottles listed by Asimov. Be sure to post a comment with which wine you will be bringing so that we can have a variety of bottles. Some bottle duplication will be inevitable, but we do want some variety.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Because wine needs food, each participant should also bring something tasty to eat and share.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b>\u00a0 The cost of the Asimov Wine School meetups will vary depending on the cost of that month's wine. \u00a0Generally it's been somewhere between $15-$70 for the bottle you bring plus the cost of whatever snack you select to share.<\/p> <p><b>January's details<\/b>: \u00a0We'll be drinking from <i>Marsannay Burgundy <\/i>this month.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/06\/dining\/wine-school-assignment-marsannay-burgundy.html?_r=0\">Read Eric Asimov's January Wine School article here: <\/a>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCwinetastingschool\/events\/227900279\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Marsannay Burgundy tasting","id":"227900279","time":1454266800000,"updated":1454287682000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1190320947000,"name":"Wine Tasting \"School\" of New York and more!","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":697965,"urlname":"NYCwinetastingschool","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Wine Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(917) 609-9144","address_1":"Lexington Ave and 53 Street","name":"Citigroup Center's Atrium","lon":-73.97098,"id":289538,"state":"NY","lat":40.758366,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":1.15319371223,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452004930000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Happy New Year!\u00a0 For our first meetup of 2016, our number one book from the poll is:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/6\/2\/600_445665666.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>From Amazon:\u00a0 \"An unmissable milestone for fans of Sir Terry Pratchett: the first SF novel in over three decades in which the visionary inventor of Discworld has created a new universe of tantalizing possibilities\u2014a series of parallel \u201cEarths\u201d with doorways leading to adventure, intrigue, excitement, and an escape into the furthest reaches of the imagination.\"<\/p> <p>From book jacket:\u00a0 \"The possibilities are endless.

Same three themes and same amount of shooting time as first shoot, just shorter overall timeframe for an even smaller group.)<\/i><\/p> <p>With the success of our last Model Spotlight, we decided to setup another Spotlight shoot this month with returning beauty Marlene. She was such a big hit last time and we're happy to have her back at the studio for this glamour and pre-valentine shoot.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>First we will shoot Marlene in swimwear in one of our backdrops for a pinup style. Second look will be lingerie using our LED lighting which proved very popular at our last shoot. Third, will be an implied look with a \"bed of roses\", pre-valentine look.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>NEW:\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$70<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox as that adds the surcharge automatically. If we have to return a deposit for any reason, it will be less than originally deposited.)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Balance due at time of shoot:\u00a0$50<\/b>, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.<\/p> <p>Non-Commercial Release PDF will be emailed to you at the email address given on the sign in sheet.<\/p> <p><b>Model:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Marlene (Marly Mar) :\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marlenemndz\/\">Instagram<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BellaPesadilla\">Facebook<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Photos provided by model for promotional purposes only.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/227973948\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Glamour & Implied Shoot w\/Marlene #2 - Jan. 31st","id":"227973948","time":1454274000000,"updated":1454339177000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07302","country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"9 Regent Street","name":"Brewshot","lon":-74.046196,"id":9740222,"state":"NJ","lat":40.715061,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.8137421608,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445775932000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0Bring a writing utensil, laptop or note pad for writing prompts.\u00a0 Let's get our creative juices flowing; write, share and laugh.\u00a0 All writers, all genres welcome. \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Jersey-City-Writers-Meetup-Group\/events\/227944375\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Write On with Gabby","id":"vjksllyvcbpc","time":1454274000000,"updated":1454282586000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249927320000,"name":"Jersey City Writers","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":1504099,"urlname":"The-Jersey-City-Writers-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Writers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11105","country":"us","city":"Astoria","phone":"718-777-9477","address_1":"29-17 23rd Avenue","name":"Ornella Trattoria","lon":-73.913128,"id":1339985,"state":"NY","lat":40.774891,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.38375902176,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452225092000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I've never been to this place, but I've heard good things about it.\u00a0 Here is the link to their website:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/ornellatrattoria.com\/index.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ornellatrattoria.com\/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/ornellatrattoria.com\/index.html<\/a><\/a>.\u00a0 Let's have an early Sunday dinner and some chill time.<\/p> <p>The Pre-Fixe menu will include: Appetizer (Prosciutto and Cheese), Entree (Fasuli e Ragu, different types of meats, e.g., beef, pork, short ribs, meatballs, with pasta), and Coffee\/Dessert (Tiramisu or Cheesecake), for $35 plus tax and tip.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We can meet inside the restaurant...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/marriagemindedchristiansinglesNYC\/events\/227931775\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Sunday Early Dinner","id":"227931775","time":1454274000000,"updated":1454285673000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1387821243000,"name":"Marriage-Minded Christian Singles NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":11548092,"urlname":"marriagemindedchristiansinglesNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"277 Canal St. 3rd Floor","name":"UFC Gym","lon":-74.00145,"id":23574672,"state":"NY","lat":40.719151,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.21892952919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424483918000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come for an afternoon of co-ed boxing.

Off-stage certain things were seen as too much vs. on-stage they were admired.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The #1 reason I first decided to create <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Living-Quirky-in-NYC\/events\/227922454\/\">The Quirk Thing: A Stage for the Unconventional<\/a> was to offer this same safe place to express.<\/p> <p>I'd also love to offer some extra support off-stage in the form of a <b>Quirkshop<\/b>! <i>An experiential workshop for discovering and exploring your QuirkPowers!<\/i><\/p> <p>On special occasions, I've been teaching singing.

While learning Jeremy\u2019s six point ACCESS method, you will have the opportunity to practice the ACCESS method by directing actors in short movie scene rehearsals during each class.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Jeremy will coach you through these rehearsals to help guide you to your vision. You will have the opportunity to observe your fellow directors working with the same scene and actors during each class in order to witness how much a director\u2019s input can radically change any scene for better or worse. And by the final class, you will select a movie scene of your choice and direct that scene rehearsal in class to implement what you have learned.<\/p> <p>\"Directors ACCESS\u00a0Workshop\" is a fun and safe place to explore your craft of directing the actor while expanding your director\u2019s tool box and skill set. When a scene is not working, directors often make a misdiagnosis of where the problem emanates. This workshop is a great opportunity to discover how to correct that common mistake by learning all six points of Jeremy\u2019s ACCESS method. During the workshop you\u2019ll learn to diagnose a performance problem accurately, so the correct method of adjustment can be implemented.

Since Calatayud achieved DO status in 1990, modern, independent winemakers have been attracted to the region, but there\u2019s a consistently highly rated Calatayud Garnacha made by a cooperative\u2014the widely distributed, value-priced Las Rocas.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying the premium bottling by Bodegas Ateca, an old-vines Garnacha that spent 18 months in French oak.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Somontano: <\/i>\u00a0Arag\u00f3n\u2019s most dynamic and varied wine region.\u00a0 The name means \u201cunder the mountain,\u201d appropriate for this region that sits in the Pyrenees foothills.\u00a0 Unlike Campo de Borja or Calatayud, Somontano <i>looks<\/i> like a flourishing wine region, with ample rainfall and rolling green hills.\u00a0 After the Somontano DO was established in 1984, international varieties became the appellation\u2019s calling card, but competing with better established Cabernets and Syrahs in the marketplace proved difficult.\u00a0 The modern Vi\u00f1as del Vero winery sets the standard for the region, especially with its single-estate Secastilla Garnacha, which we will be trying in the 2010 vintage.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be returning to Piccola Trattoria in Dobbs Ferry for an early Sunday dinner.\u00a0 They did a great job of hosting our Argentina event.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/piccolany.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/piccolany.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/piccolany.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2014 Vi\u00f1a Zorzal Garnacha Rosado (Navarra)\u00a0 $10<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not reviewed.\u00a0 From Chambers Street Wines:<\/i>\u00a0 Vi\u00f1a Zorzal offers some seriously delicious wines from old vines for very little money. This one honors the traditional wine of the\u00a0Navarra region\u2014rosado\u00a0of Garnacha\u2014and is made from the Sanz family's low-yielding, head-trained, organically farmed, old-vine\u00a0Garnacha. Fragrant red currant, raspberry, and pink peppercorn aromas lead to distinctive crushed cranberry and strawberry fruit, with zesty pink grapefruit, tropical, and herbal undertones on the finish.

Matures for 5 months in used French oak.\u00a0 Deeper crimson. Fabulously aromatic even though it is restrained\u2014the quality of the aroma more than the intensity. And just a touch of oak spice. Firm and a little chewy on the palate, the oak very well-integrated, just adding a little to the structure and depth. Has all the fragrance of Graciano but with refined structure too.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Pago de San Gabriel Zubiola (Navarra) \u00a0$21<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 91<\/i> <i>\u2013<\/i> (90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, raised in new French oak.)\u00a0Opaque ruby.\u00a0 Intense raspberry preserve and candied flowers on the nose and palate.\u00a0 Silky and seamless in texture, with red fruit and great lift and definition for a hot vintage.\u00a0 Sweet berry and floral pastille notes linger on a long, spicy, focused finish.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Domaines Lupier El Terroir (Navarra)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> <i>\u2013<\/i> The 2010 El Terroir is a barrel selection of the argilo-calcareous Garnacha vineyards, which is hitting it on all cylinders, with a floral, red and black berry aromas, as well as balsamic notes with just hints of spices and smoke. The palate is medium-bodied with ultra-fine tannins and a silky texture that makes it very pleasant and easy to drink. Drinking beautifully today, it should last quite a bit. Drink 2016-2021.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Bodegas Aragonesas Fagus de Coto de Hayas (Campo de Borja, Aragon)\u00a0 $22<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> <i>\u2013<\/i> The 2012 Fagus de Coto de Hayas is a selection of Garnacha from 40- to 50-year-old vineyards, which aged in contact with the lees in new French oak barrels for ten months. It's very aromatic and perfumed, with strong notes of flowers and ripe small red and blueberries, hints of incense and vanilla, very showy and attractive, perhaps a little over the top. The palate is medium-bodied, with glossy, sophisticated tannins and a fine texture. This is a sleek, showy wine.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Bodegas Ateca Atteca Armas (Calatayud, Aragon)\u00a0 $43<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 92<\/i> <i>\u2013<\/i> (All Garnacha; aged in French oak for 18 months.) Opaque ruby.\u00a0 Sexy, oak-spiced dark berries and incense on the nose.\u00a0 Broad and palate-coating, offering sweet black and blue fruit flavors that pick up spiciness and florality with air.\u00a0 Juicy and precise on the finish, showing impressive tenacity and supple, harmonious tannins.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Vi\u00f1as del Vero Secastilla<\/b><b>\u00a0(Somontano, Aragon)\u00a0 $45<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 15.5\/20 \u2013<\/i> Garnacha.

It\u2019s important to know that this club can be anything we want it to be, don\u2019t be fooled by the name. We have had meetups and interest in trails outside of the Watchung Mountains, road workouts, road races, track work, hikes, and both trail and non-trail events.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please use this opportunity to speak loudly and be heard! If you\u2019re an active member, send your feedback about what you enjoyed this Fall and suggestions for improvement. If you have yet to join us, tell us why! Feedback about distance, experience, terrain, pace, location, and schedules will all be appreciated. We are also actively seeking new event hosts. The commitment can be as simple as a desire to share one of your workouts with the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A huge thank you goes out to Michael and Chris for regularly posting and sharing their workouts with our members. Without these ongoing efforts we wouldn\u2019t have a group to speak of. Not only did they open their personal schedules up to all of us, but I\u2019ve seen them first hand exhibit amazing leadership abilities in sharing information about the trails or workout, answering questions, and wholeheartedly following the \u201cno man left behind\u201d mantra. We have also had a few brave souls who generously posted suggested meetups or signed up to be event hosts in the near future. Stephen has already begun sharing workouts and has posted an event for late Spring!<\/p> <p>A thank you is also in order to each and every member who attended a meetup this Fall. As we get up and running (pun intended), it took a leap of faith on each of your parts to trust in your host, the club, the meetup system, and be open and willing enough to meet new faces and share a run.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Here is to a great start and a bright future!

Although not considered as difficult a dance as the salsa. It also has it's share of difficult patterns as one progresses through the learning stages.

For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Schumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups.

Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup.
