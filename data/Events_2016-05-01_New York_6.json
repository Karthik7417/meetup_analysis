That can range from basic photo or camera help to assistance with composition and advanced techniques.<\/p> <p>Also, as an\u00a0added value, you'll be able to send me your photos (or links to them) from this workshop for evaluation and feedback.

It also is expressed in attitudes like resistance, rejection or distraction.<\/p> <p>Hatred can arise in\u00a0response to memories of past events, from any thought or event\u00a0in the present moment or even from thoughts of an imagined future event. It can arise when someone injures us or someone we love or if we just think they do. It also shows up when someone does something good for someone we already dislike or hate. On the community or global level hatred arises as racial, ethnic or gender violence, or in the extreme, it can\u00a0culminate in war and genocide.<\/p> <p>The challenge, then, is how to express compassion or kindness toward ourselves and other beings. The answer is found in understanding that we do ignore how connected to and dependent on we are to each other. By correcting the misperception of separateness and finding\u00a0wise balance in our responses\u00a0to impermanence, we can live more awakened and aware.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

Rattia\u2019s images, however, go beyond what most people typically know of men in the profession. While sometimes shooting the dancers onstage as they present themselves to their audience, Rattia more often preferred to capture portraits backstage or at home, in order to create a more fully rounded picture of these men and their lives.<\/p> <p>Rattia muses: \u201cBackstage, preparing for their performances, the dancers primp and pump and shave to look their best and meet the expectations of their lucrative patrons.\u201d However, he points out: \u201cEach of the strippers has a story, in many cases mundane and generally unexpected.

Here, Barry utilizes words to realize a site-specific installation on the walls and the floor of the Gallery. In using language, the artist invites a sense of contemplation and encourages mental fluctuation; words announce an intangible and psychic exchange. The movement between states is best conveyed by Psychic Series (1969). Almost imperceptible, this gray vinyl text work is installed in the entry of the Gallery; it announces: \u201cEverything in the unconscious perceived by the senses but not noted by the conscious mind during trips to Baltimore during the summer of 1967\u201d.<\/p> <p><br\/>7TH STOP: LUHRING AUGUSTINE GALLERY (531 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: JANET CARDIFF &amp; GEORGE BURES MILLER, THE MARIONETTE MAKER<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/a\/f\/f\/600_448903775.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Cardiff and Miller\u2019s kinetic installation\u00a0The Marionette Maker\u00a0(2014) comprises a full-scale vintage caravan that houses myriad characters in a haunting environment.

Viewers are able to walk around the camper and peer inside the puppets\u2019 domain, as well as sit in theater seats adjacent to the trailer to watch the characters perform an opera. Recordings of forests and rainstorms emanate from rotating speakers above the trailer, overlapping with music made by the robotically controlled marionettes positioned throughout the installation. The audio elements continually intermingle, further enveloping the audience into the immersive, voyeuristic environment.<\/p> <p><br\/>8TH STOP: MIKE WEISS GALLERY (520 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: MICHAEL BROWN, IN THE MEANTIME<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/f\/b\/600_448911963.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>thirty-three year old artist hand-cuts and polishes stainless steel until he has recreated a broken mirror. Brown embarked on the series in 2006 and began exhibiting the works internationally in 2007 with Yvon Lambert Gallery. The exhibition will feature eight works all in stainless steel with artist's frames and measuring 84 inches in height and 48 inches in width.<\/p> <p>Brown begins abruptly, striking the surface of actual mirrors and surveying the cracks for appealing patterns to recreate.\u00a0 Beyond this initial stage, however, the process is arduous and painstaking. For each work, Brown must cut and polish hundreds of pieces of stainless steel. Yet the imagery is still defined by immediacy \u2013 it conjures frustration and angst but also seems to capture an impulsive and gratifying moment of release, where deep-seated feelings surface and become tangible.<\/p> <p>Throughout his career, Brown has maintained a conscious and highly meticulous focus on his materials.\u00a0 \u201cStainless steel,\u201d says the artist, \u201cto me is a modern material that represents strength and efficiency\u2026.I like to think I\u2019m embarrassing the material with my own labor.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing easy about Brown\u2019s working method; he must exhaust hours on end of manual labor to achieve a result that adheres to his scrupulous standards.\u00a0 Yet his result isn\u2019t something that looks perfectly created; instead, the material appears broken \u2013 shattered to where the reflective purpose of the \u2018mirror\u2019 is moot. Looking into the heart of Brown\u2019s spiderwebbed compositions, your vision becomes fragmented and it is impossible to see yourself clearly and in unity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>9th STOP: CARA GALLERY (508 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: AGOSTINO ARRIVABENE, HIEROGAMY<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/9\/b\/600_448932187.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Investigating eternity, time, the process of change, the rites of transformation, and sacred love and death, Arrivabene utilizes symbols and images that are seemingly distant from the contemporary in order to create art that verges on the philosophical, sociological and even spiritual era.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hierogamy recalls the Alchemic myth of the Hermaphrodite, namely the being that encapsulates all, an entity that encompasses everything.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0brings together works created in varying pictorial techniques \u2013 oil on canvas or wood, cracked oil on brass, and painting on stone according to the ancient Wunderkammer tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/>10TH STOP: YOSSI MILO GALLERY [masked]TH AVE) PRESENTS: JOHN CHIARA, WEST SIDE AT TIRIONDA<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/6\/0\/600_448912320.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Instead of using film negatives, Chiara shoots directly onto color photographic paper with large-scale, hand-made cameras, the largest of which must be physically entered in order to position the photographic paper. While making an exposure, he burns, dodges and often filters the light entering through the lens as if working in the darkroom. Chiara processes these one-of-a-kind photographs in large sections of capped PVC pipes that he rolls across the studio floor. The prints retain traces of the developing process, such as streaks, drips, and unevenly saturated colors, evidence of the hands-on nature of making these pictures in an approach that is ultimately part photography and part event.<\/p> <p><br\/>11TH STOP: ANNA ZORINA GALLERY (533 W 23RD ST) PRESENTS: ALEXANDER KALETSKI, OUT OF THE BLUE<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/b\/f\/600_448912415.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>12TH STOP: PAULA COOPER GALLERY (534 W 21ST) PRESENTS: CHARLES GAINES, NUMBERS AND TREES; CENTRAL PARK SERIES<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/9\/5\/600_448912629.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Gaines creates work that often employs plotting and mathematics to organize visual components. While appearing systematic and scientific, Gaines\u2019s works ultimately refrain from producing empirical knowledge, preferring instead to invoke the viewer\u2019s subjective response. They explore an individual\u2019s perception, expression and speculative thought, as they operate both within and against a system.<\/p> <p>Charles Gaines\u2019s new work,\u00a0Numbers and Trees: Central Park Series I, marks an extension of his early interest in serialized projects. For each of his eight triptychs, Gaines divides and mounts a black and white photograph of a tree in Central Park, taken at the time of the artist\u2019s 2014 exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Enclosing each panel within an acrylic box, screened with grids of half-inch squares, he graphs the silhouette of the tree directly onto the overlaid acrylic surface. Filling cells with vibrant paint, Gaines plots numbers to index the leaves and branches of each tree; he begins at the center of the trunk, counting outward in both directions to create a pixelated image guided by a numerical system. As the series progresses, the catalog of previous trees, each denoted by a different hue, appears on every subsequent triptych, resulting in a prismatic kaleidoscope of layered colors. The cumulative effect bridges the expressive sublime with the schematic referent.<\/p> <p>13TH STOP: \u00a0DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (537 W 20TH ST) PRESENTS: STAN DOUGLAS, PHOTOGRAPHS<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/e\/3\/600_448912707.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Held in conjunction with the United States premiere of the artist\u2019s new film installation\u00a0The Secret Agent, the exhibition on view at the gallery in New York will show significant series of works from the late 1980s to the present, includingTelevision Spots\u00a0(1987),\u00a0Malabar People\u00a0(2011), among others.<\/p> <p>The exhibition also marks the New York debut of Douglas\u2019s most recent large-scale photographs, which further the artist\u2019s ongoing\u00a0investigations of photography\u2019s complex and layered relationship to documentation, place, and history.\u00a0In this series of dark, nearly indiscernible\u00a0images, Douglas\u00a0reimagines the postwar urban spaces of his\u00a0native city of\u00a0Vancouver, as it existed\u00a0in 1948, when thousands of people exploited\u00a0loopholes in British Columbia\u2019s property laws to create provisional\u00a0forms of accommodation in public spaces. Drawing on archival photographs and film footage, Douglas has digitally rendered several of these temporary urban structures and communities in minute\u00a0detail. Inspired by film noir, he deploys subtle tonal shifts of black, gray, and white, cloaking the city\u2019s interstitial spaces in shadow, while the eerily quiet scenes and dim pockets of light transform otherwise liminal structures and spaces\u00a0into sophisticated theatrical\u00a0mise-en-sc\u00e8nes. This historical reimagining challenges the conventions of the medium of photography itself, as the resulting hyperreal images are impossible photographs of a time and place unobserved by the camera, yet simultaneously fully dependent on the particularities of that\u00a0time and place.\u00a0As the artist has observed about these works, \u201cIt\u2019s taking a photograph you can\u2019t really take. The places aren\u2019t there anymore and there\u2019s no light.<\/p> <p>14th STOP: JONATHAN LeVINE GALLERY (529 W 20TH ST) PRESENTS: \u00a0DAN WITZ; MOSH PITS, RAVES, AND ONE SMALL ORGY<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/0\/7\/600_448912743.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Witz has evolved from being a pioneer of the street art movement to refining a studio practice that incorporates both digital and old master techniques. Influenced by the work of Renaissance painters Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel, his large-scale oil paintings of rampant crowds embody a rebellious and provocative nature that\u2019s heightened by a stunning hyperreal aesthetic.<\/p> <p><br\/>and ERIK JONES: TWENTY SIXTEEN<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/2\/8\/600_448912776.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Jones challenges viewers to see beauty in his chaotic, mixed-media works that merge nude subjects with nonrepresentational, abstract elements. Describing the human figures in his compositions as \u201caesthetic anchors,\u201d they are the calming foreground upon which bursts of color, stenciled shapes and custom-made stickers create surreal landscapes. Using multiple mediums, such as watercolor, acrylic, colored pencils, wax pastels and oil paint, Jones\u2019 portraits are technically complex and express a heightened sense of realism.<\/p> <p><br\/>The relationship between Jones\u2019 subjects and the abstract motifs that engulf them can be interpreted as conceptual fashion design.

He struggles to provide relevant intelligence and becomes entangled in an ill-fated plot to bomb the Marconi installation outside of Lisbon, an important telephone connection between the country and North America, and thus an umbilical cord between the Old and New Worlds.<\/p> <p>Shooting on location in Lisbon with a cast including local actors,\u00a0The Secret Agent\u00a0revisits a decade also explored in Douglas\u2019s series of photographs\u00a0Disco Angola\u00a0from 2012 and the film\u00a0Luanda-Kinshasa\u00a0from 2013. While these works addressed postcolonial liberation struggles and the African influence on the New York music scene, respectively,\u00a0The Secret Agent\u00a0invokes a broader narrative concerning changing notions of collective identity and the legacy of the modernist worldview.<\/p> <p>The work is composed of twelve episodes that are paired by scene on six screens. Positioned in the center of the installation, the viewer becomes immersed in a given scene and must adopt the role of an editor to focus attention on any one part of the action. Characteristic of Douglas\u2019s multilayered and nonlinear films, many of the scenes are shot from differing viewpoints and overlap chronologically. The overall narrative is divided into two sections, before and after a main event that is anticipated and dealt with, but never explicitly shown.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFEE: $5.00 payable to your tour guide Joey at the start of event\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet out front of our 1st gallery, Paul Kasmin Gallery 297 10th Ave @ 27th","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GuySocialNyc\/events\/230003795\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":14400000,"name":"GUY GALLERY WALK: APRIL EDITION","id":"230003795","time":1460826000000,"updated":1460842534000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383018152000,"name":"GUY SOCIAL NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10885132,"urlname":"GuySocialNyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"GUYS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10017","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"153 E 53rd street","address_2":"and Lexington","lon":-73.970444,"phone":"000-000-0000","name":"CitiCorp Atrium","id":98552,"state":"NY","lat":40.758438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.18020117283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459169364000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be in the public space at the Citicorp atrium.

Clarice Lispector was a Brazilian writer who has been described as possibly the most important Jewish writer since Franz Kafka. Acclaimed internationally for her innovative novels and short stories, she was also a journalist. Because they are so short, we are going to tackle two of her most critically acclaimed novels: <i>The Passion According to G.H<\/i>. (220 pages), and <i>The Hour of the Star<\/i> (120 pages).\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>The Passion According to G.H.<\/i> was published in 1964 and is considered one of the most important works of Brazilian fiction. It is a mystical novel that takes the form of a monologue by a woman, identified only as G.H., telling of the crisis that ensued the previous day after she crushed a cockroach in the door of a wardrobe. Its canonical status was recognized in 1988 by its inclusion in the Arquivos Collection, the UNESCO series of critical editions of the greatest works of Latin American literature. It has been translated into English twice, the first time in 1988, and then again in 2012.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>The Hour of the Star<\/i> is Lispector's last novel, published in 1977 shortly after her death. It has been described as \"philosophical fiction.\" It deals with the problems of the rural Northeast versus the urban Southeast, poverty and the dream of a better life, and, of an uneducated woman\u2019s struggle to survive in a sexist society. This novel, too, has been translated into English twice, first in 1992, and then again in 2011.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/228444472\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":5400000,"name":"Clarice Lispector's The Hour of the Star and The Passion According to G.H.","id":"228444472","time":1460838600000,"updated":1460988709000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Iselin","address_1":"1703 Woodbridge Commons Way","name":"Pooja's Home","lon":-74.313972,"id":24438600,"state":"NJ","lat":40.557987,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.594039917,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455665040000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Friends, this will be our very first meeting.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>(photo of atrium and location of meetup table)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/4\/0\/600_433449280.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(photo of atrium entrance at the corner of 53rd and Lex.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm.

Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs. Subs should enter mid-game (one of the teams reaches 6 points) and should start the following game.

Krishna Kshetra Swami received initiation from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder Acarya of International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in 1972. In 1987 Krishna Kshetra Swami was appointed as an initiating spiritual master (guru) of ISKCON. From 1991 to 1994 he was appointed as ISKCON's deity worship monitor. In 1994 he compiled a handbook for deity worship, Pancaratra Pradipa, in order to establish a standard of worship in ISKCON temples. From 1991 to 1995 he helped developed the Vaisnava Library at the Gurukula school in Mayapur. During the '90s, Krishna Kshetra Swami travelled around Europe sharing Krishna consciousness and inspiring devotees in different temples. The highlight of his travels were many concerts performed by the Gauranga Bhajan Band, often before audiences as large as 10,000. Krishna Kshetra Swami was a lead singer of ecstatic kirtans in the Gauranga Bhajan Band.<\/p> <p>In recent years, wishing to help develop systematic education within ISKCON, he earned a Ph.D. in Religious Studies at Oxford University and has taught at the University of Florida and Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is currently the Dean of Studies at Bhaktivedanta College, Radhadesh, and a permanent Research Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies.<\/p> <p>Together with Radhikaramana das, he has edited \u201cThe Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition\u201d (Columbia University Press). Together they are now preparing an abridged Srimad Bhagavatam with the same publisher.<\/p> <p>Krishna Kshetra Swami is now based in Oxford, U.K., and in Radhadesh, Belgium. On August 17, 2014, he accepted the sannyasa order of life (lifetime commitment as a renunciate).

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty-five years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation\u00a0of $10.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. \u00a0Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> by the name Krishna.<\/p> <p>Here is\u00a0the general schedule of our\u00a0meetups:\u00a0we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 Then, we\u00a0have a class on <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>, which lasts\u00a0for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the class, we will go through verses of the <i>Gita<\/i> in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. \u00a0By about 7:30, the last kirtan\u00a0begins;\u00a0it lasts for about 30 minutes. \u00a0A\u00a0sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p> <p>Admission to each meetup is free. \u00a0Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p> <p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in courts throughout the country, with his office in Long Island, and his concentration in securities and derivative litigation. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/229500095\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Special Guest Gita Teacher: His Holiness Krishna Kshetra Swami","id":"mptgrlyvgbvb","time":1460842200000,"updated":1460972968000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"17 Lexington Ave (& 23rd St)","name":"Baruch College Mason Hall Auditorium","lon":-73.984573,"id":19014442,"state":"NY","lat":40.73896,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.815630316734,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456706979000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's go together to experience the exciting &amp; inspiring vibrations and synchronization of traditional Japanese taiko drumming!

No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Carnism is sustained by complex, hidden social and psychological mechanisms, and it is most harmful when unrecognized.<\/p> <p>Using powerful imagery and the thought-provoking analyses developed by psychologist Dr. Melanie Joy, Jennifer elucidates how, although unjust belief systems (racism, sexism, ableism, etc.) all are unique, the mentality that enables such systems is strikingly similar. When unnoticed, these \u201cisms\u201d can cause us to act against our core values, our own interests, and the interests of others. By illuminating carnism, this presentation helps us become more empowered citizens and more active social witnesses. Audiences appreciate the accessible, engaging and levelheaded approach, regardless of their dietary choices.<\/p> <p><i>Parental\/guardian discretion is advised for younger attendees.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/d\/3\/600_447451699.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Jennifer Greene<\/b> is a sociologist who holds a master's degree from the University of Michigan and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rice University. She is especially interested in social justice and human-animal relationships. \u00a0In addition to her work with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carnism.org\/\">Beyond Carnism<\/a>, Jennifer is also founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Vegan-Long-Island\/\">Vegan Long Island Meetup<\/a>, collaborator with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthyschoolfood.org\/\">Coalition for Healthy School Food<\/a>, author of two food-education curricula, and an active volunteer with <a href=\"http:\/\/citizensclimatelobby.org\/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Jennifer's presentation is based on the award-winning book by social psychologist Dr. Melanie Joy, founder and president of\u00a0Beyond Carnism.

Dairy\u2014this includes animal-sourced butter\/ghee, milk, cream, yogurt, cheese. There are vegan versions of all these. Be aware that some products marketed as \"veggie\" or \"soy cheese\" or \"lactose-free\" still contain casein, the milk protein. \u00a0(Look for \"vegan\" or the V symbol on the packaging if you're not sure.) Using chocolate in baking? Check the packaging to confirm it's dairy-free.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3.

The purpose for this event is to create connections between different student leaders in the north Jersey area. Think of this event as a similar networking event the SGA or the office Student Life hosts in your university. The difference between this event and the networking event in your university is that we'll have different student leaders from different universities at this event.<\/p> <p>This event will be ran in an unconference style. Overall, what this means is that we will have discussion based sessions where you guys (Student Leaders) will bring the topics you would like to talk about, and we'll all give our opinions, suggestions, and comments on the topic.\u00a0 Sample topics would be the following:<\/p> <p>1. How to publicize for an event<\/p> <p>2. How to recruit new members<\/p> <p>3. How to deal with a lazy Eboard member<\/p> <p>4. How to effectively train new eboard members<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Get me?<\/p> <p>In the education field, they have these unconference events where different educators come together to gain and share knowledge about any topics regarding education; they are called edcamps. We are essentially using that same model, but we'll focus on topics that relate to student-ran organizations.

Today, with the neighborhood fully gentrified, it feels vital to remember this lost world, and Diego Echeverria\u2019s essential documentary, shot in the early eighties on 16mm, brings it all back to life, through the eyes of five different residents. Rediscovered in 2007, the film has become a cornerstone program of the Williamsburg arts nonprofit UnionDocs, which not only restored the film but in 2010 began the \u201cLiving Los Sures\u201d historical memory project, an expansive documentary project about the Southside of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nIt will also be preceded by this:<\/p> <p><br\/>Of Memory &amp; Los Sures (2011) is a hybrid animated documentary film directed and produced by Andrew Parsons &amp; Laurie Sumiye featuring oral histories of longtime residents of Los Sures. Voices of longtime residents are juxtaposed with images suggesting a recently disappearing past.

The five stories are framed within the pages of a comic book which a boy's insensitive father has thrown in the garbage. The first tale, \"Father's Day,\" features a zombie patriarch returning to claim his Father's Day cake; \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" stars King himself as a slack-jawed yokel whose discovery of a radioactive meteorite turns him into a walking weed; \"Something to Tide You Over\" presents a deadly-serious\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/leslie-nielsen-p52664\">Leslie Nielsen<\/a>\u00a0as a cuckolded husband who plans an elaborate seaside revenge; \"The Crate\" unleashes its ferocious man-eating contents on the enemies of a meek college professor; and \"They're Creeping Up On You\" pits obsessively-clean billionaire\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/eg-marshall-p45786\">E.G.

The drivers can choose how many of each they would like to use throughout the weekend, but are required to use at least two different compounds for the race.<\/p> <p><b>DRS ZONES<\/b> -\u00a0The Shanghai International Circuit will feature two DRS zones - the back straight (between turns 13 and 14) and the start-finish straight (between turns 16 and 1) each with individual detection points.<\/p> <p>So can Nico Rosberg continue his winning streak?

Covey<\/p> <p>Review from Amazon.com:<\/p> <p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change\u00a0was a groundbreaker when it was first published in 1990, and it continues to be a business bestseller with more than 10 million copies sold. Stephen Covey, an internationally respected leadership authority, realizes that true success encompasses a balance of personal and professional effectiveness, so this book is a manual for performing better in both arenas. His anecdotes are as frequently from family situations as from business challenges. Before you can adopt the seven habits, you'll need to accomplish what Covey calls a \"paradigm shift\"--a change in perception and interpretation of how the world works. Covey takes you through this change, which affects how you perceive and act regarding productivity, time management, positive thinking, developing your \"proactive muscles\" (acting with initiative rather than reacting), and much more. This isn't a quick-tips-start-tomorrow kind of book. The concepts are sometimes intricate, and you'll want to study this book, not skim it. When you finish, you'll probably have Post-it notes or hand-written annotations in every chapter, and you'll feel like you've taken a powerful seminar by Covey.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Early-Risers-Book-Club\/events\/229546694\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Club Meeting 9","id":"229546694","time":1460896200000,"updated":1460908389000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1447698818000,"name":"Early Risers' Book Club","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":19127628,"urlname":"Early-Risers-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Fellow readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07087","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Union City","address_1":"400 Paterson Plank","lon":-74.041046,"phone":" (201) 319-3749","name":"Washington Park","id":720031,"state":"NJ","lat":40.751785,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.68029260635,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459219698000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us for outdoor tennis at Washington Park in Union City, which is off of the 9th Street light rail station.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/230276222\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvgbwb","time":1460898000000,"updated":1460910213000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456090587000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i> (MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

This is for your safety and to help keep the group moving at a consistent pace. It's a good idea to bring your Metrocard and some cash in case you need to cut the run short.<\/p> <p><i>IMPORTANT: It's winter, so the water fountains are turned off in all City Parks. Be sure to bring along any fluids and\/or nutrition you may need to successfully complete this distance as we'd like to make minimal stops.

That will get us to the end of our four-bridge tour in time for a lunch stop at South Street Seaport.<\/p> <p>The ride kicks off with a short pedal up the Hudson River Greenway to the North Cove Yacht Harbor in Battery Park City. We'll have great views of the new Freedom Tower and the Winter Garden Atrium. Then we'll cross Manhattan on Warren Street to City Hall before beginning our ride across the Brooklyn Bridge.<\/p> <p>From the Brooklyn Bridge we'll have fantastic views of South Street Seaport and the Wall Street area to the south and the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges to the north. Once back on the ground we'll make a few short turns through Brooklyn's DUMBO area (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) before beginning our assent of the Manhattan Bridge. Now we get a great view of the historic Brooklyn Bridge to the south and a closer view of the Williamsburg Bridge to the north.<\/p> <p>We'll land back in Manhattan on Canal Street, on the borderline of Chinatown and Little Italy. After a few more turns through Manhattan's lower east side we'll reach Delancey Street and start our way across the bike-friendly Williamsburg Bridge. From the steel cantilever structure of the Williamsburg Bridge we'll have our first view of the Queensboro Bridge to the north and the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the south.<\/p> <p>We'll land in Williamsburg, Brooklyn... the start of a three mile pedal that will take us through the ethnically rich Bushwick and Greenpoint sections. Then we'll cross over the Maspeth Creek and Long Island Expressway into Queens on the smaller Pulaski Bridge. After another 1.5-mile ride we'll arrive at Queens Boulevard and can begin our climb of the Queensboro Bridge.<\/p> <p>The Queensboro Bridge,with its five spans, is the longest of the four East River bridges we'll cross. That's because it crosses the residential area of Roosevelt Island before arriving in Manhattan. The official name of the bridge, as of 2010, is the Ed Koch Bridge. The bridge is also known as the 59th Street Bridge, the name shared by the famous Simon and Garfunkel tune (a.k.a. Feelin' Groovy).<\/p> <p>From the steel cantilever structure of the Queensboro bridge we'll have a view of Roosevelt Island, the Triborough Bridge, and the Hell Gate Bridge to the north. We'll look south to see the United Nations and southwest at the spectacular skyline of midtown Manhattan. We'll land in Manhattan on 60th Street, the bottom edge of the exclusive upper east side. From there we'll find our way to 2nd Avenue where we'll head south to 34th street.<\/p> <p>The rest of our southbound ride will be on the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, where we'll have spectacular views as we pass back under three of the four East River bridges.<\/p> <p>We'll take our lunch break at South Street Seaport before riding the last mile back to Battery Park.<\/p> <p>The whole ride, with stoppage time, should be about 3-1\/2 hours. It's well suited for road, hybrid, or mountain bikes. Most of the ride will be flat, but there will be four significant climbs (each with at least a 150 foot vertical rise). That means this is probably not a good ride for first-time riders. That said, the bridge climbs are gradual but long, so even with a little bit of experience, novice riders will be fine with the bridge climbs.<\/p> <p>Here's a link to the ride map: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyride.com\/routes\/fullscreen\/367001071\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyride.com\/routes\/fullscreen\/367001071\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mapmyride.com\/routes\/fullscreen\/367001071\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Join us for this scenic ride over four remarkable bridges.<\/p> <p>TERMS OF PARTICIPATION<\/p> <p>By registering and participating in this Big Weekend Adventures event, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the following statement:<\/p> <p>I understand that bicycling involves certain dangers and risks which I am prepared to assume for myself and all children accompanying me.

Take the path leading into central park, and go left (up the slope) until you get to the clearing at the top of the hill. If it's rainy or bad weather, I won't be there, but if the suns out, you can find me under the hill. I will let the group know ahead of time if I have to cancel in advance. The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together. Look forward to seeing all of you!<\/p> <p>This meditation is free.

There's lot's of technical expertise, lurkers, newbies, and interested friends just hanging out, so even if you don't race, you can still fly, take videos, or just watch and learn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPlease check in at the line of canopies at the end of the parking area and ask for Frank.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0\n<b>Suggested equipment to bring:<\/b><br\/>Your aircraft(s), props and batteries, repair equipment<br\/>Something to sit on \u2013 this is an open field.<br\/>Something to sit under like a small (or large) canopy. Team members do bring canopies to manage their equipment and make repairs. We ask that everyone respects the space they need to operate comfortably.\u00a0<\/p> <p>AMA License: If you plan on flying, you can get it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses (for young pilots under 13 it is HIGHLY recommended)\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Sunscreen and water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING<\/b>:<br\/><b>NO FLY ZONE<\/b>: For safety, the no fly zone is \"IN, ABOVE AND BEHIND\" the line formed by the pilot pit area. You may not operate your quad behind or to the right of the last canopy. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there are lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control or not.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FLY ZONE<\/b>: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone . Please pilot your aircraft from within the pit area (aka the no-fly-zone). If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intentions so other pilots can avoid you. During free flight\/ practice. you may enter the field by announcing \u201cON THE FIELD\u201d loudly to entire pit area.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>CRASH &amp; TRASH<\/b>: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless and keep the park rangers happy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>KIDS<\/b>: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>\"ZERO HARM\" RESPONSIBLE FLYING:<\/b> Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious oriented and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. IOW, if you are about to have a collision, especially with a dog, bird, human, or any living thing, think \"zero harm\" first and do everything you can to avoid the collision and immediately divert your flight path even if it means at the expense of your own rig. Living things are a lot harder to repair than metal and electronics and typically don't require litigation to fix. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>RACING<\/b>: Know your skill limits and pilot your quad accordingly. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx channel \"X\" , or the most critical, \"VIDEO VIDEO!\" and so on. It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. But beyond this, most importantly, have a blast of fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT <\/b><br\/>Since most pilots are using the 5.8ghz video transmitter bands for FPV video, so please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark\/Immersion or Boscam) and frequency channel. Every pilot uses this technology to fly their aircraft safely, so it is imperative that every pilot understands and operates using safe video transmission practices.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>THE BASICS: <\/b><br\/>1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. LOOK THROUGH YOU GOGGLES FIRST. Someone may accidentally be on the channel you were assigned. Listen intently when you do (even if you have a frequency tag), and if you hear a pilot exclaim that they've lost signal, power down immediately. Flying blind is a dangerous situation and is to be avoided at all costs.<br\/>2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles\/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping.<br\/>3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video .<br\/>4) For racing, the racing coordinator(s) will make frequency assignments and assign spotters.<br\/>5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Looking forward to seeing you there!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check \"Location\" section of meetup","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SafetyThirdRacing-FPV-Drone-Racing\/events\/229904999\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"S3 Racing - Public Event - CHYZOWYCH FIELD, Maplewood, NJ","id":"229904999","time":1460905200000,"updated":1460997779000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441089231000,"name":"Safety Third Racing - FPV Drone Racing and Building","group_lon":-74.4499969482,"id":18888053,"urlname":"SafetyThirdRacing-FPV-Drone-Racing","group_lat":40.4900016785,"who":"Pilots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Garwood","address_1":"340,North Ave","name":"JoSan Lu","lon":-74.324936,"id":24480410,"state":"NJ","lat":40.653545,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.8057422638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460341370000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Free introduction to Thetahealing.

The Sunday School Graduation Rite of Passage, completed by our 8th graders, allows them to present to the community how their Sunday School experience has informed their moral and ethical development.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EthicalFocus\/events\/229760955\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Cyrus Collier","id":"qcmtklyvgbwb","time":1460905200000,"updated":1460917232000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202088040000,"name":"The Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":991158,"urlname":"EthicalFocus","group_lat":40.8899993896,"who":"humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"224 West 20th Street","name":"Cafe Grumpy","lon":-73.99839,"id":11661622,"state":"NY","lat":40.742573,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":0.677000403404,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1460244943000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The NY state primary is upon us and the candidates have been wreaking havoc across the state - but particularly in our fair city, where the high concentration of voters makes it a particularly irresistible target for would-be presidential nominees.<\/p> <p>We'll chat about our thoughts on the candidates, their trajectories, and what a good (or bad) showing in our state might mean for \"momentum\" going forward.<\/p> <p>If anything else pressing comes up in the news (there hasn't been any large shift in the Belgian terrorism investigation, so I'm leaving the topic off for more time to discuss US politics) I'll add it to the list before Sunday.<\/p> <p><br\/>**Note: We're returning to Cafe Grumpy this week but are capping attendance at 12 due to space issues.

Claudius' untimely (or well-timed) death, in turn made his adopted son Nero emperor. Nero's promising start soon took a dark turn, which marked his legacy. He is best remembered for his depravity, murder of his mother, tutor and countless others as well as his rebuilding of Rome following the great fire, which he is famously thought to have started or watched indifferently while pursuing his musical interests.

New members welcome. (Each person pays $1 cash at the meetings, just to help offset the costs of having the group hosted here on MeetUp.com.)<\/p> <p>Every week, we meet from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. Usually, we work through Julia Cameron's creativity building techniques (for example those in The Artist's Way and The Prosperous Heart). We start each session discussing the current week's activity (morning pages, artist's dates, synchronicities, creative endeavors, etc) and then participate in an agreed upon exercise\/task (bring paper and pen please).<\/p> <p><br\/>Normally, on the\u00a0third Sunday of the month, we share our artistic projects in a kind of \"Show &amp; Tell\" so that we can get to know each other's work and support it. Not mandatory - only for those who wish to share or present their work.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a very creative and supportive small group.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/230105491\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"cvdgrlyvgbwb","time":1460908800000,"updated":1460920513000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11568","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Old Westbury","address_1":"71 Old Westbury Rd","lon":-73.602315,"phone":"516-333-0048","name":"Old Westbury Gardens","id":758522,"state":"NY","lat":40.775423,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.4058418274,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460734840000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For those that can't attend Saturday session with the group ie: Jane - I'm coordinating Sunday 12pm.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the top of the sidewalk that leads to the mansion, there's a long brick wall that everyone can meet at","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/cavalierspaniel-48\/events\/230398565\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"DOG DAYS at Old Westbury Gardens LI, SUNDAY OPTION April 17th 12:00pm","id":"230398565","time":1460908800000,"updated":1460947266000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1141410607000,"name":"New York Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":226352,"urlname":"cavalierspaniel-48","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Cavalier Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"207 5th Ave","name":"Body Reserve Gym","lon":-73.980309,"id":24274751,"state":"NY","lat":40.676109,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.1411113739,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452886207000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Are you looking for a complementary training to <b>ENHANCE<\/b> your overall well being on and off the track, to be more <b>FLEXIBLE <\/b>and <b>RELEASE<\/b> physical, mental and emotional tensions?<\/p> <p><br\/>Are you looking for <b>RELIEF<\/b> from joint wear, tightness, pain, and\/or discomfort?<\/p> <p>$5 FOR FIRST CLASS TO CROSS TRAIN...<\/p> <p>_________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b><i>About <\/i><i>Yin Yang Yoga...<\/i><\/b><b><i>A typical Yoga class is \u2018Yang\u2019 in style and focuses on active heating and muscular contraction - by starting with \u2018Yin\u2019, a more passive, nourishing, and cooling practice, this uniquely designed class WILL enhance your alignment, performance, and overall sense of balance!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why For Runners\/Athletes?<\/b> - Lengthening and releasing effect from repetitive movements on sheets of connective tissue can overtime shorten and tighten it in ingrained patterns around the muscles.

While surrendering into the edge of each pose (for 2-5 minutes), students are guided to experience the\u00a0discomforting stagnant energy and its release around the hips, thighs, and lower back, and be connected to the present moment. The Yang flow sequence designed to follow will allow students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for greater circulation and achieve new level of flexibility and energy. \u00a0Guided Relaxation provided at the end will promise to be YUMMY!<\/p> <p>__________________________________________________<\/p> <p><i><b>Testimonies x3: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

A lot of groups in New York have language exchange in which English and Mandarin are both being used but English ends-up becoming the predominant language of each group meeting.

Your level of Mandarin should be between intermediate and advanced but all are welcome as long as they speak in Mandarin.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We understand some things that are complex must be explained in English but we do not encourage it.<\/p> <p>*ALL ARE WELCOME BUT MUST MAKE CONVERSATION IN MANDARIN<\/p> <p>*PLEASE DO NOT FEEL INTIMIDATED TO COME AND JOIN US<\/p> <p>We should be done by 2:30pm but you all are welcome to stick around as long you'd like.<\/p> <p>Thanks again for your support thus far and let's have many more great meetups! \u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u5927\u5bb6\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff01<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queens-Chinese-and-English-Language-Exchange-Meetup\/events\/230103091\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Chat at Fay Da Bakery (Practice Mandarin with Advanced Speakers)","id":"230103091","time":1460910600000,"updated":1460918956000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425082654000,"name":"Queens Chinese and English Language Exchange Meetup","group_lon":-73.8199996948,"id":18466189,"urlname":"Queens-Chinese-and-English-Language-Exchange-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Language geeks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Staten Island","address_1":"One Richmond Terrace","name":"St. George Ferry Terminal on Staten Island","lon":-74.075119,"id":24421108,"state":"NY","lat":40.642212,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":34,"distance":8.69807815552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":38,"created":1459443441000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":9,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY, ESPECIALLY THE BOLD TYPE.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you are registered for this walk and can't attend, please change your RSVP online from \"YES\" to \"NO\".\u00a0THERE IS NO NEED TO POST WHY YOU CAN'T MAKE THE EVENT.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BRING SUN PROTECTION, COMFORTABLE WALKING SHOES, LUNCH,\u00a0WATER, AND AN EXTRA LAYER OF CLOTHING(THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED UP ON HILLS OR RIDGES WITH BEAUTIFUL VIEWS, BUT IT MIGHT BE COOLER UP THERE.)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH A FIVE AND ONE HALF MILE, MODERATE PACED WALK WITH\u00a0SOME UPS AND DOWNS, THEN THIS WALK IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

The garden is features flowers and plants mentioned in his poems and plays, with small bronze plaques scattered throughout the garden with quotes from the Bard.<\/p> <p>The garden was first conceived in the 1880s when park commissioner George Clausen asked the Park's entomologist to create a garden adjacent to the nature study center in the Swedish Cottage. In 1913, Commissioner Gaynor dedicated it officially to the works of Shakespeare. After years of neglect, Shakespeare Garden, just as most of Central Park, fell into disrepair. In 1987, Central Park Conservancy restored and expanded the garden, repaving pathways and installing rustic wooden benches and bronze plaques with quotations from the Bard's masterpiece.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side between 79th and 80th Streets.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Ramble<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/assets\/images\/2014\/things-to-see-and-do\/Ramble-750.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To use the words of Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, The Ramble is a 38-acre \"wild garden.\" \u00a0Central Park's designers imagined a tranquil spot where visitors could stroll, discover forest gardens rich with plantings, and meander along the paths. This truly is a place for the urban explorer to escape the city and get utterly lost in nature.<\/p> <p>This was one of the first parts of the Park to be built, and except for the bedrock platform, it is totally artificial. Even the water running in the stream and the adjacent Lake is turned on and off like a faucet. Some of the trees you see date back to 1859 when the Ramble was planted.<\/p> <p>Beneath the leafy canopy, you are surrounded by a thriving wildlife habitat. Because of its location on the Atlantic Flyway \u2014\u00a0the migration route birds follow in the spring and fall \u2014 the Ramble is the center of birding activity in the Park. Over 230 species have been spotted, and over 40 other species remain in the Park all year long.<\/p> <p>Every year, more than 25 million people visit Central Park, which is more than any other urban Park in the world. By working with environmental groups, the Central Park Conservancy has developed a woodland restoration and management plan, which involves your participation as well.<\/p> <p>First, \"carry in, carry out.\" \u00a0All of the trash and recycling bins have been removed from inside the Ramble, and placed at the entrances. If you enjoy a picnic in this beautiful setting, don't forget to take your leftovers with you and dispose of them properly. It's a simple gesture, but it really helps the environment and the Conservancy staff responsible for its care.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park from 73rd to 79th Streets.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506619071\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nBelvedere Castle<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/belvedere-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Calvert Vaux, co-designer of Central Park, created the miniature castle in 1869 as one of its many whimsical structures intended as a lookout to the reservoir to the north (now the Great Lawn) and the Ramble to the south. Belvedere provides the best and highest views of the Park and its cityscape. It's fitting, considering its name translates to \"beautiful view\" in Italian.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\"Right now, the temperature in Central Park is...\" Since 1919, the National Weather Service has taken measurements onf New York's weather from the castle's tower with the aid of scientific instruments that measure wind speed and direction. In a fenced-in compound just south of the castle, other data such as the rainfall is recorded and sent to the weather service's forecast office at Brookhaven National Library on Long Island.

The angel carries a lily in her left hand \u2014\u00a0a symbol of the water's purity, very important to a city that had previously suffered from a devastating cholera epidemic before the system was established.

After decades of deterioration, Central Park Conservancy renovated and reopened the castle in 1983 as a visitor center.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park at 79th Street<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506618184\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Details<\/p> <p><b>Open Hours:<\/b><\/p> <p>10am-5pm daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day<\/p> <p><b>Phone:<\/b>\u00a0[masked]<\/p> <p>\n\nBethesda Fountain<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/bethesda-fountain-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Rising from Bethesda Terrace is Bethesda Fountain, with the famous Angel of the Waters statue atop. The statue references the Gospel of John, which describes an angel blessing the Pool of Bethesda and giving it healing powers. The fountain commemorates the Croton water system, which first brought fresh water to New York City in 1842. The angel carries a lily in her left hand \u2014\u00a0a symbol of the water's purity, very important to a city that had previously suffered from a devastating cholera epidemic before the system was established. The piece is the only statue that was commissioned for the Park. Created by Emma Stebbins, it also marked the first time a woman received a public art commission in New York City.<\/p> <p><br\/>Mid-Park on the north side of 72nd Street<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>SUBWAY DIRECTION :\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>TAKE # 6 TO 96 STREET AND WALK TOWARDS TO\u00a0Madison \u00a0Ave or Take M 86 bus from there.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bus:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0M-1,M-2,M-3 and M-4 : Madison Ave bus to 96 street .

The tunnel, built in 1844 by the Long Island Rail Road, was sealed up in 1861 and its reality was completely forgotten. The \"Atlantic Avenue Tunnel\" was reported in contemporary newspapers to have been the location of several violent deaths, and a venue for poltergeist activity, shadow people, \"river pirates\", smugglers and thieves, bootleggers, a Presidential Assassin (John Wilkes Booth)- as well as a circa 1836 wood burning steam locomotive.<\/p> <p>Although no one could find a way inside, or even prove it really still existed, the tunnel's mystique\u00a0attracted a variety of researchers, ranging from\u00a0a certain CIA Director of Counter Intelligence, to a then 19 year old college student who in 1980, actually got inside, and rediscovered the tunnel and its amazing history. Bob Diamond will be regaling us with his presentation on the past, present and future of this unique historical resource, which has captured the imagination and prose of writers ranging from Walt Whitman to H.P. Lovecraft.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><b>: <\/b>A life long Brooklynite, from a very early age, Bob Diamond has always had a duel passion for science and history. When he was a high school senior,\u00a0Bob won a science contest for alternative energy sources. The reward was\u00a0meeting some fascinating people. Later, Bob used these contacts to provide logistical support for his rediscovery of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel. Bob has been the President of the non profit Brooklyn Historic Railway Assn. since 1982, and has recently created seven books of modern rail transit technology.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/tracks.lionel.com\/abandoned-and-buried-the-worlds-first-subway-tunnel-and-the-trapped-locomotive\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tracks.lionel.com\/abandoned-and-buried-the-worlds-first-subway-tunnel-and-the\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tracks.lionel.com\/abandoned-and-buried-the-worlds-first-subway-tunnel-and-the<\/a>-<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/tracks.lionel.com\/abandoned-and-buried-the-worlds-first-subway-tunnel-and-the-trapped-locomotive\/\">trapped-locomotive\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Please plan to attend what is bound to be one of the most interesting DNNY meetings to date and invite your interested friends to join us.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details<\/b><b>: <\/b>Admission $10 per person.

Please contact Meri at [masked] with your date of birth, time and city, so Meri can create your astrology chart, showing the Behenian Fixed Stars - if you have any in your chart.<\/p> <p>The Behenian fixed stars are a selection of fifteen stars considered especially useful for magical applications in the medieval astrology of Europe and the Arab world. Their name derives from Arabic bahman, \"root,\" as each was considered a source of astrological power for one or more planets. Each is also connected with a gemstone and plant that would be used in rituals meant to draw the star's influence (e.g., into a talisman). When a planet was within six degrees of an associated star, this influence was thought to be particularly strong.<\/p> <p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa discussed them in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy (Book II, chapters 47 &amp; 52) as the Behenii (singular Behenius), describing their magical workings and kabbalistic symbols. He attributed these to Hermes Trismegistus, as was common with occult traditions in the Middle Ages.

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

This week, Mathias\u00a0will be talking to us about his latest machine learning project! Join us!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Mathias<\/b><\/p> <p>Mathias Brandewinder has been developing software on .NET for about 10 years, and loving every minute of it, except maybe for a few release days. His language of choice was C#, until he discovered F# and fell in love with it. He enjoys arguing about code and how to make it better, and gets very excited when discussing TDD or F#. His other professional interests include forecasting models, machine learning and applying math to solve business problems. Mathias is a Microsoft F# MVP and the founder of Clear Lines Consulting. He is based in San Francisco, blogs at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandewinder.com\/\">www.brandewinder.com<\/a>, and can be found on Twitter as @Brandewinder<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>ABSTRACT<\/b><\/p> <p>Just like traditional applications development, machine learning involves writing code. One aspect where the two differ is the workflow. While software development follows a fairly linear process (design, develop, and deploy a feature), machine learning is a different beast. You work on a single feature, which is never 100% complete. You constantly run experiments, and re-design your model in depth at a rapid pace. Traditional tests are entirely useless. Validating whether you are on the right track takes minutes, if not hours.<\/p> <p>\n\nIn this talk, we will take the example of a Machine Learning competition we recently participated in, the Kaggle Home Depot competition, to illustrate what \"doing Machine Learning\" looks like. We will explain the challenges we faced, and how we tackled them, setting up a harness to easily create and run experiments, while keeping our sanity. We will also draw comparisons with traditional software development, and highlight how some ideas translate from one context to the other, adapted to different constraints.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Take the Path to Hoboken and we're 2 blocks away on 2nd and River Street.

It could be processes that aren\u2019t optimized, poor tools, team members who aren\u2019t right for the job, managers who are reminiscent of the pointed-hair boss on Dilbert, or a host of other reasons. Solving that is going to be the focus of our April 18th meeting.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s been about 12 years since Bob Jarvis last presented at NY SPIN (Experiences Combining Extreme Programming (XP) with Six Sigma and CMMI). This time, he will be discussing something else which he\u2019s passionate about \u2013 unlocking the potential of workers by removing the obstacles that get in the way of them doing their best work. Clearly this is partially a process issue, but there are several other key dimensions that also need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>In this interactive session, Bob will provide a high-level walk-through of a framework to identify the real symptoms, an approach to presenting the results to management so they \u201cget it,\u201d and an implementation cycle to fix the root causes.

The suddenly,\u00a0they\u00a0were tasked with ferrying one of these mysterious items and the courier carrying it to somewhere it would be safe.<\/p> <p><br\/>They learned quickly that numerous were those with interest in what they\u00a0possessed. Their mission was immediately fraught with danger and the party was running for its life. Then, just as quickly as it had started, it was over. The adventurers became separated from many in their group including Melrick, the wizard that had hired them to protect his journey.<\/p> <p><br\/>They passed\u00a0through\u00a0an alien realm they\u00a0soon\u00a0became certain was the dark realm known as the Shadowfell. Their stay on the plane of shadow was short-lived, however, and\u00a0they soon found themselves back in the natural world. But they were very far from home and a number of their comrades were not with them.<\/p> <p><br\/>What will Robin, Meline, Trask, Poe, Zyle, and Malako do now? Do they try to reunite with their mates and finish their mission? If so, how will they go about finding them? These are questions they all ponder and one of their number does so along with the realization that they\u2019ve arrived at his homeland.

We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Monday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game.

Designers, developers, and product owners are finding themselves positioned to build their own cutting-edge natural language interfaces and to learn the disciplines of voice design and development at the same time.<\/p> <p>In this discussion, Tanya Kraljic and Adam Emfield of Nuance will share their take on this space by way of their experience researching, designing, and using Nuance\u2019s new developer ecosystem and natural language customization tool, Mix.nlu.

One of the worst things about socialists is that they either fail to understand, or just outright reject, the basic laws of supply and demand. So they set wages too high, which eliminates jobs, and set prices too low, which eliminates goods and services. From <i>The Economist<\/i> last week, describing socialist Venezuela: <i>Visiting a supermarket in Venezuela is like entering Monty Python's cheese-shop sketch. \u201cDo you have any milk?\u201d The shop assistant shakes her head.

Bear in mind that the cost of living varies a lot by state, so a $15 minimum wage in Mississippi is would be like a $19.21 minimum wage in New York. The fact that <i><b>anyone<\/b><\/i> would claim that a $19-equivalent minimum wage would not kill any jobs just <i>boggles the mind<\/i>. Being underpaid may suck, but being unemployed sucks a lot worse. It is unclear whether Bernie's enthusiasm for a reckless increase in minimum wage stems from his poor grasp of economics, or from the realization that <i>unemployed people are more likely than underpaid people to vote for extremist politicians like himself.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/4\/9\/600_448781289.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>$2 Maximum ATM fee:<\/b> Most banks provide free ATM access at their own ATM's, but private ATM's of the sort found in convenience stores, gas stations, and shopping malls charge fees. If the fee is greater than $2, that probably reflects the fact that the cost of providing the service in higher than that. Some places will cost more than others. In a high-crime neighborhood, the armored car that stocks the ATM will need more guards to prevent it being robbed. In a rural location, the armored car will have to travel a longer distance to re-stock the ATM. What imposing a $2 limit on ATM fees will do is result in ATM's being unavailable in high-crime or rural locations.<\/p> <p><b>15% Maximum Credit Card Interest:<\/b> Right now, if you have a good credit record, you can get credit cheaper than that. If your credit is mediocre, or unknown, that means that, as far as the bank can tell, you are likely to fail to repay your debts, and lenders will have to lend to you at higher interest rates to recoup their losses. A 15% cap on credit card interest means that everyone with mediocre credit (or a lack of credit history) will be unable to get new credit cards.<br\/>Young people starting out have no credit history. When trying to obtain credit, they are caught in a Catch-22 situation \u2013 no one wants to be the first to lend to them. What's more, being young, they haven't had time to save up a \u201crainy day\u201d fund to boot. A 15% cap on interest means that it will take many years longer (with no rainy day fund) for them to get their first credit cards. And if you have credit cards and lose them in a rough patch, it will take that much longer for you to re-establish yourself again.<\/p> <p>-----------------------<\/p> <p>Bernie describes high-speed trading as \u201crisky and unproductive\u201d, which is just displaying his economic ignorance. In fact, most high-speed trading, like market-making, is quite beneficial, and not very \u201crisky\u201d at all. The book <i>Flash Boys<\/i>, by Michael Lewis, describes \u201cfront-running\u201d, a form of high-speed trading that is not beneficial (but certainly not \u201crisky\u201d), though many people familiar with high-speed trading doubt that front-running is a serious problem, and if it is a problem, the same book describes ways to deal with it without government intervention.<\/p> <p>Bernie claims that the repeal of Glass-Steagall was one of the causes of the financial crisis. According to Ben Bernanke, Obama's Fed chairman: \u201cI don't know why Glass-Steagall became such a poster child for 'deregulation that caused the crisis'. All it did was separate commercial banking from investment banking, and it wasn't the hybrid banks that got into trouble. What's more, Glass-Steagall would have prevented the rescue of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase, and the rescue of Merill Lynch by Bank of America.\u201d. The financial crisis was caused by the fact that hardly anyone was anticipating the crash in real estate prices \u2013 deregulation was not the problem.<\/p> <p>Bernie says that workers in Mexico and China are paid \u201cpennies per hour\u201d \u2013 quite an exaggeration. Actually, the <i><b>MINIMUM<\/b><\/i> wage everywhere in China (and most workers are getting more than that) is over a dollar an hour. And the average <i><b>MINIMUM<\/b><\/i> wage in Mexico is over $5 an hour.<\/p> <p>Bernie, like a true socialist, is bewildered by the most basic economic realities. His website says \u201cit makes no sense\u201d that auto loans are sometimes at lower interest rates than student debt. Has he never heard of <i><b>collateral<\/b><\/i>? If someone doesn't make car payments, the bank can repossess the car. If someone doesn't pay on their student loans, does Bernie expect the bank to \u201crepossess their education\u201d???\u00a0 So student debt is much riskier than auto debt, hence the higher interest rates.\u00a0 Furthermore, car companies often offer auto loans at ridiculously low interest rates (I've seen 0% advertised), subsidized by charging a higher price for the car, a trick that is generally not employed with student loans.<\/p> <p>Bernie says that the assets of the big banks amount to \u201c58% of GDP\u201d, making it sound like they own most of the country, which displays either ignorance, or, more likely, intellectual dishonesty. It's an apples to oranges comparison \u2013 assets, being wealth, is a static quantity, while GDP is a flow. \u201c58% of GDP\u201d is actually more like \u201c10% of the wealth of the country\u201d, the wealth of the country being several times GDP.<\/p> <p>Bernie voted against the 2008 bailout, which tells us a <i><b>LOT<\/b><\/i> about him. Had the rest of the senate voted with him and the government failed to intervene, end the financial panic, and prevent runs on banks, the recession would have been far worse. Many banks would have failed, and with them, many other businesses, not just the banks, would have gone under, too. We would have had unemployment over 20%, quite possibly over 30%. A large fraction of the population has no savings and relies on their credit cards for their \u201crainy day fund\u201d. If Bernie's effort to block the bailouts had been successful and the banks had gone under, those people would have lost their credit cards and found themselves without resources in the mother of all \u201crainy days\u201d indeed. Why did Bernie vote against the bailout? Because he's a hateful, spiteful man, who hates the banks so very deeply that he will do anything he can to screw them, even if it means destroying the whole damn country in the process.<\/p> <p>Sanders is far more offended by wealth than poverty.\u00a0 We saw by his 2008 vote that he would <b><i>MUCH<\/i><\/b> rather impoverish the masses than allow an undeserving few to prosper.\u00a0 In 2008 we faced an emergency which required us to set ideology aside and deal with the problem.\u00a0 Sanders showed that he lacks the flexibility to do that.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front, and I'll have a sign on the table.

He says the the Fed audit he sponsored uncovered \u201c$16 trillion\u201d that was \u201cspent\u201d (\u201cspent\u201d makes it sound like it was never paid back while it was all paid back within a couple of years, and the \u201c$16 trillion\u201d figure was arrived at by accounting sleight-of-hand, in fact the total debt outstanding never amounting to a tenth of that at any point in time). Furthermore, many banks, such as Goldman-Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, were individually solvent and didn't need bailing out. The government felt they needed to bail out <i><b>all<\/b><\/i> the banks to avoid making any banks look bad, to avoid provoking runs. So the banks were all <i><b>forced<\/b><\/i> to take the money, with the management of some of them vehemently protesting, and many of them <b><a href=\"http:\/\/projects.propublica.org\/bailout\/list\">paid the money back<\/a><\/b>, with a profit for the government, immediately when they were permitted to, in June of 2009.<\/p> <p>Bernie promises to prosecute the big banks for the sort of illegal activity that caused the 2008 financial crisis.

The press has played up talk that the rating agencies had a conflict of interest in that they were paid by the banks whose bonds they were rating, but it's not clear they were fraudulent rather than stupid \u2013 if real estate prices had not stopped increasing (and practically nobody in the country anticipated that that they would stop increasing), then when the homeowners failed to make payments, the homes would have been worth more than the loans against them, so that foreclosing on the homes would pay off the loans, and the bonds would not have defaulted. As a result, those bonds would have performed according to their ratings. And even if the rating agencies committed fraud, they are <i><b>still not the banks<\/b><\/i>. If the banks knew what they were doing all along and defrauded someone else, why was it the banks that lost money? If fraud occurred, the banks were <i>victims <\/i>of it, not the <i>perpetrators<\/i>. When being interviewed by the <i>New York Daily News<\/i>, Bernie was unable to name a specific law that was broken that caused the meltdown. This is <i><b>much<\/b><\/i> more significant than Sarah Palin not knowing what the \u201cBush Doctrine\u201d was \u2013 Bernie sells himself, pretty much every time he speaks, as an expert on the criminality of the big banks, yet when asked to name the law that was broken, he comes up blank.<\/p> <p>------------------------<\/p> <p>Bernie consistently shows a poor grasp of economics. One of the worst things about socialists is that they either fail to understand, or just outright reject, the basic laws of supply and demand. So they set wages too high, which eliminates jobs, and set prices too low, which eliminates goods and services. From <i>The Economist<\/i> last week, describing socialist Venezuela: <i>Visiting a supermarket in Venezuela is like entering Monty Python's cheese-shop sketch. \u201cDo you have any milk?\u201d The shop assistant shakes her head. Sugar? No. Coffee? No. Soap? No. Cornflour? No. Cooking oil? No. Do you in fact have any products that the government deems so essential that it fixes their prices at less than what it costs to make them? No.<\/i> Bernie wants to:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0set the federal minimum wage too high (discussed below)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0impose a $2 maximum ATM fee (discussed below)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0impose a %15 maximum on credit card interest (discussed below)<\/p> <p><b>Minimum wage:<\/b> Hillary wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 (which is higher, in inflation-adjusted terms, than it has ever been), and leave it to individual states with high costs of living, like New York and California, to set higher state minimum wages, while Bernie wants to set it to $15 <i><b>everywhere<\/b><\/i>. Bear in mind that the cost of living varies a lot by state, so a $15 minimum wage in Mississippi is would be like a $19.21 minimum wage in New York.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many students enroll in the workshop due to nervousness surrounding public speaking, but during the class, they learn what the root of this nervousness is, and how to use that to improve their performance in normal, daily interactions.<\/p> <p>Come prepared to step out of your comfort zone, make new friends and leave with a new set of public speaking strategies and skills.
