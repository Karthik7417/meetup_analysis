If anyone would like to make announcements or propose a discussion topic feel free to do so.<\/p> <p>For newcomers, read on:<\/p> <p>If you aren't already familiar with the wider EA movement, I'm glad to have reached your eyeballs! Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/228152072\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklyvdbgc","time":1456358400000,"updated":1456372519000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"380 Third Avenue ( between 27 & 28 streets)","name":"Tavern on Third","lon":-74.005974,"id":8126042,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434662054000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/fullscreen\/984371987\/\">&lt;\/a&gt;Hello Run Chuggers!

This is a place where people can freely and openly\u00a0kick back and share ideas, write code, and contribute towards the learning and development of AI. All are welcomed. All that is required an open mind, a tolerance and respect for new ideas, and the daring to try something new.\u00a0<\/p> <p>CUMC is one of the world's leading research centers in the world, attracting some of the world's best minds to engage in breath taking research. Yet, it seems like there isn't much cross fertilization of ideas over what could potential revolutionize how science, our economy or society will work; no talk of artificial intelligence. It is also strange that although New York is the second best place for technology companies in the country, not much attention has paid been to CUMC. This meetup presents a great opportunity to finally begin to address these issues in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am still working on the subject of this first meetup.\u00a0Given the nature of AI, I am leaning towards asking two question: \"What are the ethics of AI?\" and \"What are some current advancements in AI?\", then see where it goes from there.<\/p> <p>As always, if you have a suggestion leave it in\u00a0the discussion section.<\/p> <p>Thank you again for joining.<\/p> <p>Edit 2\/11\/2016:<br\/>Shout out to Leila who suggested that the first question should be:\u00a0\"Why your interest in AI?\".<\/p> <p>And so it shall be.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Inside the Word Up Bookstore","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AI-at-CUMC\/events\/228745208\/","yes_rsvp_count":38,"duration":5400000,"name":"1st AI @ CUMC meeting","id":"228745208","time":1456358400000,"updated":1456461058000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454302326000,"name":"AI @ Columbia University Medical Center","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":19480142,"urlname":"AI-at-CUMC","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"5035 Broadway","name":"Cavala Cafe","lon":-73.916542,"id":24386576,"state":"NY","lat":40.869717,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.13873577118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452701237000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Ladies,<br\/>We've had so many great events for growth so let's let our hair down, put our laptops away and meet each other for a glass of wine or beverage of your choice.<br\/>There are so many of you that need support but even more so an opportunity to let loose a bit and meet other amazing women.

Two common examples are in time-series work, where the data are not independent and dependencies need to be\u00a0modeled\u00a0explicitly, and in causal research, where consistent estimates of the parameters themselves are the primary object of interest. Jim will discuss the usefulness of the Random Forest's proximity matrix in this sort of work. He will present two new methods:\u00a0<\/p> <p>-\u00a0<b>Proximity matching:\u00a0<\/b>A technique for building synthetic control groups for causal analysis on observational data. This method largely overcomes both the dimensionality issues and Smith-Todd critique of other matching methods.<\/p> <p>-\u00a0<b>Analogy weighting:\u00a0<\/b>A method for constructing weights to use in time-series models. This weighting scheme allows researchers to give weight to relevant periods of history and ignore irrelevant periods. In doing so, it frees modelers from having to decide on a look-back window for estimation.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Jim:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jim Savage is Data Science Lead at <a href=\"http:\/\/lendable.io\/\">Lendable<\/a>, a frontier markets finance start-up.

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p. \u00a0<\/p> <p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10.<\/p> <p>For questions contact [masked] |[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>Can't make this one? \u00a0Visit us at www.turnonny.us<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8OWkv9zms4E\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8OWkv9zms4E<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OneTasteNewYork\/events\/228901933\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"duration":5400000,"name":"TurnON New York City","id":"kdlwjlyvdbgc","time":1456362000000,"updated":1456369307000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1251498220000,"name":"OneTaste New York","group_lon":-74,"id":1514451,"urlname":"OneTasteNewYork","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"70 Eckford St","name":"Eckford Street Studio","lon":-73.948082,"id":23839810,"lat":40.722153,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.92461848259,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436795491000,"fee":{"amount":17,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/0\/f\/600_439319407.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Want to get out of the house or studio and refresh your artistic skills or just enjoy figure drawing?

The hot glue and plasti-dip did not heat-up significantly. (after 2 minutes, the water was steaming)<\/p> <p>We concluded that Hot Glue and Plasti-dip do not absorb significant amounts of microwave energy. Unfortunately, Hot Glue still de-tunes the antenna, probably by way of a capacitive effect. The solution to this is probably to make the antenna more inductive. But how, by how much and how to determine when the ideal value is reached is still in question.<\/p> <p>Jesse also suggested (I assume jokingly) that we could all get into clover-leaf antenna building for fun and profit. Since he's got a 2-month backlog of antenna work, maybe that's a real possibility? He got several willing volunteers so maybe we'll find out how that worked out for him.<\/p> <p>Also, there was a lot of discussion of Twilight-Zone plots.\u00a0James discovered that one of the plots I brought up was an Outer Limits episode called \"<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nightmare_%281963_The_Outer_Limits%29\">Nightmare<\/a>\".<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wur16G_88VA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wur16G_88VA<\/a><\/p> <p>.and there was a question about our glowforge, which we expect to be delivered sometime in the July timeframe.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ysCaqh38JVQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ysCaqh38JVQ<\/a><\/p> <p>AFAIK: we're not going to push to get into the glowforge \"beta\" program and it's probably too late for that anyway.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFinally:<\/p> <p>We've been having some technical difficulties getting this meetup account paid for.

We'll do out best to cancel meetups on holidays and days the space won't be available but you should also double check before coming out.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0While there are snacks and drinks at the space, lunch is not provided. There are a number of restaurants, delis and other places to get food in the area so plan accordingly<\/p> <p>\u2022 These daily coworking events are self run. A co-organizer will not always be at the event. These events are designed to give game developers a free space to work so you'll basically be left alone at the space to do you own thing. We suggest reaching out to other attending through the comments to sit together or meet up at a specific time in the space.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLast thing, two times a month we'll have a dedicated space for you to come out and work as well as listen to talks and get help from myself and others in the community. Those will be different events you'll need to register for which are separate from the daily co-working space.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/228158610\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":28800000,"name":"Indie Coworking Space","id":"htvgmlyvdbhc","time":1456412400000,"updated":1456442591000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11222","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"lorimer street and driggs avenue","name":"McCarren Park","lon":-73.950623,"id":6158322,"state":"NY","lat":40.72171,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":32,"headcount":0,"distance":2.84666895866,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1424368686000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Four years of 10am Tuesday\/Thursday Football at Mc Carren park!<\/p> <p>Games start on time, please be there 10-15m before.<\/p> <p>No sliding tackles, no corners, no CLEATS, small goals 7v7 games.<\/p> <p><b>Bring a positive attitude and\u00a0a Dark and White shirt.<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nThe field is on <b>Driggs Ave &amp; Lorimer Street.<\/b>\u00a0Look for the field with the running track around it.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BklynPickupSoccer\/events\/228636816\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"duration":10800000,"name":"Thursday Morning Pick-Up McCarren Park 10 AM","id":"rhzqflyvdbhc","time":1456412400000,"updated":1456424357000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1241024348000,"name":"Brooklyn Pickup Soccer Group","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1446129,"urlname":"BklynPickupSoccer","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":6.94302940369,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456373959000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You need to REGISTER with the Englewood Parks &amp; Recreation Department at the following link: \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/registercommunitypass.net\/Englewood\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/registercommunitypass.net\/Englewood<\/a><\/p> <p>There, you will be able to pay the $40 fee online. \u00a0Please DO NOT PAY BELOW.<\/p> <p>This fee covers all 10 classes. \u00a0I hope you will attend ALL remaining 9!! \u00a0(There is no refund for missed classes.)<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCourse: \u00a0Fun Fingers<\/p> <p>Age Suggestion: \u00a02 1\/2 through 5<\/p> <p>Class 2: \u00a0Transfer Activities<\/p> <p>Review &amp; New: \u00a0Each week we will review the essentials of working in a classroom, such as how to sit with others for circle time, how to complete a \"work cycle\" from choosing an activity to returning it to its correct place, and how to work at a table or on the floor. \u00a0<\/p> <p>New this week will be traditional Montessori transfer activities.

It represents tremendous promise of using big data to transform business operations. Hadoop was developed as a solution for efficient and scalable search indexing need. The first version had MapReduce programming model. Mastering MapReduce required steep learning curve, and migrating applications to MapReduce needed a complete re-write. This along with the requirement of moving compute closer to data made MapReduce an impediment that did little to bolster productization of big data. There are faster in-memory substitutes to MapReduce, but they too carry the same baggage. In hindsight, Hadoop should have modeled itself as a distributed operating system, and enabled various programming models to run. Hadoop 2.0 (Yarn) was the answer. Not only does Yarn allow organizations to perform advanced analytics with data at unprecedented volume, but it\u2019s also broadened the use cases for Big Data across the industry segments.What is now needed is bleeding edge Yarn-based platform capable of radically realizing Hadoop\u2019s potential.These new age big data platforms must deliver real business value of the Big Data. This means easy deployment, ease of \u00a0integration with existing IT infrastructure, ease of migration and development of applications to Hadoop, and faster time to insight for business.The key requirements of this new platforms should reside in:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Simplicity and Production-ready<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Code Reuse<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Operability<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ease of integration<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Leveraging the power of Hadoop\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>In this webinar we will discuss Apache Apex (incubating), the next generation native Hadoop big data platform.

Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston.

In the middle of the Internet revolution, iCouldBe developed one of the earliest e-mentoring platforms designed to bring the power of mentoring to at-risk youth across the US. With 1.2 million youth dropping out of school each year, 16 million students in need of a mentor and high school students only receiving 10 minutes per year of guidance counseling, the US continues to face an educational crisis.<\/p> <p>Since 2000, iCouldBe\u2019s e-mentoring program has served over 21,000 at-risk middle and high school students, empowering teens to stay in school, plan for future careers, and achieve in life. Students from public high schools across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, select their own mentors and work on e-mentoring activities that focus on academic success strategies, career exploration, and post-secondary educational and career planning.<\/p> <p>After attending a DataDive, iCouldBe began working with a team of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.datakind.org\/blog\/datacorps-teams-kicking-off\/\">DataCorps volunteers<\/a> (Thomas Vincent, Peter Fleischman, Pooja Madan, and Matt Yin) to analyze their 15 years worth of data, including 130,000 anonymous mentor-mentee conversations, to understand how to define successful mentorship interactions.<\/p> <p>Hear from Wendy Siegelman, iCouldBe\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, on how this work will help the organization better serve students in need of mentoring and to keep more students in school. Then, ask your own questions during a facilitated Q&amp;A.<\/p> <p>AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T Aspire, the company\u2019s signature philanthropic initiative, support both DataKind and iCouldBe, so we are especially thankful that they are sponsoring this Meetup and providing the perfect space for a DataKind family reunion.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 7 and 15 mini dates each lasting between four and eight minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>Get Your Tickets At: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-40s-50s.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-40s-50s.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-40s-50s.html<\/a><\/a><\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>* There is a one drink minimum at the event.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost.

This Winter Masquerade will be held from 7 to 10 p.m. and will feature an open bar, Tuscan hors d'oeuvres, dancing, and an exclusive view of one of the most wonderful private art collections in New York, gracing the many rooms of the Club.

But, if you happen to meet the love of your life at Vegan Drinks, don't forget to invite us to the wedding!<\/p> <p>-- What to do?<br\/>Be friendly! We'll be passing out nametags, so you can march right up to someone and greet them by name.<br\/>Promote! If you're representing an organization (either as an employee or volunteer or general supporter), talk up the organization and the work you've been involved in. If you're representing you, talk up your vegan and AR interests, your favorite restaurant, your dream job for animals, your blog, etc., etc.<br\/>Make a shout out! Starting around 8:30pm, we'll turn down the music and encourage people to promote themselves, their groups and\/or causes for 30 seconds. If you represent a veg*n or animal rights group, come prepared with your spiel and literature!<br\/>Sip a drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic, we don't care!) and relax with like-minded folks for a couple of hours.<\/p> <p>What to bring?<br\/>Business cards<br\/>Pamphlets promoting your organization<br\/>Tip money for the cute bartenders<br\/>Your A-game<br\/>Vegan Drinks takes place the last Thursday of the month (usually; check the date to be sure!) from 7pm to 10pm.

Radio - Kingdom Girl's, Talk Show Host, Roxanne Brown-Robinson interviews Christian Song Artist, Myra Graham Quince on \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Purpose\".<\/p> <p>Date: February 25, 2016 at 7 PM Eastern Standard Time<\/p> <p>Call in to speak with the guest @ (646)[masked]<\/p> <p>Short Bio: Myra Graham Quince<\/p> <p>Psalmist, Radio personality, and Writer Elder Myra Graham Quince of Latta, SC currently resides in Wilmington, NC with her husband Elder Kenneth Quince Jr. From an early age God called her to be a Psalmist which was recognized by her mother who gave her the nickname \u201cSong Bird\u201d. Myra began to develop her gifts as a Praise and Worship Leader at her Father's Ministry New Memorial Temple of Christ at age of 14. With the foundation set, God began to reveal to Myra not only the power of her voice but her ability to deliver the word of God providing deliverance to many. In Myra\u2019s obedience to God many other opportunities have opened such as acting. In 2012 Myra was cast as one of the Church ladies in the Screenplay \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d. With her ability to harmonize and project the door opened for her dream role as Effie in the 2013 Screenplay \u201cDream Girls\u201d. Following these two projects in August of 2013 Myra released her first single \u201cPsalm 91\u201d followed by her Christmas rendition of \u201cOh Holy Night\u201d. In 2014 Myra\u2019s ministry began to blossom even more showing her that God wasn\u2019t finished yet.<\/p> <p>In early 2015 God began speak to Myra concerning a new ministry project. In this time of God speaking and tugging on her heart \"You Made Me New\"was developed. A powerful delivering message to the people of God that God is able to make ALL things new. The development of this EP happened so swiftly but came out to perfection because it was in the glorification of God, to edify his people, and to build the Kingdom. Since the releasing of this EP \"You Made Me New\", God has continued to show up and show out for Myra, and He is not finished yet!<\/p> <p>In October 2015 Myra join Gospel Joy 1490am WWIL, IN Wilmington,NC as an host on the Gospel Train which airs every Sunday morning.<\/p> <p>In December 2015, Myra became the worship leader at Freedom\u2019s Way Ministries, in Wilmington, NC. This is only the beginning. Myra Graham Quince can often be heard saying: \"the timing of God is absolute, and His favor is remarkable\".<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Break-Every-Chain-Womens-Empowerment-Seminar\/events\/229100127\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Kingdom Girl's Roxanne Brown-Robinson interviews Myra Graham Quince","id":"229100127","time":1456444800000,"updated":1456457142000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455154040000,"name":"\"Break Every Chain\" Women's Empowerment Seminar","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":19552513,"urlname":"Break-Every-Chain-Womens-Empowerment-Seminar","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Kingdom Minded Women"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newark","address_1":"47 Halsey Street","name":"Burger Walla","lon":-74.171341,"id":23582797,"state":"NJ","lat":40.740883,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.53284645081,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456246817000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>At some point, everyone wants to get away...to travel, see' new things, meet new people, get to know a new side of YOU.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nWith GET AWAY as the theme,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/evolutionopenmic\">#EvolutionOpenMic<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0will touch on that, with the help of the night's\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/ascendedartists\">#AscendedArtists<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0who know thing or two about traveling: The Bi-lingual hip hop duo,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NegrosAmericanos\/\">Negros Americanos<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mcenigmalyle\">Mcenigma Lyle<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NappyBishop\">Jordan Fields<\/a>\u00a0)<\/p> <p>\n\nSHOWTIME: 7PM to 9PM\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n*List opens for sign ups at 6:30PM--- 20 SLOTS ONLY!!!<\/p> <p>\n\n* one piece limit for poets, singers, and emcees. 5 minutes for other performers.<\/p> <p>\n\nKween Moore of Urban Kween Brand will present the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/canvasofresource\">#CanvasOfResource<\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0for us to fill up with our musings through paint.<\/p> <p>\n\n* $5 cover plus donations<\/p> <p>\n\n.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>ABOUT THE SHOW:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nEVOLUTION is about pushing through the comfort zone and into the unknown, for individuals must go beyond remedial to truly say they are grown.

The most powerful advisor to Louis XIV was more fascinated by art than theology, and although Bernini in Paris would ultimately be the prize of Mazarin's successor, the Cardinal imported innumerable Italian compositions and a fair number of Italian composers to his adopted country. His dedication to artistic splendor was a hallmark of his tenure and a gift to subsequent generations.<\/p> <p>Native sons whom he championed include Luigi Rossi (1597 \u2013 1653), whose Orfeo was one of the first operas to be staged in France, Virgilio Mazzocchi (1597 \u2013 1646), and Giacomo Carissimi (1605 \u2013 1674), who became the teacher of Charpentier. Their music, mostly Roman, and mostly born of the decadent Barberini papal court, came to transform the course of French music. Arias, cantatas, and operas by these Italian composers and more can be found to this day at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de Paris, where many treasures of Mazarin\u2019s collection still await a performance in our own time.<\/p> <p>A wine and cheese reception follows the concert.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/6\/6\/600_446592902.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/italianiallestero-TV\/events\/228666153\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"name":"Roman baroque music followed by a wine and cheese reception","id":"228666153","time":1456448400000,"updated":1456460257000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1108961524000,"name":"ITALIANI NYc  italian language  www.ITALIANIALLESTERO.TV","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":196664,"urlname":"italianiallestero-TV","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Italians italiani all'estero"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"137 W 14th St, New York, NY 10011","name":"Bunga's Den ","lon":-73.998367,"id":24361905,"state":"NY","lat":40.7383,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.921302199364,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456320710000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us to see some of the hottest comics in NYC, many have been seen at the top clubs and on a variety of TV shows. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>The show is free and there is going to be $1 Raffle Tickets for a FREE READING with a very talented psychic who's made TV appearances!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We'll be in the back room of the Bunga Den. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>There is a 1 drink (alcohol or non-alcohol) minimum.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Events-NYC\/events\/229094418\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Live Comedy Show-Free Admission!","id":"229094418","time":1456448400000,"updated":1456479087000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430847798000,"name":"! \"Free Events\" !","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18577622,"urlname":"Free-Events-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"137 West 14th Street","name":"Bunga's Den","lon":-73.998405,"id":10793692,"state":"NY","lat":40.73827,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.924197733402,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454740066000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/7\/5\/600_447188309.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We have some of the hottest comics in NYC, many have been seen at the top clubs and on a variety of TV shows.

What kind of world results when the Dark Lord is in charge? The answer will be found in the Mistborn Trilogy, a saga of surprises and magical martial-arts action that begins in Mistborn . For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. Readers of Elantris thought they'd discovered someone special in Brandon Sanderson. Mistborn proves they were right.\u00a0<\/p> <p>(Joe Cirillo recommendation)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-fiction-society-northern-nj\/events\/225802746\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Modern Masters:  Mistborn:  The Final Empire by Brian Sanderson","id":"jxvfllyvdbhc","time":1456448400000,"updated":1456460201000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1233007408000,"name":"The Science Fiction Society of Northern New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1367789,"urlname":"science-fiction-society-northern-nj","group_lat":41.0699996948,"who":"SF\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"406 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"OneTaste New York","lon":-74.002022,"id":23696708,"state":"NY","lat":40.718777,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.25189709663,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456263742000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are women who OM (OM stands for Orgasmic Meditation, go to onetaste.us to learn more), and we want to tell you our stories. Charged. Vulnerable. Heated. Curious. Electric.<\/p> <p>What happened throughout our lives - how we felt the timbres of our bones shaking and that undeniable yearning to know ourselves in this world more deeply. To push ourselves further, to love ourselves more; to live what we now know to be an Orgasmic Life. Orgasm. Power. Connection. Sex. Desire. Purpose.<\/p> <p>We were touched by something wordless and visceral, impossible to explain, but harder to avoid. We argued with everything we\u2019d ever been told about how our bodies should look, how much happiness we were allowed, how our relationships were supposed to go; we worked with our minds just enough to get bodies on the mat to feel that first stroke. And from that moment, everything changed. That smallest whisper that started out as \u201cdespite the fear, i want this\u201d became \u201ci can have it, because it\u2019s my birthright\u201d. That is how we live our lives; on the edge of believing, beyond what 99% of the what the world thinks is possible in the realm of sexuality, spirituality, business and relationship.

The most powerful advisor to Louis XIV was more fascinated by art than theology, and although Bernini in Paris would ultimately be the prize of Mazarin's successor, the Cardinal imported innumerable Italian compositions and a fair number of Italian composers to his adopted country. His dedication to artistic splendor was a hallmark of his tenure and a gift to subsequent generations.<\/p> <p>Native sons whom he championed include Luigi Rossi (1597 \u2013 1653), whose Orfeo was one of the first operas to be staged in France, Virgilio Mazzocchi (1597 \u2013 1646), and Giacomo Carissimi (1605 \u2013 1674), who became the teacher of Charpentier. Their music, mostly Roman, and mostly born of the decadent Barberini papal court, came to transform the course of French music. Arias, cantatas, and operas by these Italian composers and more can be found to this day at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de Paris, where many treasures of Mazarin\u2019s collection still await a performance in our own time.<\/p> <p>A wine and cheese reception follows the concert.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salon-Sanctuary-Concerts\/events\/228665214\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"At the Pleasure of Mazarin: Roman Treasures from Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de Paris","id":"228665214","time":1456448400000,"updated":1456460256000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335380192000,"name":"Music Meetups","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":3740742,"urlname":"Salon-Sanctuary-Concerts","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"675 Hudson St b\/t 13th St & 14 St  Meatpacking District","name":"Troy Liquor Bar (Meatpacking District)","lon":-74.005318,"id":24381417,"state":"NY","lat":40.740025,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.05960035324,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456103021000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/c\/8\/600_447109096.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0You\u2019re invited to be our guest at\u00a0our Thursday Get Together\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thursday,\u00a0February 25, 2016\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0TROY\u00a0<br\/>675 HUDSON ST b\/t 13th &amp; 14th street | MEATPACKING DISTRICT| NYC<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PARTY STARTS AT 8PM |\u00a0EVERYONE FREE ALL NIGHT |\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Do mention Rory\u2019s List to the door person!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dress code is Business Casual<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We look forward in seeing you there.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 Call\/ text the organizer if you have further questions\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cheers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rory<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/f\/1\/600_447109137.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Mention Rory's List to the door person","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/INTERNATIONAL-singles-newyork\/events\/229029745\/","yes_rsvp_count":74,"name":"Thursday Get Together @ Troy Meatpacking District!

Capital One has embraced this new generation of technology with open arms. However, \u201cThere ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d<\/p> <p>For many years, there\u2019s been a very real battle around the standard operating model of software. Tech giants like Oracle and IBM have traditionally built massively expensive enterprise-ready products, while the open source community provides free, albeit usually inferior, software. For a product to be enterprise-ready, it must guarantee complete reliability alongside performance and flexibility. We had not yet seen open source succeed in the realm of distributed stream computing.<\/p> <p>Capital One set out to find whether we could build or find enterprise-ready technology in the open source world to tackle difficult streaming problems that also provides equivalent performance, durability, and availability as a mainframe computer. Ilya Ganelin details Capital One\u2019s attempt to answer this question in a rigorous and complete way, not just by making a prototype or discovering exciting new tools, but by creating an open source-based, enterprise-ready product that can transparently replace an enormously expensive proprietary solution. Ilya presents Capital One\u2019s novel solution for real-time decisioning on Apache Apex.<\/p> <p>Topics include:<\/p> <p>- A detailed dive into the business requirements of a new real-time decisioning platform for model building, feature computation, and model scoring.<\/p> <p>- A survey and analysis of the leading open source technologies for stream processing and what tradeoffs Capital One considered when selecting their technology stack.<\/p> <p>- Capital One\u2019s solution, based on Apache Apex, which provides unparalleled performance on Hadoop and meets the stringent performance, scalability, and durability requirements necessary for enterprise-grade decision making<\/p> <p>Bio:\u00a0<b>Ilya Ganelin<\/b>\u00a0is a roboticist turned data engineer. After a few years building self-discovering robots at the University of Michigan and another few years working on embedded DSP software with cell phones and radios at Boeing, he landed in the world of big data at the Capital One Data Innovation Lab. Ilya is an active contributor to the core components of Apache Spark and a committer to Apache Apex with the goal of learning what it takes to build a next-generation distributed computing platform. Ilya is an avid bread maker, cook, skier, and race-car driver.<\/p> <p>Abstract -\u00a0<b>Integrating Apex and Apache NiFi<\/b><\/p> <p>In this talk we will give an overview of Apache NiFi and how it can be used to bring data to an analytic platform like Apache Apex. Specifically we\u2019ll discuss the details of the NiFi input and output operators that were developed for the Apache Apex Malhar library, and talk through use-cases for integrating the two technologies.<\/p> <p>Bio:\u00a0<b>Bryan Bende<\/b>\u00a0is a Member of the Technical Staff at Hortonworks where he develops dataflow capabilities around the core framework of Apache NiFi, and has over ten years of experience developing enterprise software solutions.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713437\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713437","time":1456527600000,"updated":1456533053000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11238","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"857 Atlantic Ave","name":"Social Butterfly","lon":-73.965103,"id":2995571,"state":"NY","lat":40.681396,"repinned":false},"headcount":32,"distance":4.92627334595,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455255520000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Steppin' Friday at the Social Butterfly in Brooklyn<\/b><\/p> <p>Friday, February 26, 2016<\/p> <p>Start your weekend off with the Empire Steppers<\/p> <p>We had a great time at the grand opening of Steppin' Friday.

Kaplan will draw from her experience as a Space Research Specialist to discuss the tasks and challenges of preparing astronauts for spaceflight, while Neilson will present her Menu for Mars Supper Club project, which envisions the future of cuisine on Mars.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Setting Out<\/i> explores how the nature of expeditions has evolved into the modern day. Incorporating the work of archaeologists, engineers, scientists, and artists exploring a variety of realms both geographical and beyond, the exhibition demonstrates that all these expeditions share the same eager hunger to uncover the unknown.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Janna Kaplan<\/b>, M.S., is Lecturer in Psychology and Senior Research Associate at Brandeis University\u2019s Graybiel Lab, specializing in Neuropsychology and Space Research. At Brandeis since 1983, she studies human adaptation to various conditions of space flight, such as zero-G, high-G, artificial gravity environments, spatial orientation, and space motion sickness. Within the Graybiel Lab, Kaplan has developed a program initiating commercial and private payload and research of astronaut training, of which she is now Program Lead and Senior Scientist. The training protocol focuses on sensorimotor human factors of flight, such as space motion sickness, spatial disorientation, spatial illusions, and movement errors in changing gravitoinertial force environments. Kaplan serves on Faculty Advisory Councils of the Brandeis-Genesis Institute for Russian Jewry, and of the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute for the Study of Jewish Women. She frequently lectures on the science of space exploration. Of special interest to her is the role of STEM curriculum (science, technology, engineering, math) in the empowerment and intellectual development of adolescent girls.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Heidi Neilson<\/b> is an artist addressing topics such as weather, fake snow, and the cultural landscape of outer space. Her work is often collaborative and publishing-based. She is a member of the ABC Artists\u2019 Books Cooperative, co-founded SP Weather Station, and her work is included in over 60 museum and university collections. Born in Oregon, Heidi received a BA in biology from Reed College and an MFA in painting from Pratt Institute, and lives and works in New York.<\/p> <p>\n\nPlease join us for this free and open to the public apexart <a href=\"http:\/\/apexart.org\/events.php\">event<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>apexart<\/b>'s exhibitions and and public programs are supported in part by the Affirmation Arts Fund, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Edith C.

Indeed, the film devotes as much time to humor as it does to scares and shocks.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/motel-hell-v33403\">Motel Hell<\/a>\u00a0pokes fun at such diverse targets as televangelism, swingers, and good old-fashioned American capitalism as it chronicles Farmer Vincent's grisly doings. This script is ably supported by subtle, atmospheric direction by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/kevin-connor-p85704\">Kevin Connor<\/a>, who captures the script's complex blend of humor and horror nicely and also works in some clever visual references to horror classics like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/night-of-the-living-dead-v35311\">Night of the Living Dead<\/a>.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/motel-hell-v33403\">Motel Hell<\/a>\u00a0also benefits from above-average performances. The obvious scene-stealer is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/rory-calhoun-p83867\">Rory Calhoun<\/a>, who fuels the quietly deranged Farmer Vincent with enough compassion and down-home charm to make him likable despite his villainous ways. His work is supported by a nice range of supporting performances, including slyly comic turns from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/nancy-parsons-p55241\">Nancy Parsons<\/a>\u00a0as Farmer Vincent's childlike but deadly partner in crime and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/paul-linke-p42575\">Paul Linke<\/a>\u00a0as his dim but determined younger brother. On the downside,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/motel-hell-v33403\">Motel Hell<\/a>'s leisurely pacing and emphasis on characterization might throw off horror fans weaned on hard-driving fare like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/re-animator-v40416\">Re-Animator<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/the-evil-dead-v16251\">The Evil Dead<\/a>. However, even viewers turned off by these aspects will want to stick around for the film's bravura finale, which involves a chainsaw duel and a hero swinging to the rescue on a meat hook. In the end,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/motel-hell-v33403\">Motel Hell<\/a>\u00a0is probably a bit too eccentric and grisly for the average viewer, but its solidly crafted blend of wit and gore makes it a natural for cult film fanatics and horror addicts with a sense of humor.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k4AR3BgaCdA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k4AR3BgaCdA<\/a><\/p> <p>You can buy tickets here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/drafthouse.com\/greater-ny\/show\/prints-of-darkness-motel-hell\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/drafthouse.com\/greater-ny\/show\/prints-of-darkness-motel-hell<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/228873248\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Motel Hell 35mm film print movie starts at 10pm","id":"228873248","time":1456540200000,"updated":1456693354000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10029","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Tito Puente Education Complex 240 East 109th Street.

From there we'll drive together to the trail head at the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center.<\/p> <p>The hike will be challenging: up to 8 miles up and down or more, with some views of Manhattan. The hike is not easy, but if you're physically fit and prepared for the hike, you should be able to make it. In that sense, beginners are welcome.<\/p> <p>You have to be prepared for the hike - it may be cold, rainy, snowy. You have to have boots that don't get wet easily. Bring layers of clothes so that you can add and remove a layer as necessary. The clothes should be synthetic (cotton does not dry when it gets wet from your sweat). Don't forget to bring a rain jacket, gloves and a hat. You also have to have at least a 1.5 liter of water and a lunch snack.<\/p> <p>As usual, we'll be carpooling. Please sign up on the waiting list and I'll move you to the yes column as we get more drivers signed up. Also please bring some cash with you to give to your driver to pay the gas and tolls.<\/p> <p>If you have a question, post it below or e-mail me. I'll send a spreadsheet to organize the carpool on the Wednesday before the hike.<\/p> <p>Driving Directions<\/p> <p>Take N.J. Route 17 north to the New York State Thruway and take the first exit, Exit 15A (Sloatsburg). Turn left at the bottom of the ramp onto N.Y. Route 17 north, and continue through the Village of Sloatsburg. Just past the village, turn right at the traffic light, following the sign for Harriman State Park. Cross an overpass over railroad tracks and continue along Seven Lakes Drive for three-quarters of a mile to the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center, on the right side of the road.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods programs to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/228537753\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"228537753","time":1456580700000,"updated":1456594441000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":5,"distance":12.3002853394,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454876663000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Overview<br\/>NOTE. Go all the way to the very end of Rider Hollow Rd to DEC parking area.<br\/>This loop hike climbs to the summit of Balsam Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Catskills. This hike is not for beginners.<\/p> <p><br\/>Details<\/p> <p>Time: 5 hours<br\/>Difficulty: Strenuous<br\/>Length: 5.5 mils<br\/>Dogs: Allowed off leash<\/p> <p>Carpooling: post on site if you want to carpool<\/p> <p><br\/>Directions\/ Trailhead GPS Coordinates[masked],[masked]<\/p> <p>Take the New York State Thruway to Exit 19 (Kingston) and proceed west on Route 28 (following the signs to \"Pine Hill\"). Continue along Route 28 for about 35 miles. After passing through the Village of Pine Hill, you'll climb a rather steep hill and reach Highmount. At the top of the hill, follow signs for the Belleayre Ski Area and turn left onto Galli Curci Road, passing the entrances to the ski area on the left. Continue ahead for 4.9 miles from Route 28 (along the way, the name of the road changes to Todd Mountain Road). At the base of a long descent, turn left onto Rider Hollow Road, and proceed for about 2.5 miles to the parking area at the end of the road.<\/p> <p><br\/>Description<\/p> <p>Balsam Mountain is one of the 35 peaks in the Catskill Mountains that is over 3,500 feet in elevation. During the winter, it makes an ideal snowshoe hike under appropriate conditions. Trail conditions in the Catskills constantly change - especially in the winter - bring snowshoes\/traction devices.<\/p> <p>From the parking area, proceed ahead on the red-blazed Oliverea-Mapledale Trail, soon crossing a stream on a wood-and-steel bridge. A short distance beyond, the trail bears left and climbs higher on the hillside to avoid a trail section destroyed during Hurricane Irene in August 2011. In a third of a mile, the yellow-blazed Mine Hollow Trail begins on the left. The Mine Hollow Trail will be your return route, but for now, proceed ahead on the Oliverea-Mapledale Trail, which descends to recross the stream on a truss bridge. Beyond the lean-to, the trail recrosses the stream (and tributaries) four more times. After the fourth stream crossing, the trail begins to climb rather steeply, gaining about 750 feet in elevation over the next 0.8 mile. This is the most challenging portion of the hike. About 1.75 miles from the start, after a short level stretch, you'll reach a junction with the blue-blazed Pine Hill-West Branch Trail. Turn left and follow this blue-blazed trail for another 0.8 mile. Although you'll continue to climb, the grade is more moderate.<\/p> <p>After a steep climb up a rock face, the trail becomes nearly level. Soon, you'll reach the highest point on the hike - the summit of Balsam Mountain. The summit elevation is 3,600 feet above sea level, and you've climbed about 1,600 feet to reach this point. No sign identifies the summit, but you can tell when you reach it as the trail begins to descend a little.<\/p> <p>Continue along the trail for another 1,000 feet to a panoramic viewpoint to the right which overlooks the hamlet of Big Indian below. You'll want to take a break here to rest from your arduous ascent of this mountain.<\/p> <p>Beyond the very steep section, the trail levels off and then climbs a little. Soon, you'll come to a junction with the yellow-blazed Mine Hollow Trail, which begins on the left. Turn left and follow this trail, which continues downhill. In half a mile, it makes a sharp right turn in a hemlock grove and continues to descend along a stream.<\/p> <p>A mile from its start, the Mine Hollow Trail ends at a junction with the red-blazed Oliverea-Mapledale Trail. Bear right and follow this red-blazed trail for a third of a mile back to the parking area where the hike began.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/adventurers-237\/events\/228686364\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Balsam Mountain Catskill High Peak","id":"228686364","time":1456580700000,"updated":1456623411000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1205020409000,"name":"NJ\/NY Hiking, Cycling and Kayaking","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1052584,"urlname":"adventurers-237","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Adventurerists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Locust","address_1":"300 Navesink Avenue","name":"Hartshorne Woods Park (Buttermilk Valley Entrance)","lon":-74.014847,"id":17519412,"state":"NJ","lat":40.403873,"repinned":false},"headcount":15,"distance":23.9996738434,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456102861000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Its time for a Hartshorne Park Hike - where 200 foot plus hills and the Jersey shore come together!

His breakthrough works of channeled literature, <i>I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation, The Book of Knowing and Worth<\/i> and <i>The Book of Mastery<\/i> have quickly become the most important and celebrated expression of channeling since A Course in Miracles rose to prominence in the 1970s.

The conference brings together feminist scholars, activists, artists and community members from various constituencies to address the obstacles we face -- including biomedical models of health and wellness; anti-black police and state violence; and the far-reaching tentacles of neoliberalism shrinking public resources and expanding the prison industrial complex. Panelists will address the creative and courageous responses they have developed to sustain their work as activists, scholars and visionaries working toward housing justice, ending poverty and incarceration, and building feminist knowledge production as theory, research, teaching, and praxis. Visionary activist and thinker Reina Gossett will be the keynote speaker.
