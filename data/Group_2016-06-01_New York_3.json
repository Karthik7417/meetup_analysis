This group offers simple down-to-earth guided meditations designed to connect with deeper parts of oneself and one&rsquo;s own experience of the sacred.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>We use the book &ldquo;Silo&rsquo;s Message&rdquo; to guide our meetings. Silo is a spiritual guide who is also well-known for developing Universalist Humanism.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Our purpose is to create an environment that will nurture and foster deep experiences and help us notice them and live them in our daily life.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Our meetings are small and community oriented so that everyone can interact easily and comfortably. And they are always open &ndash; no commitment or experience is required. Complete beginners are welcome.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Each meeting is divided into two parts: the first is dedicated to discussion and interchange from Silo's Message and the second part to internal experience. We work with guided experiences that focus on Well-Being for ourselves and others and an experience which is focused on quieting the mind and awakening the internal energy, known as the Force.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>This is not a religious organization and we welcome and respect people of all backgrounds and beliefs. We work entirely on a volunteer basis. There are no costs for the meeting.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Occasionally we have day long seminars at the Hudson Valley Park of Study and Reflection (see our sister meetup group http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Nature-Meetup-Day-trips-out-of-NYC\/). The Park is a beautiful retreat center located 2 hours from New York City which is part of the world-wide network of parks inspired by Silo&rsquo;s work. http:\/\/www.hudsonvalleypark.org\/\n<br \/>\n<br \/>For information about Silo and his life:\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Biography: http:\/\/silosmessage.net\/about_silo.asp?LANG=EN\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Description of Silo&rsquo;s life work: http:\/\/newhumanist.us\/?p=1211<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/highres_23038298.jpeg","photo_id":23038298,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/600_23038298.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/b\/a\/thumb_23038298.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13481406,"name":"Nicole Myers","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/9\/5\/highres_11993909.jpeg","photo_id":11993909,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/9\/5\/member_11993909.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/9\/5\/thumb_11993909.jpeg"}},"members":458,"name":"New York Meditation group Union Square based on The Message","id":1783897,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-group-Union-Square-based-on-The-Message","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Chatham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1297758799000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"attachmentparenting","name":"Attachment Parenting","id":1621},{"urlkey":"mothersrights","name":"Mothers' Rights","id":9988},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"breastfeeding","name":"Breastfeeding","id":15534},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"baby-wearing","name":"Babywearing","id":17535},{"urlkey":"natural-parenting","name":"Natural Parenting","id":23428},{"urlkey":"postpartum-depression","name":"Postpartum Depression","id":38322},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"being-present-with-your-baby","name":"Being \"present\" with your baby","id":156148},{"urlkey":"letting-go-of-control-and-perfectionism","name":"Letting go of control and perfectionism","id":156149}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/the-mothers-club\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>Our moms groups are legendary!

Thoughts about difficult situations and past events can trigger negative emotions that keep us stuck. EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUES (EFT), which is based on the emerging field of Energy Psychology, can quickly and effectively address any kind of negative emotion that keeps you from enjoying a greater life experience. In EFT, you learn to tap on specific body trigger points to correct the energy disruptions that cause unwanted emotions (like using psychological acupuncture). Come learn this easy and effective approach to self healing and together we\u2019ll tap our way to more emotional freedom and well being.<\/p>\n<p>The facilitator for these meetings is Steven Gottlieb, a personal performance and empowerment coach and a specialist in the emerging fields of Energy Psychology and Energy Medicine.

It was founded in 1985 by investor Victor Niederhoffer, who hosts each meeting. More info on the NYC is available at NYCJunto.org. More info on Niederhoffer is available at his website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.DailySpeculations.com\">DailySpeculations<\/a>. Niederhoffer tweets at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VicNiederhoffer\">twitter.com\/VicNiederhoffer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The NYC Junto is inspired by the Junto hosted by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia from 1727 to 1757. Like Franklin, we bring together intelligent people to discuss intellectual issues in a respectful manner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our meetings are always held at the Mechanics Institute at at 20 W 44th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues&nbsp;in Manhattan on the first Thursday of each month.<\/strong> We usually have a guest speaker who can bring new insights and ideas to us. Debate and questions are encouraged. Admission is free. No donation is requested. There is no connection with any political party or religious organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why I started the group:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I read in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography that the most valuable thing he ever did in his life was to have a series of meetings with a dozen of his friends where they would try to make contributions to natural philosophy as well as their individual welfare.<\/p>\n<p>I always had tremendous respect for Doug Casey of the Eris group and I tried to model a group halfway between the Eris Society and the kind of group that Benjamin Franklin had. I invited people interested in free markets and the idea was to have one paper from the point of view of liberty to give us something hard to bite into and then discuss it and have a lot of feedback. And it has spontaneously grown.<\/p>\n<p>We have it once a month, almost always on the first Thursday. It used to be at my office in New York until they chased me out of New York with their excessive taxation.<\/p>\n<p>We started out by trying a few different formats but we coalesced on a format that works. We have about an hour where members unload various things about liberty in the news that they have a particular insight into. Then we have an invited speaker who talks about his own work on the forefront of individualism or liberty, and then we have a very animated discussion and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In our group, we have experts on almost every subject. The speakers always tell us that it's one of the most dynamic experiences for them. People write to me from all over the U.S. that they love my Junto, that it is one of the highlights of their life, that they hate to move out of New York, and that they will never be able to find anything like it.<\/p>\n<p>I finance it and pay for the speakers.<\/p>\n<p>Almost every major free market and individualist speaker has spoken at our group, and it has been going for almost 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>All are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Victor Niederhoffer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/highres_435168395.jpeg","photo_id":435168395,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/600_435168395.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/0\/b\/thumb_435168395.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14143271,"name":"Victor Niederhoffer","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/0\/highres_242396432.jpeg","photo_id":242396432,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/0\/member_242396432.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/0\/thumb_242396432.jpeg"}},"members":345,"name":"NYC Junto","id":1791553,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYCJunto","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"members of NYC Junto"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1299007736000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/be-happy-JC\/","rating":4.74,"description":"<p>Come home to the \"Art of Living\" Jersey City Happiness Group!\u00a0We are\u00a0dedicated to empowering you to live life to it's fullest potential through Breathing, Meditation &amp; Knowledge. \u00a0Come learn simple, yet profound ways to live a peaceful, happy, and healthy life.

I like to be out in the fresh air and get together with friends and enjoy the sites and smells of the woods. I have found it difficult to find people that are interested in mini week-end camp trips and that is alot of what my job enables me to be able to do, so I decided to start my own meet-up group...lets go camping and get out of the city!<br>\n\nWelcome everyone! I work hard to ensure that there are different activities at each camping trip that you can choose to visit. Come out and have some fun, I am really excited about this camping season! You can choose to do as many or as few activities as you like.<br>\n\nI plan local camping trips that are within 1-2 hours of New Rochelle\/Bronx area and as I spend alot of time researching for the lowest cost campgrounds and\/or getting us discount group rates you will be able to save money! And I make sure that there are activities in the area! Note, although I appreciate that everyone has their favorite sites camp grounds...it is next to impossible to get more than two people to sign up for a campground that is more than 1 and 1\/2 hours away from New Rochelle New York...so I almost never post any that are further than that driving range.<br>\n\nIf you bring an item YOU should be able to assemble and disassemble anything you bring with NO help! \u2013if you can\u2019t please be considerate and CALL me WAY in advance and lets practice together for the ease of everyone\u2014camping should be easy and relaxing NOT WORK! If you aren\u2019t sitting down within 30 minutes of arrival you have forgotten the most important camping information: LESS IS MORE\u2026You will enjoy the experience MORE if you have LESS!<br>\n\nAll New Members are required to post an actual current picture of themselves, which is clearly identifiable for safety reasons. A picture that is far away, your face is hidden by a tree, helmet etc will not be accepted. You will not be accepted to the group with a picture that I can't recognize you when you walk into camp...and if your picture changes before I know you really well then you will be removed from group for the safety of all members.<br>\n\nAll members must have a current paypal account, I do not accept cash payments, as I do not want cash at the site, and frankly once I get to the site I am there to relax not deal with who has paid and who hasn't. You must pay the nominal fee to sign up for an event. It unfortunately costs money to keep this site up and running and as I do not charge members monthly or annual membership fees...I have to charge a bit to off set the cost of keeping our site up so we get to keep our pictures and a way to stay in touch..please do note that I do my best to keep costs down!<br>\n\nIt is the members responsibility to READ the write up about each camping trip and to book their own site and bring all their own food and beverage! Occasionally we get group sites which is clearly listed in the write up...so be sure to read...if you ask a question that is already in the write up...I will just tell you to \"refer to the write up!\" lol please it is a lot of work so save me some energy and time and just take your time to read the write up about each event.<br>\n\n.. everyone can do all their cooking at the base camping site that I will always post the number so we can spend time together and enjoy each others company. That does not mean we cook for you or supply food...you have to bring stoves, pots dishes etc...<br>\n\nNote that YOU are responsible for cleaning up anything you use. You make a mess you clean the mess, take something out, then put it back when you are done, so the next person can use it.<br>\n\n..if you cook it you clean it...lets keep it easy...<br>\n\nYOU must provide your own chairs to sit in.---Do NOT sit in other MEMBERS chairs please use common sense if you want a more comfortable chair --Bring one with!!<br>\n\nPets: although this group LOVES pets it is a camping group and multiple animals often have issues together..just because your dog\/cat\/rabbit\/turtle\/bird is gentle and never causes problems does not mean that someone else's pet will react in kind...so the rule is ONE pet ONLY per trip and it is first request gets the YES...must post in the site area AFTER YOU HAVE SIGNED UP AND PAID FOR EVENT. If you show up to the site with a pet that you do not have a email approval from me ..you will be asked to leave the main site, again this is a safety issue. Please be kind and lets make this a great year. In addition, if you bring a pet with you...if you are found to be neglecting your pet, ie not feeding, ignoring, forgetting, losing etc and other members are taking time to fix these issues you will get ONE and only one gentle reminder \u2026after that you will be removed from the group...Crazy Cool Campers are proud PET owners and we take care of our pets!<br>\n\nCHILDREN: New rules as of 2014 all children under the age of 10 must be off the main site or in their tent if it is a group site...by 10 p.m. NO exceptions...please don't ask just understand that some adults want some down time where they won't have to watch their language etc; Please note we have many Crazy Cool Camper Kids...they are all welcome and wanted. These posts are NOT directed at any one child they are merely designed to accommodate within reason as many members comfort levels as possible while still ensuring our Crazy cool Cids have fun too!<br>\n\n...all children 10 to 13 can remain in the main site until 12:00 p.m<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.7900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/highres_23119266.jpeg","photo_id":23119266,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/600_23119266.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/2\/thumb_23119266.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12677321,"name":"Denise","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/2\/1\/highres_14167201.jpeg","photo_id":14167201,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/2\/1\/member_14167201.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/2\/1\/thumb_14167201.jpeg"}},"members":46,"name":"East Coast Tent Crazy Cool Campers","id":1795379,"state":"NY","urlname":"East-Coast-Tent-Crazy-Cool-Campers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Crazy Cool Campers!"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Verona","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1299613485000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"stroller-walking","name":"Stroller Walking","id":19739},{"urlkey":"babies-of-2010","name":"babies of 2010","id":59142},{"urlkey":"babies-of-2011","name":"Babies of 2011","id":110763}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Moms-of-Verona-Caldwell-NJ\/","rating":4.76,"description":"<p>This group was founded in March 2011 and is for moms in the Verona and Caldwell area to get together to meet and socialize.

When we eat together as a group, we eat 100% vegan.<\/strong> <br> <br> We're the little sister group to our 10,000-member big sibling group, The New York City Vegetarian &amp; Vegan Meetup. <br> <br> Here is what makes our smaller group unique: <br> <br> * We've added a distinctly Brooklyn focus to our group. Whether it's picnics in Prospect Park, fireworks in Coney Island, hanging out in beautiful Brooklyn Bridge Park, or going to Brooklyn's amazing vegetarian restaurants, we'll be hosting events in Brooklyn year-round. <br> <br> * We still love Manhattan. We're going to be painting the town red, as small groups of us go bar-hopping among Manhattan's top bars and lounges. <br> <br> * Except for a couple of large outdoor events we host in the summer, we'll almost always be doing <strong>small<\/strong> events. Our group will continue its tradition of hosting dinners at Manhattan's best small vegan restaurants. <br> <br> * I love the water. Many of our events will be next to (and on) rivers, bays, lakes, and the Atlantic Ocean. <br> <br> * Expect to hear music, see plays, attend cultural events, go dancing, go drinking and clubbing, and generally do the unexpected, the exciting, the elegant, the relaxing and the beautiful. <br> <br> * While this is primarily a social group, we will sometimes engage in vegan activism and animal rights activism. <br> <br> This group is specifically meant for people who are \"socially conscious\" and also very nice. We're that friendly \"do-gooder\" type of vegan. :) We're good-natured and compassionate, AND we like to have a good time. :) <br> <br> Whether you're interested in our Manhattan vegan restaurant dinners, our outdoor and waterside adventures, our Manhattan nightlife, music, and cultural escapades, or our Brooklyn events, we invite you to join us for any or all of the above. Being vegan only adds to our fun in the cultural and entertainment capital of the world.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/b\/c\/highres_22099388.jpeg","photo_id":22099388,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/b\/c\/600_22099388.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/b\/c\/thumb_22099388.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":19503341,"name":"David Greene","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/7\/0\/5\/highres_17939141.jpeg","photo_id":17939141,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/7\/0\/5\/member_17939141.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/7\/0\/5\/thumb_17939141.jpeg"}},"members":2984,"name":"NYC Vegans: Brooklyn + Manhattan Dinners + Outings","id":1799247,"state":"NY","urlname":"nycvegans","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Vegans"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Plainfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1300217150000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"uterinefibroids","name":"Uterine Fibroids","id":6372},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"alternative-healing-of-fibroids-and-endometriosis","name":"Alternative Healing of FIBROIDS and Endometriosis","id":140044},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fibroids-A-Natural-Healing-New-Jersey\/","rating":4.83,"description":"<p>I started this group for my dedication in helping women with this terrible chronic disease.

The Seth Audio Collection, The Early Sessions (Books 1-9 of the Seth Material), The Personal Sessions, and other books by Jane Roberts. Author of \"Out Of Body Adventures\" (Contemporary Books 1988), he has been teaching workshops on the Seth material, Dreams, Out of Body Experiences and metaphysics throughout the United States and abroad for over 35 years. He has been on the faculty of many schools throughout the United States and has appeared on numerous radio and television shows. Over a 20 year period Rick worked with Jane's husband Rob Butts on the publication of previously unpublished Seth material.

It will also address the connection between these higher states of consciousness and the art of creating your own reality, including the elimination of any limiting beliefs that interfere with our energy, growth or fulfillment.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThroughout the body of the Seth Material, Seth discusses a major step in our growth which involves moving out of the \"official line of consciousness,\" the conventional framework of viewing reality. Again and again, Seth encourages us to take the steps that will lead to a new birth of consciousness, a new far more effective and far more expansive mode of operation, that he has alternately described as the \"higher intellect,\" the \"spacious mind,\" an \"expansion of identity,\" an \"awakening\", the \"magical approach,\" and \"spiritualized creaturehood.\"<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"When that point of awareness strikes you fully...a new kind of consciousness is born in you...You feel the birth of intellect and intuition together, in a high intellect, in which you recognize your own superior functioning.\" -Seth<\/blockquote>\n<p>In this intimate class setting we will explore key areas of the Seth material and support each other in achieving the \"awakening\" mentioned above. Select Audiotape excerpts of Seth speaking on these topics during Jane Robert's classes, including some never before published, will be integrated into the workshop. Topics covered will include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to trigger the \"higher intellect\" and \"accelerated states of consciousness\"<\/li>\n<li>Using direct links to the wisdom of the inner self<\/li>\n<li>Letting Go - Joining with the spontaneous self.<\/li>\n<li>The inner senses and our capacity for \"Direct Comprehension\"<\/li>\n<li>Conscious creation - The art of using your unlimited energy and power to create your ideal life...<\/li>\n<li>Reconnecting with your non-physical \"entity.\"<\/li>\n<li>Expanding your concept of identity and becoming a \"new, larger\" you.<\/li>\n<li>The \"magical\" approach and the pitfalls of the conventional \"rational\" approach.<\/li>\n<li>Moving out of the \"official line of consciousness\" - How to break free from stubborn cultural limiting belief systems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.6800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/highres_22319309.jpeg","photo_id":22319309,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/600_22319309.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/a\/d\/thumb_22319309.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14353828,"name":"Rick Stack ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/5\/0\/highres_12417680.jpeg","photo_id":12417680,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/5\/0\/member_12417680.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/5\/0\/thumb_12417680.jpeg"}},"members":48,"name":"New York City Seth Study Group (Instructor-Rick Stack)","id":1805904,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Seth-Study-Group-Instructor-Rick-Stack","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Seth readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Island City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1301330812000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Queens-Business-Networking-Group\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p>Welcome to <strong>\"The Queens Business Networking Group (QBNG)\"<\/strong>. <br \/><br \/>For <strong>4 years our main group The NYCBNG has been a leader<\/strong> in hosting business networking events.

We all need support. And our warm group energy gives lots of that support.<\/p>\n<p>Our teachers, Merrill and Tamaji, are also there to encourage and assist us. They also offer instruction to beginners, so they can comfortably explore the field for themselves, see if meditation enhances their lives as much as it does ours.<\/p>\n<p>As for instruction, our meditation teachings are simple and practical. We start beginners by showing them how easy it is to relax profoundly, rather than merely relaxing temporarily or superficially. For those who want more, then, we provide personalized meditation tools that deepen and expand inner peace and, ultimately, lead in the direction of complete Self-realization. What could be bad about that?<\/p>\n<p>Anyone is invited to visit one of our support group meetings. There is never any charge.<\/p>\n<p>Members can come to any or all of those meetings -- no advance notice is necessary. Did I mention we were accepting?

font-size : 16px\">And sometimes we just laugh our butts off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Each event has its own special twist for the wine &amp; food, and everyone attending brings something that complements the film.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">Our goal is to create a fun-themed dinner party around a movie....and the end result is often pretty amazing, as we have some super-talented chefs among us, who often whip up masterpieces that are truly a treat.\u00a0 But no worries at all if you don't cook! Picking up something on the way is just fine.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><span style=\"color : #000000\">We're also always happy to find new hosts for future events.\u00a0 All that's required is a space in NYC (Manhattan-Brooklyn-Queens) that can comfortably seat at least 8 guests, a large (37\"+) screen and be open to welcoming an eclectic &amp; interesting group of film-food-wine lovers into your home.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\">If this sounds like a group you might enjoy, sign on up!\u00a0 We can't wait to meet\u00a0you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/highres_304380122.jpeg","photo_id":304380122,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/600_304380122.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/thumb_304380122.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12285675,"name":"Wendy ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/e\/highres_10000622.jpeg","photo_id":10000622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/e\/member_10000622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/e\/thumb_10000622.jpeg"}},"members":659,"name":"NYC Indie-Foreign Film, Food & Wine","id":1816221,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Indie-Foreign-Film-Food-Wine","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Film-Food-Wine Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1302995794000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"attachmentparenting","name":"Attachment Parenting","id":1621},{"urlkey":"breastfeeding","name":"Breastfeeding","id":15534},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"baby-wearing","name":"Babywearing","id":17535},{"urlkey":"cosleeping","name":"Co-sleeping","id":17536},{"urlkey":"natural-birth","name":"Natural Birth","id":17543},{"urlkey":"cloth-diapers","name":"Cloth Diapers","id":17671},{"urlkey":"vaccine-alternatives","name":"vaccine alternatives","id":18804},{"urlkey":"elimination-communication","name":"Elimination Communication","id":22135},{"urlkey":"holistic-parents","name":"Holistic Parents","id":23974},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"home-birth","name":"home birth","id":38759},{"urlkey":"upper-west-side","name":"Upper West Side","id":42643},{"urlkey":"holistic-pregnancy","name":"Holistic Pregnancy","id":132022},{"urlkey":"child-directed-weaning","name":"child-directed weaning","id":169208},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Holistic-Parents-NYC-Upper-West-Side\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for NYC's Upper West Side parents who are looking to meet, support each other and share their experiences with holistic parenting.

It was concealed from the masses up until the end of the 20th century. Now we live in a special time, when Kabbalah becomes available to everyone who has an interest in spirituality. Bnei Baruh is a non-profit organization . Everything it offers is free to use: online classes, book downloads, etc. The goal is not to make a profit, but to make authentic Kabbalah accessible to all who are ready to learn. If you are ready, join us and all our friends around the world on this fascinating journey - a quest to gain an inner knowledge of nature of everything that ever was, is and will be. Kabbalah is not about believing, but about getting to know.

My daughter, almost 3, is Chinese &amp; Korean and just starting to talk up a storm.  She sings songs in Chinese, counts to 10 in Korean but speaks mostly in English.  I want to make sure she's fluent in every language but don't want to confuse her.  I've got lots of questions and am surprised at how little there is out there to help our little ones along.<\/p>\r\n<p>I created this meetup group to unite multilingual families and provide events where they can share info and experience to help each other succeed. I'm going to be organizing events with speakers who can tackle issues like when to introduce the 2nd or 3rd language and what is going on with the kids in their development at different ages.  Speakers will also address the emotional and cultural issues within mixed ethnic background families.<\/p>\r\n<p>My personal passion for this group stems from my own inability to converse in Korean.  I can read and write Korean but my parents came from a generation that believed their kids wouldn't succeed in English if they were taught Korean.  I cannot converse with my relatives, only their children who grew up here speaking English.  I can speak French better than Korean which I learned in high school.  This has frustrated me all my life.  I believe that children are sponges and very capable of several languages, and in this changing world isn't it necessary?  I'd just like to help make it as easy and fun as possible.  Anyone with me?

April 11, 2016 was my 8th year anniversary. My mom was a breast cancer survivor of over 40 years, unfortunately she died last summer. I was in my early 20's and a college student when she was diagnosed. My daughter was only 15 and a high school student when I was diagnosed. I remembered as a young woman how devastating this disease was to me and my family. I watched mom who sufferred from clinical depression spiral deeper into a depression that was absolutely terrifying and wondered if this was the face of breast cancer.<\/p>\n<p> My dad believing he was helping did not allow the Reach to Recovery Volunteers visit mom nor were we allowed to speak about her cancer, her mastectomy or her depression. As a young college student I feared not only would I be diagnosed with breast cancer one day but I too would not be able to navigate the disease, medically or psychologically or have a full recovery.<\/p>\n<p> As a psychotherapist specializing in trauma, especially women's issues, I vowed this would be different for my daughter when I was diagnosed. I had treated many women diagnosed with breast cancer throughout my career but now I had to personalize it. I designed a Mind\/Body Program for my own initial recovery and now wish to create a support meetup group for educational, recreational and supportive activities.<\/p>\n<p>Our group organizers are currently redesigning&nbsp;the&nbsp;group to include yoga classes in addition to a monthly meet up group.<\/p>","lon":-74.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/1\/7\/highres_23169239.jpeg","photo_id":23169239,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/1\/7\/600_23169239.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/1\/7\/thumb_23169239.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14640162,"name":"Catherine Putkowski-O'Brien","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/9\/d\/highres_12740381.jpeg","photo_id":12740381,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/9\/d\/member_12740381.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/9\/d\/thumb_12740381.jpeg"}},"members":34,"name":"Moving Ahead in the Pink- S.I.'s Breast- Cancer Group","id":1824784,"state":"NY","urlname":"Moving-Ahead-in-the-Pink-S-I-s-Breast-Cancer-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1304555616000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"graphicdesign","name":"Graphic Design","id":781},{"urlkey":"aftereffects","name":"After Effects","id":3291},{"urlkey":"videoblog","name":"Videoblogging","id":10073},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"adobe-photoshop","name":"Adobe Photoshop","id":15293},{"urlkey":"adobe-after-effects","name":"Adobe After Effects","id":17212},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"motion-graphics","name":"Motion Graphics","id":19344},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"videography","name":"Videography","id":27494},{"urlkey":"video-marketing","name":"Video Marketing","id":54468}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAfterEffects\/","rating":4.62,"description":"<p>This group is by, for, and about users of the popular Adobe\u00ae After Effects\u00ae software - which is the industry-leading solution for creating visual effects.

I created this group because I'm committed to achieving my dreams and I want to offer that same opportunity to those around the world. I live in NYC AND this group is for everyone on the planet. The purpose of this group is to create a powerful 'master mind' effect for each and everyone of us. What that means is to create a group of people who have big dreams and goals in their life and are also desiring to be around others who aspire to achieve whatever they choose to BE, DO or HAVE in their life. The effect of being around a group of people who are like minded, positive, and entrepreneurial who are up to manifesting great things in their life is AMAZING. It's similar to 1+1=3! You get more than usual with other's focused energy. Solo, you'd get the more boring 1+1 = 2. The only requirement is that you've listened to a specific CD\/audio set that is all about you creating and manifesting anything and everything you want in your life. It's a requirement only because it will allow us to support each other. There is a certain way of thinking and believing that you are introduced to in the training so by listening we'll all be on the same page and in essence be speaking the 'same language'. If you are interested in BEING, DOING or HAVING anything you want in your life please contact me and I'll start you off by sending you 2 mp3 files that last about 35-40 minutes in total that'll let you know if this group or information is truly for you or not. Either way it's fine. It may not be for everyone. It just allows you to get clear on what this is about so you're clear on what this is about. I look forward to hearing from you and helping YOU ACHIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE, DO OR HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. FEEL GOOD NOW!

We raise awareness in communities through hosting educational events and speaking engagements. We collaborate with government agencies and non-governmental organizations to establish acceptable preventive measures, identify victims, expose traffickers and users, and promote slave-free practices. We provide funding for programs that support survivors of human trafficking through medical assistance, vocational training and economical development, so that survivors are better prepared to re-enter society.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">Slavery still exists; it is just better hidden today than it was in the past. In fact, there are currently more human slaves in the world than ever before in history &ndash; an estimated 27 million adults and 13 million children around the world are victims of human trafficking. Every year, over a million men, women, and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own countries and abroad. Human trafficking is a crime against humanity. It deprives people of their human rights and freedoms, it is a global health risk, and it fuels organized crime. Victims are used for a range of exploitative purposes - sexual exploitation, forced labor, organ harvesting, and combat fighting, among many others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">The Human Trafficking Awareness (HTA) Council was founded to fight against this horrific evil and we are asking for your help. Only together, we can make a difference. We are looking for volunteers that would like to help us, in support of humanity, to raise awareness of this devastating reality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : justify\">Regardless of your background or expertise, there is a place for you in the HTA Council and we need your support.

Move naturally and easily into higher areas of awareness and help life flow in a smoother and happier direction. One form of personal meditation we explore is known as a \"Spiritual Exercise\". This form of simple meditation, using your creative imagination, strengthens your inner guidance and helps you recognize your true identity as Soul, an eternal and divine spark of God.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing needs to be taken on faith. Experience it yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Have you had one of the following spiritual experiences? Come and share; learn more about connecting to direct guidance and achieving personal growth.<\/p>\n<p>* Past-life recall or having a sense that you have lived before (in a meditation or dream)<\/p>\n<p>* Dreams -- that opened awareness, expanded your consciousness, told of a future event, gave you an answer<\/p>\n<p>* Out-of-body or near death experience * Seeing an inner light<\/p>\n<p>* Hearing an inner sound<\/p>\n<p>* Inner guidance (angel, spiritual master, departed loved one)<\/p>\n<p>* Knowingness (intuition, coincidence, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu)<\/p>\n<p>* Unconditional love (from a family member, friend, pet, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>* Sense of oneness, divine love<\/p>\n<p>* Connection with all life -- greater awareness, feeling of inner peace<\/p>\n<p>Creative techniques are discussed in these Meetups to further explore our inner worlds. Similar to meditation, yet more active, these contemplation techniques, such as singing the ancient love song to God, HU, (pronounced 'hue\") helps with self improvement, brings self empowerment through greater inner understanding, opens consciousness, helps in understanding how karma is created, how to work through it, and gives guidance on how to achieve states of Self and God Realization.<\/p>\n<p>HU, this ancient and sacred word for God, can be found in the Jewish Kabala, Christian Gregorian chant, Buddhism, the Sufi teachings, Chinese Taoism, as well as in the path of Eckankar. It is a universal word with a very high vibration. You are invited to try it anytime you would like, either out loud or silently to experience the effects for yourself.

We host technical presentations and lectures, product demos, lightning talks, seminars, town hall-style open forums and hands-on tutorials, in addition to less-structured monthly gatherings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why graphs? Why now?<\/strong><br>\n\nGraph structures and methods are being used everywhere. As the size of datasets being generated, processed, and presented continues to grow, the relative strengths and weaknesses of different data structures, including graphs, have become more and more significant in everyday applications. Meanwhile, wider awareness of graph concepts (thanks in large part to the popularity of online social networks and widespread adoption of machine learning techniques) has increased the use of graph methods in a variety of fields. As a result, the last few years have seen renewed interest in academic circles, and a large number of companies and independent efforts putting a great deal of effort into creating faster, more scalable, and more reliable graph databases and ever more powerful interfaces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why another meetup? Isn't [NoSQL NYC, etc.] enough?<\/strong><br>\n\nWe don't think so. There are many great NoSQL meetups, but the current pace of innovation in graph database technology and graph theory is such that keeping on top of developments requires an immense amount of dedication. Our intention is to save our members time, money, and effort by providing a venue for sharing domain-specific experiences and best practices, scheduling useful programs for people at all levels of knowledge and experience, and creating a strong local community around graphs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Am I missing something?

Mindfulness also helps us cultivate greater resiliency for life's inevitable&nbsp;ups and downs.<\/p>\n<p>Our suffering is real and no surprise with the speed and complexity of our lives as well as the stunning degree of change that our society and world are manifesting daily. It is no wonder that we are stressed out and our coping mechanisms are often at the limit of their effectiveness, which can make exhaustion a frequent experience.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is for those who are attracted to changing their relationship to stress via mindfulness meditation practices. Practices are taught with simplicity, without the contrivances of religious ritual. The group nourishes each person by allowing them to discover their own way via their own self-aware experience.

They are sacred spaces that embody an atmosphere which nourishes the spirit and softens tension, facilitating inspiration and inner peace. The Hudson Valley Park is part of network of more than fifty such parks located around the world.&nbsp; <br> <br> The Hudson Valley Park is a 5-acre property with a retreat center which overlooks a large meadow, with several meeting rooms, a fully equipped kitchen, library and lodging for 12. The real beauty of the Park is a dense and hilly forest with winding paths, a sacred fountain, a wide stream fed by a waterfall and a hill known as the Summit, that is both a lookout and a natural meditation \u201chall\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hudsonvalleypark.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.hudsonvalleypark.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/a\/c\/600_438704972.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><span><strong><span>A day of spiritual inspiration and Silo's Message<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Interspersed with walks in the forest, we practice a guided meditation that helps us gain energy and awareness. We also learn about practical yet profound tools to help overcome the difficulties and contradictions we face in everyday life. Group discussions and sharing are also a valuable part of our activities. &nbsp;Meditating with others and sharing helps to enrich the experience.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the fundamental themes that we are concerned with are: meaning in life, growing happiness, discovering one\u2019s Purpose, unity, surpassing suffering, transcendence and immortality.<\/p>\n<p>The seminars and retreats are based on <em>Silo\u2019s Message<\/em> which is divided into three sections, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Nature-Meetup-Day-trips-out-of-NYC\/pages\/Meditation\/\">The Book<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Nature-Meetup-Day-trips-out-of-NYC\/pages\/The_Experience\/\">The Experience<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Nature-Meetup-Day-trips-out-of-NYC\/pages\/The_Path\/\">The Path<\/a> and the <em>Manual for Messengers<\/em> (both are available at amazon.com or can be downloaded for free at silo.net).&nbsp; <br> <br> The Message is not a course or a religion or a self-help group. It's a&nbsp;<span>simple and powerful way to experience the sacred within you and around you. It\u2019s not important what you believe.

Bringing actors, singers, dancers, musicians, writers, artists, designers and anyone else who works in the arts together in a venue that will allow us to vent, strategize and share our experiences working\/performing in fields dominated by the Left. As the group grows and as the election approaches, we may channel our angst into non-arts related activism as well.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n2. Providing ample opportunity to network with others in the arts: professional opportunities, gigs, auditions, \"I heard that so and so needs a professional ___\", the possibilities are endless.

Providing a supportive and encouraging atmosphere to shamelessly promote your upcoming performance, exhibition, book, etc. Bring any promotional material with you and make other conservatives your new fans (and friends!).<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIt's high time the Big Apple has a united, conservative, artistic voice.

Kirtan meditation consists of hearing and chanting sanskrit names for God to the accompaniment of melodious and rhythmic music in order to invoke God's divine mercy and presence. Bhagavad Gita As It Is is studied according to the ancient, yet unbroken, chain of teachers, as taught originally by Krishna and eventually Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Rupa Goswami, and more recently A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Everyone will read verses together from the Bhagavad Gita, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. Atma and Subhie will together explain the Bhagavad Gita verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for a combined forty years. We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p>\n<p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful Bhagavad Gita As It Is with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation of $10.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the Bhagavad Gita by the name Krishna.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the general schedule of our meetups: we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about twenty minutes -- until about 8:20 p.m. Then, we have a class on Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which lasts for about an hour and twenty minutes. In the class, we will go through verses of the Gita in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. By about 9:40, the last kirtan begins; it lasts for about twenty minutes. A delicious and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p>\n<p>Admission to each meetup is free. Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p>\n<p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and Bhagavad Gita. He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship for 75% of tuition. Currently, Atma spends his weekdays as a securities fraud federal prosecutor. His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p>\n<p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught Bhagavad Gita in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom.

It was concealed from the masses up until the end of the 20th century. Now we live in a special time, when Kabbalah becomes available to everyone who has an interest in spirituality. Bnei Baruh is a non-profit organization . Everything it offers is free to use: online classes, book downloads, etc. The goal is not to make a profit, but to make authentic Kabbalah accessible to all who are ready to learn. If you are ready, join us and all our friends around the world on this fascinating journey - a quest to gain an inner knowledge of nature of everything that ever was, is and will be. Kabbalah is not about believing, but about getting to know.

Most of the time at these meeting was wasted listening to elevator pitches - because no was really listening! They were thinking about what they had to say instead of what everyone else had to say. Nobody was buying because everybody was selling. We might listen to a few chosen speakers and a list of announcements... It seemed like we were doing everything except networking. In the little time that was left people were focused on grabbing what business cards they could. At the other extreme social events are fine, but they tend to be loud, it is hard to hear and you have no way of knowing who else is in the room. It is very inefficient, particularily if you are new to the group. The purpose of this group employ a simple, new system that eliminates everything that doesn't directly contribute to networking. to help business people build strategic alliances, identify prospects and promote themselves faster and more efficiently than ever before. There are no membership fees or application fees. We do charge a modest event fee so that we can have a dedicated space rather than a noisy restaurant or diner. The goal is always to maximize the experience for our networkers. Whether you are an \"Old Pro\" or new to networking - building a 5 Second Network is the fastest, most efficient way to grow your circle of influence and jumpstart a community of alliances.<\/p>","lon":-74.2200012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/d\/3\/highres_36765011.jpeg","photo_id":36765011,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/d\/3\/600_36765011.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/d\/3\/thumb_36765011.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14529017,"name":"Paul Holland"},"members":50,"name":"5 second network","id":2114751,"state":"NJ","urlname":"5-second-network","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Networkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1309690398000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"kitchenreno","name":"Kitchen Renovation","id":210},{"urlkey":"homeremodel","name":"Home Remodeling","id":2538},{"urlkey":"homebuyer","name":"Home Buyers","id":6785},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"first-time-home-buyers","name":"First Time Home Buyers","id":19213},{"urlkey":"home-improvement","name":"Home Improvement","id":22171},{"urlkey":"kitchen-bathroom-renovation","name":"Kitchen & Bathroom Renovation","id":25778},{"urlkey":"apartments","name":"Apartments","id":31380},{"urlkey":"real-estate-first-time-and-return-home-buyers","name":"Real Estate: First Time and Return Home Buyers","id":34015},{"urlkey":"first-time-home-buyers-workshop","name":"First Time Home Buyer's Workshop","id":34018},{"urlkey":"apartment-owners","name":"Apartment Owners","id":60993},{"urlkey":"buying-a-home","name":"Buying a Home","id":72834},{"urlkey":"home-renovation","name":"Home Renovation","id":75696},{"urlkey":"renters","name":"Renters","id":86115},{"urlkey":"selling-a-home","name":"Selling a Home","id":173028}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrickUnderground-NYC-Real-Estate-Meetup\/","rating":4.7,"description":"<p>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brickunderground.com\">BrickUnderground.com<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong>is NYC's&nbsp;online survival guide to finding an apartment and living through the aftermath.&nbsp;Our meetups empower NYC renters, owners, buyers, sellers, vertical dwellers and aspiring vertical dwellers by connecting them to our no-b.s. experts and to each other.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/2\/3\/highres_36827651.jpeg","photo_id":36827651,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/2\/3\/600_36827651.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/2\/3\/thumb_36827651.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10943146,"name":"Teri Rogers","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/3\/3\/highres_11664115.jpeg","photo_id":11664115,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/3\/3\/member_11664115.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/3\/3\/thumb_11664115.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"BrickUnderground.com's NYC Real Estate Meetup","id":2115371,"state":"NY","urlname":"BrickUnderground-NYC-Real-Estate-Meetup","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Vertical Dwellers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1309717952000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"developing-deep-frienship","name":"Developing Deep Frienship","id":62122}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sex-The-City-NYC\/","rating":4,"description":"<p><i>If you loved the show or just the lifestyle and energy depicted, this is your meetup.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>The original SATC group was founded in the sister city, London <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sex-The-City-London\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sex-The-City-London\/<\/a> I can tell you there were some serious socialites and good times had in The Big Smoke.

The group focuses on a new topic each&nbsp;month and all members have a chance to share their ideas. At Socrates Cafe, everyone is a teacher and everyone is a student - we all have brilliance to offer. Together we can contribute to building a deeper understanding of some of life's thornier questions.<\/p>\n<p>The group will meet around once a month from 7-9 PM.

We also have a fast-growing guitar orchestra open to all that performs new and traditional repertoire and provides a great opportunity to play with other guitarists and improve musical skills. We present 13 concerts a year in two different concert series.

Great for stress-relief, breath control, consciousness in all you do, a great compliment to regular yoga or martial arts practices. Dynamic. Controlled and focused explosions. Awareness of your energetic state (how you feel, where you feel what, how your environment is affecting you, how to not feel drained after meetings, phone calls, long travel, long days at the office, etc). We're also trained in some more well-known asana yoga traditions and martial arts traditions. If you're interested, jam session, but aharaj yoga is a bit different so you'll have to come and experience this ancient tradition that is pre-preparation for stressful meetings, jury duty, sports competitions, long-time meditations, and exam time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I6gdJ1DkmIE\">See a teaser-trailer for Aharaj Yoga<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"345\"><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/ToqLZZDP9Gg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/object><\/p>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"345\"><br>\n\n<\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Dance Meditation<\/strong> - dance, move, stand still, lie down, and sweat it out.

That way you're sure to actually be included in the conversation.<br> <br> We have a RSPV limit to most places we meet. If you RSVP, try and show up.

It also can be annoying to see a 25$ admission fee for the privilage to purchase 10$ drinks. We are not that.

Operating as a community of like-minded professionals, OWASP issues software tools and knowledge-based documentation on application security. All of its articles, methodologies and technologies are made available free of charge to the public. OWASP maintains roughly 250 local chapters in 110 countries and counts thousands of members.<\/p>\n<p>OWASP was started in 2001 and has operated since 2004 as the 501(c)(3) charitable OWASP Foundation which supports its infrastructure and projects. Its leadership is completely volunteer and makes decisions about technical direction, project priorities, schedule, and releases. OWASP has less than (10) employees to keep its operating costs low. OWASP collects corporate and individual membership dues and conference fees to award grants each year to promising AppSec research projects.<\/p>\n<p>OWASP projects fall into two basic categories: development projects and documentation projects.

I know you're out there and are busy with your professional lives and perhaps you have family obligations as I do. The purpose of this group is to initially meet for a bimonthly game of Pathfinder and to escape from reality a couple times a month. I've had the books for two years now &amp; I've kept putting off this group because other things just keep coming up. That's life, right? It's now or never. I believe the bimonthly meetup will allow greater flexibility in the beginning. This group is for players that are 30 years old and up so if you don't make the requirement please don't ask to be a member of the group.&nbsp; If you are interested in a group that plays by the rules although bends them at times (who has time or the patience to keep track of how much you're carrying or&nbsp;your rations&nbsp;in the game although what player could carry 5 suits of full plate anyway?) then this is the group for you. The group will not simply be a hack and slash type of group although I'm sure there will be lots of encounters and melee. If you want a primarily hack and slash type of play then join a MMO game or a younger D&amp;D v4.0 group&nbsp;so you don't waste our time or yours.&nbsp; I find the most efficient use of time is to utilize modules and some creativity. The groups I have most enjoyed in the past usually rotated with a different person hosting each game at their home. Having said all this I do want to add that I am a very open minded gamer and I still am learning the Pathfinder game myself although I believe my experience with v3.5 of D&amp;D has helped prep me for this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you don't meet the age requirements (30 y.o.)&nbsp;then I'd recommend looking at some of the local gamestores as well as other message boards.&nbsp; Best to you in your endeavors.<\/p>","lon":-74.3600006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/highres_59139142.jpeg","photo_id":59139142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/600_59139142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/6\/thumb_59139142.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3796819,"name":"RPGamer1971","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/7\/2\/highres_25231602.jpeg","photo_id":25231602,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/7\/2\/member_25231602.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/7\/2\/thumb_25231602.jpeg"}},"members":124,"name":"Pathfinder Dungeons and Dragons version 3.5 RPG Meetup","id":2545442,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Pathfinder-Dungeons-and-Dragons-version-3-5-RPG-Meetup","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.9099998474,"who":"Adventurers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Middle Village","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1317059103000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"specialed","name":"Special Education","id":1677},{"urlkey":"adhd","name":"ADHD","id":12126},{"urlkey":"autistic-spectrum-disorders","name":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders","id":21466},{"urlkey":"autism-moms","name":"Moms of Autistic Kids","id":23808},{"urlkey":"adults-with-aspergers-syndrome","name":"Adults with Asperger's Syndrome","id":25053},{"urlkey":"autism-spectrum-disorder","name":"Autism Spectrum Disorder","id":71211},{"urlkey":"asperger-syndrome","name":"Asperger Syndrome","id":77838},{"urlkey":"aspergers-support-group","name":"Asperger's Support Group","id":83682},{"urlkey":"autism-support-group","name":"Autism Support Group","id":88584},{"urlkey":"autism-awareness","name":"Autism Awareness","id":89446},{"urlkey":"parents-of-children-with-autism","name":"Parents of children with autism","id":106085},{"urlkey":"autism-professionals-network","name":"Autism Professionals Network","id":455992},{"urlkey":"supports-coordination","name":"Supports Coordination","id":456202},{"urlkey":"autism-services-delivery","name":"Autism Services Delivery","id":456212},{"urlkey":"mr-dd-professionals","name":"MR\/DD Professionals","id":456282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Autism-Awareness-Acceptance-AAA-w-Play4Autism\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><span><span><span>OUR MISSION\u200b is to increase the public's awareness and acceptance of Autism, while improving the quality of life and hope for children.&nbsp;We will achieve this goal by&nbsp;introducing&nbsp;children on the Autism&nbsp;Spectrum&nbsp;and&nbsp;their families&nbsp;to our&nbsp;Kidz into Action Program.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This will help to improve their self-esteem&nbsp;and social interaction, increase their communication and leadership skills plus teach them how to sustain regular lifelong physical activity&nbsp;as a foundation for&nbsp;a<br> healthy, productive and fulfilling life.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Such can also help an&nbsp;individual improve their skills in areas such as sensory issues, behavior, cognition, perceptual\/motor skills, and self-reliance or self-determination.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We also believe that by teaching children the basics of organized individual instruction &amp; team play they will learn the values of teamwork &amp; community in a fun and safe atmosphere.<br><br>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.play4autism.org\/\">www.play4autism.org<\/a> to learn more about us!<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>Thank you for taking the time to read through our sites and we look forward to you being a member of the P4A Team. \n<br> \n<br> Greg Vasicek \n<br> President &amp; Founder \n<br> Play4Autism Foundation \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/highres_363590302.jpeg","photo_id":363590302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/600_363590302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/7\/e\/thumb_363590302.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2480299,"name":"Helena L.

Mainly we hangout and have a good time.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully being among other creators will inspire you.<\/p>\n<p>You are not required to donate but if you want to cash is preferred to avoid transaction fees.<br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/e\/2\/highres_60672002.jpeg","photo_id":60672002,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/e\/2\/600_60672002.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/e\/2\/thumb_60672002.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3409223,"name":"Mike","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/f\/9\/highres_244666329.jpeg","photo_id":244666329,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/f\/9\/member_244666329.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_244666329.jpeg"}},"members":711,"name":"The New York Aspiring Comic Creators Club","id":2582052,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-New-York-Aspiring-Comic-Creators-Club","category":{"name":"sci-fi\/fantasy","id":29,"shortname":"sci-fi-fantasy"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Aspiring Creators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Mountain Lakes","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1317760272000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sunshineyogahikes\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>Ignite your spirit with Sunshine! &nbsp;This group is designed to bring yogis and yoginis together for community hikes and Outdoor Vinyasa Yoga.

I won't use it commercially or to cash in on people like meetup organizers of some other groups attempt to. The only time there might be a fee\/donation is for a Thanksgiving Feast, Holiday Dinner Feast or something like that for a group meetup and we split the costs evenly. In the past, I have taken the time to personally cook giant feasts for 12+ hrs for everyone in the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>This group was originally set up as a 20's 30's group. That said, I've met some cool people that are in their 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's or older over the years with good life stories. War vets, scientists, doctors, barbers, mechanics, actors, artists, and others.&nbsp; If some of you want to bring a cool grandparent or something like that to a meetup I organize, feel free to bring one. They often have the best stories. I would like to make this group welcome to all ages.

I live by the waterfront\/Gantry Park off the Vernon\/Jackson stop, but people from other areas of LIC, and even Astoria\/Sunnyside\/etc. are welcome to join as well.<\/p>\n<p>Events will include drinks at local bars, trying out restaurants in the area, and exploring all that Long Island City, Queens, and the rest of New York City have to offer.\"<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>

We are grateful to be called to our great work, each one of us with our various gifts that we offer you as we light up the path.<\/p>\n<p>Our teacher Erika, is a shamanic energy practitioner and a lover of the sacred feminine, who was asked by spirit to create a sacred place for women to gather in light. She was called to create this group out of the longing she felt deep in her soul, one that seems to be a universal condition. We as women have an inner fire to create newness which fills the universe with positive energy. This women\u2019s circle is the opportunity.&nbsp;The Sacred Feminine has long been rejected in society as well as in ourselves. It is time to bring honor to her. Honor the maiden, Honor the Mother, Honor the Crone. There is wisdom in everyone of us. The Sacred Feminine wisdom is deep and wide, powerful and bright, fully of mystery, full of honor.<\/p>\n<p>Our teacher Leslie, is a visionary artist , energy healer and painter of The Divine Feminine. She has been called to gather the woman, and create a tribe of light workers to creatively express themselves in all areas of their life and work. We as women have a creative purpose and utilizing our consciousness together can change the world, even if it starts with ourselves. Teaching Intentional Creativity Methods we encourage you to kindle the fire and invite transformation on your path of becoming. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our teacher Linda, is a Reiki master instructor and mosaic artist inspired to assist others on their healing journey through energy work and artistic expression. &nbsp;Deep healing takes place when we connect with the Divine, the highest part of ourselves. &nbsp;Linda's desire is to kindle the spark of creativity present in each one of us and assist in birthing that process. Linda also facilitates workshops with area youth to help them tap into their highest potential through mosaic art.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Luminous Way<\/em><\/strong> is continuing the great work from <strong><em>Becoming a Luminous Women<\/em><\/strong> path. Finding a sacred space within to just be, allowing your sacred journey to come alive, and fill the world with love. Here we listen to our inner place of guidance. A place that enables all women to live with honor and grace.&nbsp;This circle allows women to find other luminous beings to share wisdom and light. We are interested in healing and energy work. Our paths unique, yet connected. Come, create, share, grow the Luminous. Allow us to keep you company on your Luminous Way.

Games to be played include Trivial Pursuit (natch),\u00a0 Blast From The Past, Chronology, Facts in Five, Finish Lines, The Logo Game, Newshound, Smart Ass, 20 Questions, Who Am I?, Wits and Wagers and more. Different games will be played at each meetup, and there's over\u00a030 games. Meetups will take place in Manhattan on weekends, at least twice a month, more often if the group catches on. IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ - while these games are mostly easy to learn and fun to play, they ask questions or provide clues to specific answers. Therefore, having general knowledge in various subjects is required to play and enjoy these games. For some games, you'll be on a team or partnered with someone, so it won't always be up to you to come up with an answer. But again, given the format of these games, a general knowledge in various subjects is required. Subjects covered include Geography, History, Literature, Science, Sports and the various areas of Pop Culture (Movies, Music, Theater and TV). If you're looking for games like Monopoly or Taboo, this is NOT the meetup group for you (there are meetup groups for those games, by the way). A list of the games to be played is shown in the Discussions section of these boards. If you've read the above and feel you qualify, sign up and join. If you know others who are trivia geeks, let them know about this group.

Divergent creativity flowers when limits on length (and size\/complexity) are combined with themes that encourage participation, provided the tools available make actual production and sharing quick and easy. It happened with short-form Japanese poetry as a mass participatory art several centuries ago and could happen with animation if we had the software and hardware needed to let laymen easily animate from scratch and control frame speed for better viewing. They are not because makers have focused on the pre-existent commercial CAD market and 3-D animation movies and games rather than developing tools for a market they cannot imagine. I believe that we can create and collect a body of work clearly demonstrating the overlooked potential of hypershort (as a rule, 100-frame or less*) animation that may convince makers to cooperate. Such must include interesting work by and surveys of groups of students who are not all art-majors, as showing off our best work alone will only prove we are an exceptionally creative group rather than proving the popular feasibility of the genre itself. Anyone interested in doing and\/or helping to develop hypershort animation is welcome to join whether or not you have animation experience to date, can draw well or think creatively. Please bear in mind the fact that even otherwise be boring or even ugly figures can prove very entertaining when animated. Even someone who draws poorly can be a star. Or, you can start with pre-existent figures in famous paintings or cartoons by Edward Lear or Thomas Hood and make them do something. If that is not easy enough, the work of animation may be split up. The larger theme, idea for the plot, frame-by-frame plotting and actual drawing might each be done by a different person.

As most members of the group\u00a0were not in Brooklyn,\u00a0on May 31, 2012, I renamed\u00a0us Flipped-out in NYC and\u00a0increased my debt to pay\u00a0the requisite dues for another 6 months which should be time enough to find a co-organizer or managing director (?). Ideally, that person would have: 1) imagination enough to\u00a0see the unlimited possibilites of hypershort animation; 2) access to, or at least knowledge about,\u00a0software and hardware as members who lack the means to create\u00a0need help\u00a0-- perhaps a teacher or outgoing student at a top arts school or an independent artist, affluent and knowledgeable enough to make this possible; 3) the time to be fully engaged with others.\u00a0 To members of the original group, I apologize for not following through -- I knew I lacked 2) but after finding I had less funds but more research to do in\u00a0the limited time I had in NYC, learned too late that 3)\u00a0made it impossible to continue.\u00a0 I will continue as founding-member\u00a0as the concept of Flipping-out has been mine since the 1990's and I want to be part of what happens, but plan to\u00a0stay pretty-much hands-off.\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/highres_73390802.jpeg","photo_id":73390802,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/600_73390802.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/3\/2\/thumb_73390802.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1831396,"name":"robin d. gill","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/e\/f\/highres_16513551.jpeg","photo_id":16513551,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/e\/f\/member_16513551.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/e\/f\/thumb_16513551.jpeg"}},"members":61,"name":"Flipped-out In NYC -- Hypershort Animation Initiative","id":2830762,"state":"NY","urlname":"Flipped-out-In-NYC-Hypershort-Animation-Initiative","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1321638650000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"psychics","name":"Psychics","id":1523},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"mediumship","name":"Mediumship","id":16603},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"conscious-movement","name":"Conscious Movement","id":18717},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"spirtuality","name":"Spirtuality","id":53440}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Heal-Yourself-and-the-Planet\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p>This group is for spiritual people to come together to discover the divine inside and to bring that energy and transmit that energy out into the world.<\/p>\n<p>Inner peace is one of the most powerful gifts to embrace and acknowledge. It helps us open up to our divine nature and rid ourselves of the distortions allowing us to feel more joy and love in our lives. When we are in that state life becomes easier and our world flows in more supportive ways then we can imagine. As we are in that natural peak&nbsp;state we&nbsp;&nbsp;are able to radiate this energy&nbsp;out from us&nbsp;.With this attunement we gift the world with all the wonderful qualities of peace, love, compassion&nbsp;that we&nbsp;are holding; in&nbsp;that space we create &nbsp;for ourselves and others we are able to &nbsp;transform the planet with our good intentions. We are thereby creating a ripple effect that flows around the entire universe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Recently on 11-11-11 people from all over the world meditated for world peace and oneness. The planet has felt the shift in the energy. Maybe some of you who are sensitive to energy feel that shift. When we get together collectively we build that energy, the collective consciousness for positive change . You are invited in this group to shift to your highest consciousness to help heal yourself and the planet.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all people who would like to have more peace, love, and happiness in the world. The group will have social activities, and workshops on helping create the shift and healing energies to develop yourself more fully. Each person of us can make a difference and all we need is the willingness to put our energy into that intention. The group will have a spiritual focus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorld peace must develop from inner peace. Peace is not just mere absence of violence.

(Arabic: tasawwuf) is the mystical view and the inner dimension of Islam. For sufis themselves it means the complete religion, the realization of devotion to God, and the experience of love in the heart. In addition to the Islamic way of life, sufi followers engage with practices and prayers for the purification of the heart and improving one's character (adab). The loving guidance of the sheikh (the spiritual master) provides for certitude and clarity on the sufi way (tariqa). Burhaniya Disuqiya Shadhuliya is the sufi order (tariqa) of Sayyidi Ibrahim Qurashi Disuqi (13th Century A.D.), the fourth of the great sufi sheikhs and founders of sufi orders (aqtab). The spiritual line (silsila) of the Burhaniya sheikhs trace back to the Prophet Mohammed (s.). The Tariqa Burhaniya has spread out in the time of Sayyidi Fahruddin Sheikh Mohamed Osman Abduh al Burhani (\u2020 1983) and his son Sayyidi Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed Osman (\u2020 2003). Today, under the leadership of Sheikh Mohamed Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed Osman, there are thousands of followers and hundreds of Burhani communities all over the world.

If you're an expecting mama, if you are a new mom of young little ones, or if you are a home stay mom you could still join the group with the understanding that most of our time will be spent at play grounds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The objective of this group is to connect with other moms with young little ones, to share information, enjoying play groups while exploring different parks, museums, gardens, and so on in New York City and possibly beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/toddlertheexplorer\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/toddlertheexplorer<\/a>, and on&nbsp;twitter at&nbsp;<a class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/GDWKids, and<\/a> on tumblr&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/j.mp\/gooddayswithkids\">http:\/\/j.mp\/gooddayswithkids<\/a> <span>for tips, ideas, and more that's geared towards toddlers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Thank you and I look forward to meeting you and your little one(s) in person very soon.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Selam. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/1\/e\/highres_435748958.jpeg","photo_id":435748958,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/1\/e\/600_435748958.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/1\/e\/thumb_435748958.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8452059,"name":"Jehiah","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/6\/highres_5298678.jpeg","photo_id":5298678,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/6\/member_5298678.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/6\/thumb_5298678.jpeg"}},"members":974,"name":"Toddler the Explorer!","id":2910272,"state":"NY","urlname":"toddler-the-explorer","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1323145913000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"russian","name":"Russian Language","id":982},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement","name":"Civic Engagement","id":37181},{"urlkey":"community-organizing","name":"Community Organizing","id":39474},{"urlkey":"interfaith-and-intercultural-dialogue","name":"Interfaith and intercultural dialogue","id":42728},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"jewish-and-interfaith-families","name":"Jewish and Interfaith Families","id":81948},{"urlkey":"immigrants-rights","name":"Immigrant's Rights","id":102661},{"urlkey":"immigrant-support","name":"Immigrant Support","id":283991}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Just-A-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is Just A Meetup - a place where we chill out &amp; meet just for its own sake, mostly in Washington Heights and Inwood. &nbsp;Please join and come to the meetups with some of our folks without any further commitment.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11761352,"name":"ddg"},"members":41,"name":"Just A Meetup","id":2910702,"state":"NY","urlname":"Just-A-Meetup","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Folks"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1323194611000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"brooklyn","name":"Brooklyn","id":16794},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Venture-Community\/","rating":4.59,"description":"<p>Brooklyn Venture Community (BVC) is a Meetup focused on the <a href=\"http:\/\/charlieoliver.me\/portfolio-4\/brooklyn-venture-community\/\">Brooklyn venture community<\/a>.

Thus, &ldquo;Da Truth,&rdquo; was born. &ldquo;Da Truth,&rdquo; is a place where men and women can find out the answers to their questions and use this knowledge to improve their existing relationships or develop new loving relationships. It is also a place where new ideas and techniques can be discovered so that we can begin to close the communication gap between men and women. We welcome you to &ldquo;Keep It Real,&rdquo; and air out your feelings about your relationship dilemmas in a respectful environment.

The workshop follows the centuries old tradition of the education of emerging artists in the working studio of a professional artist. It is inspired by the artist\u2019s workshops of Renaissance Europe. These workshops existed, and still exist, in all cultures and historical periods. It is and was in these workshops where the application of the \u201ccraft and science of art\u201d was practiced and taught to the emerging artists of the next generation centuries before art academies where established. It was, and still is, a creative environment where practice and theory work hand in hand. In these workshops of the past many fine works were produced and are now exhibited in museums and collections through out the world, and are the great treasures of human culture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>The workshop is followed by a salon where lectures and videos are presented and discussed<\/strong> in a lively, erudite and friendly atmosphere. The intellectual process of learning about the history, philosophy and metaphysics of art is as important as the application of the science of art, in the making of art. So the Workshop &amp; Salon is both craft and theory oriented.<\/p>\n<p>As Leonardo Da Vinci said:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Those who are in love with practice without science are like the sailor who boards a ship without rudder and compass, who is never certain where he is going.<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Practice must always be built on sound theory.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leonardo Da Vinci<\/strong> <br> <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Artist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE RENAISSANCE WORKSHOP &amp; ARTIST SALON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taught by Artist-Instructor: Ra\u00fal-Santiago Sebazco<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Diploma Graduate: National Academy School of Fine Arts \/&nbsp;New York University Bachelor of Fine Arts&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Winner of International travel grants to study at: Le Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, France<\/p>\n<p>Centro des Bellas Artes, Madrid, Spain<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/4\/6\/highres_442096198.jpeg","photo_id":442096198,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/4\/6\/600_442096198.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/4\/6\/thumb_442096198.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3020391,"name":"RSS","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/0\/8\/highres_34913512.jpeg","photo_id":34913512,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/0\/8\/member_34913512.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/0\/8\/thumb_34913512.jpeg"}},"members":313,"name":"The Renaissance Workshop & Artist Salon","id":2993862,"state":"NY","urlname":"Renaissance-Workshop-Salon-for-the-Arts","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Emerging artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1325102646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"young-adults","name":"Young Adults","id":17649},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SocialCircleNYC\/","rating":4.97,"description":"<p>Making new girlfriends in NYC can be awkward - approaching a girl in a bar who looks like a cool person just seems weird.<\/p>\n<p>This is the group for you if you're in your mid 20's - mid 30's, are new to the city or just looking for some fun, new, real friends.

This is not a superficial singles discussion; it\u2019s an exclusive social experience based on the concepts of Erich Fromm, Abraham Maslow, Karen Horney, Albert Ellis, and other greats in humanistic philosophy and psychology. The philosopher Martin Buber said that life is an encounter with oneself, others and nature, but we need to have these encounters enhance warmth, mutual understanding and health. In this new series of Meet-ups, on the third Friday of each month, we will explore all the many aspects of interaction and relationships that ultimately make our lives more gratifying and effective. With guidance from an experienced group moderator, participants will create an experiential dialogue of sharing and learning, followed by relaxed socializing and light refreshments.

He can help you with your professional and personal speaking goals.&nbsp; The focus of our club is on advanced public speaking, but we welcome anyone who wants to join Toastmasters.&nbsp; Since we are an advanced club, a new member is expected to complete their first 10 speeches (the Competent Communicator series) in a more accelerated time frame than in a regular Toastmasters club.&nbsp; We will also view speeches from famous authors and professionals and see how we can incorporate those ideas into our speeches.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>If you have any presentations that you are creating for your career or other endeavors, our club is a great place to receive useful feedback and advice for your project.&nbsp; You want to move ahead and we can help you do that.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone can learn and network while having a good time and some laughs. See you all on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of each month.&nbsp;For more information, please call Stephanie Spruyt,&nbsp;Toastmasters International at 917-952-0136.<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/e\/highres_103287582.jpeg","photo_id":103287582,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/e\/600_103287582.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/e\/thumb_103287582.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6838994,"name":"Stephanie ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/a\/0\/highres_121149632.jpeg","photo_id":121149632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/a\/0\/member_121149632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/a\/0\/thumb_121149632.jpeg"}},"members":274,"name":"Advanced Brooklyn Communicators Toastmasters","id":3126672,"state":"NY","urlname":"Advanced-Brooklyn-Communicators-Toastmaster","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Forest Hills","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1326914450000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"vegan","name":"Vegan","id":408},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"single-seniors-socializing","name":"Single Seniors Socializing","id":94728}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NY-single-senior-vegetarian-vegan-meetup-group\/","rating":4.63,"description":"I decided to start the group's  because I would like to meet other veg\/vegans.

Join us for friendly monthly fly tying nights, excursions, food, drink and lying about all aspects of their fishing experiences.<\/p>","lon":-74.25,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/2\/4\/highres_113086372.jpeg","photo_id":113086372,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/2\/4\/600_113086372.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/2\/4\/thumb_113086372.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":16424801,"name":"Christopher ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/a\/0\/highres_39686272.jpeg","photo_id":39686272,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/a\/0\/member_39686272.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/a\/0\/thumb_39686272.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"The Vise Squad - Fly Tyers Group","id":3203842,"state":"NJ","urlname":"ViseSquad","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.4099998474,"who":"Fly Fishers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1328022263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/democracy\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><strong>OUR MISSION<\/strong> <br> <br> This Meetup strives to make New York City a Model for 21st Century Democracy.

Pit bulls and bully breeds are welcome! Don't have a dog? Adoptable dogs and fosters are welcome, as well and have them wear an adopt me vest!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mission Statement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of Positive Pittie Pack Walk (PPPW) is to create a structured environment to exercise and socialize our dogs. We recognize the importance of being responsible dog owners in order to raise confident, stable dogs, while working towards improving the image of pit bull type dogs. We welcome all types of dogs, and encourage owners who are working on reactivity and socialization issues to join us. Our dogs are always in training, and PPPW strives to be a constructive experience for every dog and his owner, regardless of what issues they are working through.<\/p>\n<p>In order to achieve our goals, all members must abide by the following rules. There will be no exceptions. Anyone who cannot abide by these rules will be asked to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No dog interactions:<\/strong> at no point before or during the walk shall dogs be permitted to greet one another, sniff each other, etc. There will be no physical interaction between the dogs whatsoever. It is the rhythm of walking together as a pack that is a positive, dog-social experience. To that end, structured pack walking can be an incredibly therapeutic, rewarding experience for a dog. However, if you are looking for a group where your dog can \u201cmeet\u201d new dogs and play, this is not the group for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minimum one handler per dog<\/strong>: one human per dog, and one dog per human. Extra humans welcome to help organize the pack!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Space:<\/strong> when we begin our walks, we will aim to keep approximately 5 feet between each dog. As the walk progresses, and the dogs get into the groove of pack walking, the distance between the dogs will likely reduce. Towards the end of the walk many dogs may end up walking side by side. Although, some dogs may require additional space throughout the entire walk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow Instructions:<\/strong> A few organizers will be navigating throughout the pack as we move along. If an organizer asks you or your dog to move up towards the front or hang towards the back, please do so, and don\u2019t take it personally! The goal is to find where each dog fits in to the pack most comfortably, and modify accordingly. Every dog will be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No Retractable Leashes:<\/strong> in order to ensure that each handler has proper control of his or her dog, please use leashes of no longer than 6 feet, and leave the retractable ones at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Local Laws and Ordinances:<\/strong> At no time will PPPW violate local leash laws, and all owners are expected to clean up after their dogs. Furthermore, please be sure that your dog has the proper licenses and vaccinations displayed on his collar before joining the group.<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/highres_227322262.jpeg","photo_id":227322262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/600_227322262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/thumb_227322262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11680467,"name":"Jaime","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/highres_43507232.jpeg","photo_id":43507232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/member_43507232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/thumb_43507232.jpeg"}},"members":215,"name":"Positive Pittie Pack Walk","id":3220942,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Positive-Pittie-Pack-Walk","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Pack Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1328217860000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"newcareer","name":"New Career","id":2790},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-owners","name":"Business Owners","id":15417},{"urlkey":"law","name":"Law","id":18368},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"career-transition","name":"Career Transition","id":24110},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"woman-entrepreneurs-business-networking","name":"Woman Entrepreneurs Business Networking","id":96909},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Small-Business-Support-Group\/","rating":4.89,"description":"<p>I started this meet-up group to form a support group for owners of small businesses.

Motorcyclers!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>QUEST! isn't an acronym. QUEST! is simply the gathering of people whom enjoy motorcycling adventures in whatever form they may appear! All types of motorcycles are welcomed. BMW, Ducati, Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, Victory, Honda, Indian, Can-Am, Yamaha, etc.. You must be licensed, insured, &amp; be a responsible experienced motorcycle rider.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Picture this in your mind\u2026 It\u2019s a warm, sunny Saturday morning in June. Temps are expected to hover around 75 degrees. You\u2019ve had difficult days at work last week &amp; between piano lessons &amp; baseball practice for the kids you\u2019ve been running non-stop. You just changed the oil in the car and just sat down to relax and maybe have an ice cold one. As you reach into the fridge for what you thought was the last can of the six-pack you realize that you polished it off the nite before. Arrrgh! You\u2019re on empty! As you grab the car keys to head out to the local 7-11 your smartphone chimes. It\u2019s an alert that a brand new QUEST! Meetup is happening in a few hours. There\u2019s a ride to a classic car show at Bear Mountain and the Budweiser Truck (along with the Smoothie King truck for you non beer drinkers) will be there! There will be live music too!<\/p>\n<p>You can almost taste the ice cold fizz of the King of Beer\u2019s sliding down the back of your parched throat\u2026but you haven\u2019t started your bike all week. The chrome is dusty, you haven\u2019t checked your tire pressure in weeks, and you need to top off your tank. The QUEST! riders are meeting to ride up to Bear Mountain together so you gotta BOLT!\u00a0 You say to yourself \"It\u2019s never just a \u201cMeetup\u201d with that group\" so this may turn out to be a great day! Where's my microfiber cloths?\u00a0 Where's my wallet?\u00a0 Where are the keys to my bike? I think I\u2019ll put a hold on that frosty brew until I see the QUEST! riders. It's more fun with that merry band of misfits anyway...\"<\/p>\n<p>You can finish the story above any way you choose. We've played it out a hundred times since we began riding motorcycles. Whether in New York, Louisiana, Florida or Colorado. Motorcycle riders enjoy others who also ride! Motorcycle riders are a very tight knit bunch. You don\u2019t have to know the lady rider at the traffic light sitting on her bike waiting for the light to change. You give her a nod and a smile through your helmet. She\u2019ll smile back, give you the two finger flip and off you go! That\u2019s why I created QUEST!. To answer the call to RIDE!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Excitement. Laughs. Pure enjoyment of the road. \u00a0These are some of the things you'll be a part of with Quest! \u00a0Below are a few more...<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Call to Adventure<\/strong> - Motorcycle rides will be our core focus! Long or short. Interstate or out of state. Day trips, over-nighters or weekend runs. QUEST! will also participate in some motorcycle rallies as a group. (Americade, Laconia, Roar to the Shore, etc..) With the \u201cofficial\u201d riding season lasting only seven (7) months, only active riders may suggest Meetups. We want you to be an <strong>ACTIVE<\/strong> member of QUEST! After 60 days of inactivity, riders whom have not participated in a ride will be removed indefinitely from the Meetup. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>I\u2019m not so interested in the number of riders whom join QUEST! as I am with building a great motorcycle riding collective<\/strong><\/span><strong>!<\/strong> Join to ride.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Journey<\/strong> \u2013 Launching out before dawn for a leisure ride to Pt. Pleasant, NJ for a day at the beach. Riding to Central Park Summer Stage to lounge on the Great Lawn to watch a free concert. Exploring twisties in the Catskills &amp; Adirondack Mountains of NY State. Riding through Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania &amp; Delaware Water Gap. From Springtime motorcycle maintenance opportunities where a certified motorcycle mechanic will be available to answer questions about your bike to Summertime rides for Maine Lobster and Philly Cheese Steaks in Philadelphia, to Fall foliage runs...the journey begins with QUEST!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Return<\/strong> \u2013 If you ride you know that visiting places by motorcycle is better than seeing them from the inside of an automobile. The freedom that motorcycling offers is like nothing else. The wind. The sounds. The scents. The open road. After a long day of riding we\u2019ll pause to gather our thoughts of the day and bid farewells. Each ride is expected to offer something new. Every return home to our families and loved ones is a successful ride. Come on out and join QUEST! As a QUEST! rider you will be more than just a rider. As adults we all have various experiences &amp; talents which may lend themselves to a better\u00a0QUEST! experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>QUEST! Motorcycle Group is built upon 5 Core Principles:<\/p>\n<p><strong>A) Individual Respect &amp; Integrity \u2013 If these 2 principles need\u00a0explaining then QUEST! isn\u2019t for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>B) Personal Safety \u2013 Assuring that your Motorcycle is in good working order and you're wearing proper motorcycling gear, equipment and that all your NYS DMV papers are current and in order. This not only protects you as a rider, but your fellow Quest! riders and other travelers on the road.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>C) Responsible Ridership - YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS &amp; BY REQUESTING TO JOIN QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS, UPON APPROVAL YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS THEREIN! \u00a0YOU RIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK! \u00a0QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS NOR ITS LEADERSHIP TEAM ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE HURT BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER PARTICIPATING ON A RIDE. \u00a0 RECKLESSNESS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED DURING A RIDE. \u00a0IF IT IS NOTICED THAT YOU ARE CAUSING A HAZARD TO OTHER QUEST! RIDERS YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE! \u00a0NO EXCEPTIONS!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>D) TeamWork &amp; Good Sportsmanship - No one rider\/member is bigger than the collective Group. Period!\u00a0 We are a team!\u00a0 We are one.\u00a0 No one gets left behind.\u00a0 We ride for fun! That's what the QUEST! experience is all about!\u00a0 Let's enjoy the QUEST!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>E) Respect For The Ride - Ride &amp; Have A Great Time!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In sum, my endeavor in creating QUEST! is that each journey impact member lives positively. Have you ever heard the saying \u201cRide to Live, Live to Ride\"? I believe every person may be at different places in their lives where anything can impact them richly or meagerly. With this new Meetup I hope riders who join will enrich my life &amp; yours\u2026but only if we\u2019re courageous enough to allow ourselves to truly embrace\u2026 the QUEST!<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/highres_97997042.jpeg","photo_id":97997042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/600_97997042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/thumb_97997042.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":120705822,"name":"winston","photo":{"photo_id":214685612,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/e\/c\/member_214685612.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/e\/c\/thumb_214685612.jpeg"}},"members":262,"name":"QUEST!

I'm using the vast amount of Japanese pubs in the NYC area to recreate typical nights in Tokyo. Whats better then taking a couple hours to share some drinks and Japanese small plates and forget about the outside world with a good group? Maybe after we can belt out some tunes at a Karaoke house, or play some billiards, or go to another Izakaya?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Also, this group has become very diverse in the events we hold. Outside of weekly happy hours and weekend Izakaya hang outs we have participated in a wide variety of other cool, Japanese-centric things. Some of the events we have attended include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japan Block Fair<\/li>\n<li>Concerts (Japanese)<\/li>\n<li>Ramen Contests<\/li>\n<li>Sake\/Shochu Tastings<\/li>\n<li>Japanese food fairs and tasting events.<\/li>\n<li>Trips to the Japanese market.<\/li>\n<li>Other Asian restaurants.<\/li>\n<li>Izakaya crawls.<\/li>\n<li>Asian film festivals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>\"Is this a Japanese food club?\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No not exactly. Actually in Izakayas the spirits get the spot light. The food is complimentary to the sake, shochu, and beer. That doesn't mean you need to be a raging alcoholic to join. I myself am not a big drinker. But this is a pub based group. Still Japanese food lovers should do OK with this group too as we have visited many Japanese restaurants. I also like to include some nightlife when the group is not ready to go home. Its not unusual to end up singing karaoke, shooting pool, or finding a roof top bar and enjoy the view.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this explains the group.

The Deeksha brings about a growth in consciousness, thus heightening your life experience. The Deeksha changes emotions and perceptions or helps one be free of perceptions. This shift changes one\u2019s approach to challenges and opportunities since when perceptions change one no more perceives a problem as a problem. When perceptions change reality may also change because the external world is merely a reflection of the inner world. Higher perceptions and positive emotions create a more successful and fulfilling life.<\/p>\n<p>Effort does have a role in the Deeksha. While effort in the form of introspection, contemplation, asking the right question, having an intent, external doing etc. is also essential. The role of effort in this context is analogous to a plane speeding on a runway to take off, but the actual take-off also demands an appropriate wind current. The Deeksha is like the current that finally lifts the plane off the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Deeksha is given by the laying hands on the recipient\u2019s head or sometimes through intent. In this case, the giver holds the receiver in his or her awareness for a few minutes and allows the Deeksha to flow. In this way, the Deeksha can be given at a distance of thousands of miles or to a large group of people all at the same time. Deeksha unfolds differently in every individual as it depends on what the receiver may need it most.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the common benefits in receiving a Deeksha as reported by the recipients. One can experience greater effects of it with prolonged exposure.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Awakens creative potentials, abilities and intelligence <br> \u00b7 Increases ability to learn <br> \u00b7 Resolves inner conflict leading to inner peace and harmony <br> \u00b7 Brings love to relationships <br> \u00b7 Heals emotional hurts and reduces thought burden <br> \u00b7 Evokes affection, friendship and a sense of connectedness with the other. <br> \u00b7 Awakens compassion <br> \u00b7 Infuses vitality <br> \u00b7 Heals the body by healing the mind <br> \u00b7 Relaxes the body and relieves stress <br> \u00b7 Helps build love and appreciation for the body <br> \u00b7 Invokes auspicious energies <br> \u00b7 Removes blocks that hinder success <br> \u00b7 Makes possible a mental frame for abundance <br> \u00b7 Initiates a journey into experiencing unconditional love and joy <br> .

This is achieved by the process of the Oneness Deeksha \/Oneness Blessing which is a phenomenon sourced in the deep passion and the intent of Sri Amma &amp; Sri Bhagavan. <br><\/p>\n<p>Oneness Deeksha (aka) Deeksha is an energy transfer that brings about growth in consciousness. The level of consciousness of a person determines his\/her quality of life experience. For instance, one\u2019s experience of the ongoing recession, the ability to handle misunderstanding in relationship or a daughter\u2019s rebellious nature, what emotions surge through when diagnosed with a health problem, the level of connection with people around and the joy experienced, the intensity of passion at work etc., depend on one\u2019s level of consciousness. As consciousness rises, there is greater awareness, joy, love, togetherness, and focus in everything that you do and experience. <br><\/p>\n<p>The Deeksha neither requires practicing a particular way of living nor is an initiation into following a new path. It does not bind one to any philosophy or ideology.
