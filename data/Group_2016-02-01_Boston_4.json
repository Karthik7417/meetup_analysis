Looking forward to making lasting friendships for us and the little ones :) The $ dues will go to the monthly meetup organizer cost. About the organizer: I recently moved to the North Shore and after previously meeting the most amazing friends on a baby meet-up group. What started as playdates at library programs turned into Holiday Parties, themed playdates, and more then our share of Mimosas :) Having a good group of mom friends can certainly break up the monotony that often takes the lead with little ones.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" &nbsp;- Buckminster Fuller<\/i><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Town Hall is an old New England tradition<\/b>&nbsp;going back four centuries, that involved true democratic participation of all citizens in their community's social and political decisions. &nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>In &nbsp;the 21st century in Newton Massachusetts we do not have a system of democratic participation. Newton politics is run by an insular political clique who do not truly welcome citizen participation. They view any citizens who attempt to participate in the political process as a nuisance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The politicians will perform a pantomime of allowing citizen participation, but it's just a sham, and they will end up doing whatever they intended to do all along, after they finish their charade or pretending to listen to feedback from the public.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Newton's politicians do not care what is best for the community, and they certainly don't care what any of the citizens think about anything. What they care about is their own positions of power, the business dealings that are at the root of all their decisions, and the status symbols of their titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you've ever attempted to get involved in Newton politics at any level you will probably recognize the truth of the above paragraph. You may also have come to the realization of the futility of expecting to ever be able to change the way things are run in Newton politics.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>The idea of <b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;is to start from scratch, to scrap the established way of running decisions, and try to envision what a truly democratic and reasonable form of local government would be. This must be a form of interaction where everyone has the right to be heard, and truly listened to, and where decisions are based on reason, sense, logic, and commitment to what is genuinely best for the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The manners of behavior and procedure that are conducted by the current political system must be discarded, because these behaviors and procedures clearly do not work in favor of the goals of true democracy. These behaviors are designed only to maintain the power dynamics of the politicians, to keep them powerful and you powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To begin with, then, we must dispense with the insincere behaviors of handshaking, gavel-wielding, and applause.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;must create a model of how local government <i>ought<\/i>&nbsp;to be conducted. We will develop this on our own, as ordinary citizens, without the participation of the politicians. We won't need to beg for their permission or approval, because this is something we will do on our own, separate from their procedures and outside of their jurisdiction to dictate to us how we can and cannot act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>NewTown Hall <\/b>will be an alternative, ad hoc, non-binding self-government system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>For more on the concept of Buckminster Fuller:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidmcelroy.org\/?p=18991\">http:\/\/www.davidmcelroy.org\/?p=18991<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p>\"We can't defeat the existing system; we must build a better one instead\".<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.1900024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/d\/4\/highres_445139860.jpeg","photo_id":445139860,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/d\/4\/600_445139860.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/d\/4\/thumb_445139860.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196042797,"name":"What's in a name?","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/c\/2\/highres_251903746.jpeg","photo_id":251903746,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/c\/2\/member_251903746.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/c\/2\/thumb_251903746.jpeg"}},"members":4,"name":"NewTown Hall","id":19166021,"state":"MA","urlname":"NewTown-Hall","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Informed Citizens"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brookline","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448843498000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brits-in-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"A meetup group for British expats living and working in the Boston area.

Have you ever felt happiness in your life... ...never lasts? This Buddhist group has a great positive, multi-cultural atmosphere that helps people search for the answer to life's biggest questions. Through the teachings of Buddha and historical Pure Land Buddhist teachers we understand better the direction our life needs to take in order to find the purpose of life. We offer video lectures and have meetings to discuss how to obtain an absolute form of happiness. I hope you'll stop by and attend a meeting when you have a chance! Below, you'll find some more information about what Buddhism is all about as well as our contact info and location. In Buddhism, we learn that there are two kinds of joy. Relative Happiness All the happiness we know is called Relative Happiness. Money, status, fame, wealth, family, friends, and our loved ones are all included in this category. Politics, economics, medicine, and the arts also try to provide us with Relative happiness. We seek for this type of happiness day in, day out hoping we can attain true satisfaction from it. Absolute Happiness We are all seeking for a happiness which will truly last. This kind of happiness is called Absolute Happiness. The purpose of life is to attain it as quickly as possible while still alive.

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in Boston. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have.

Long live hardware!<\/p>\n<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.<\/p>\n<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.<\/p>\n<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the \"onesy\" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or \"dumb\" cars?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being \"merely\" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The Boston Connected &amp; Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64960062,"name":"Babak Kia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/highres_247682322.jpeg","photo_id":247682322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/member_247682322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/thumb_247682322.jpeg"}},"members":65,"name":"Boston Connected & Intelligent Device Meetup","id":19232780,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Connected-Intelligent-Device-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Endpoints"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Natick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450824655000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"sketch","name":"Sketch Comedy","id":8207},{"urlkey":"education","name":"Education","id":8476},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"beginners-acting-training","name":"Beginners Acting Training","id":15919},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"courses-and-workshops","name":"Courses and Workshops","id":20629},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"actors-actresses","name":"Actors, Actresses","id":31083},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"theatre-and-performance-acting-workshop","name":"Theatre and Performance Acting Workshop","id":37506},{"urlkey":"improv","name":"Improv","id":53513},{"urlkey":"acting-classes-for-adults","name":"Acting Classes for Adults","id":70493},{"urlkey":"lgbt-friendly","name":"LGBT Friendly","id":107996},{"urlkey":"peer2peer","name":"Peer2Peer","id":952412}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/metrowestperformers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>This is a Natick-based acting and improvisation group for anyone (18 and older) who is interested in acting, improvisational comedy or other aspects of acting.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.3499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/highres_445378718.jpeg","photo_id":445378718,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/600_445378718.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/thumb_445378718.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":25209652,"name":"Mark Schuman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/highres_249437640.jpeg","photo_id":249437640,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/member_249437640.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/thumb_249437640.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"Metro West Performers","id":19233336,"state":"MA","urlname":"metrowestperformers","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Performers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stoneham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450829694000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"activities","name":"Activities","id":15116},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"fun-activities","name":"Fun Activities","id":17224},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"loosing-weight","name":"Loosing Weight","id":25879},{"urlkey":"healthy-lifestyles","name":"Healthy Lifestyles","id":32598}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Stoneham-Fitness-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Hello!

It is the opportunity for believers and non believers to get together and share their philosophical views on existentialism, share their struggles in the defiance towards status quo or peer influence, and find happiness through open mindedness, volunteer work and other sorts of humanism. I developed a philosophical posture in life called Igocentrism. Science has shown us how the three main sources of happiness are the so called Intrinsic Sources: self growth, relationships and the giving to others. However, society is negatively impacted by the pursuit of the so called Extrinsic Sources: money, status, and physical appearance. I believe this unrelenting idolatry towards the feeding of one self leads to ego-centrism, so I figured an appropriate antonym should name this new-founded ideology. Igocentrism also focuses on the liberation from religious belief, as in the societal definition of \"religion\". It is a deist approach to the existence of God - not necessarily atheist and yet open to the possibility of a non intellectual creator - which commends a utilitarian morality over an epistemological religious morality based on scripture. This group is intended for people who would like to learn more about igocentrism and hopefully find bliss in what could very possibly be the only finite life we have in this world.<\/p>","lon":-71.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/highres_445470094.jpeg","photo_id":445470094,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/600_445470094.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/thumb_445470094.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197384954,"name":"Ricardo Martins","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/highres_252416562.jpeg","photo_id":252416562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/member_252416562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/thumb_252416562.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"I.G.O Society of Free Thinkers","id":19250158,"state":"MA","urlname":"I-G-O-Society-of-Igocentric-Free-Thinkers","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.2400016785,"who":"Igomaniacs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451425174000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"charity-work","name":"Charity Work","id":16453},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"charity","name":"Charity","id":25598},{"urlkey":"cancer-support-group","name":"Cancer Support Group","id":33425},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Young-Professionals-Group-The-Lemon-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"The Lemon Society of Boston is a young professionals group which allows members to network with other like-minded professionals, build leadership skills and contribute to a worthy cause all while having a great time!

Increasingly studies are attesting to the powerful effects sound vibration has on our physical and emotional well-being. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mantra, which means \u201cthat which saves the mind\u201d or \u201cinstruments of the mind\u201d, is a collection of mathematically precise and melodic Sanskrit sound vibrations designed for specific energetic intentions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the Maha Mantra called the \u201cgreat\u201d Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This specific Mantra deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for two reasons: 1) it is one of very few mantras that combines both the feminine and masculine divinities simultaneously. 2) It can be chanted at any time and place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the origin of the Maha Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Mantra is found in the Kali-santara Upanishad, one of the 108 principle Upanishads, and was given by Brahma to the sage Narada.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the benefits of Japa Meditation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because the Maha Mantra combines both the feminine and masculine it is a Bhakti mantra or \u201cmantra of loving relationships\u201d. This works on transforming and improving the practitioner\u2019s relationships on three levels - 1) Personal (relationship with oneself); 2) Interpersonal (relationships with others); and 3) Spiritual (relationship with the divine). <\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Japa Circles?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles provide a powerful space in which the simultaneous recitation by all members amplifies the energy of the mantra exponentially. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What takes place at a Japa Circle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 15 minutes the practitioner fills out a four question survey and performs breathing and mindfulness exercises. For 30 minutes the actual Japa meditation takes place. Practitioners recite the mantra softly in rhythm and cadence with the instructor with increasingly relaxation and joy. The final 15 minutes is used for the concluding breathing exercises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of the Survey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles and the various level s can only measure quantity of a practitioner\u2019s Japa meditation. The purpose of the survey, which is private and for the practitioner\u2019s personal use only, is to help measure the quality of a practitioner\u2019s Japa meditation. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of the various levels?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Maha Mantra was handed down with a recommendation that the practitioner recite the mantra 35 million times! The various levels are designed to give us impetus and inspiration. However, in the more mature stages of our personal development these levels become superfluous as the joy and transformation awakened by our Japa meditation becomes its own reward. <\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120115562,"name":"Maha Visnu Gray","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/highres_158975632.jpeg","photo_id":158975632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/member_158975632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/thumb_158975632.jpeg"}},"members":25,"name":"Japa (Mantra Meditation) Classes - Everett, MA.","id":19254859,"state":"MA","urlname":"Japa-Mantra-Meditation-Classes","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Japa Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Littleton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451579956000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"electronics","name":"Electronics","id":7848},{"urlkey":"diy","name":"DIY (Do It Yourself)","id":10438},{"urlkey":"hacking","name":"Hacking","id":21123},{"urlkey":"arduino","name":"Arduino","id":39012},{"urlkey":"makers","name":"Makers","id":43887},{"urlkey":"makerspaces","name":"Makerspaces","id":101438},{"urlkey":"3d-printing","name":"3D Printing","id":114528},{"urlkey":"diy-technology","name":"DIY Technology","id":153215}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Littleton-Common-Makers-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><span>Littleton Common Makers is a organization where makers can collaborate to learn, share, and hone skills of all types.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>We are providing a space for hobbies, education, entrepreneurship, and engagement within the community of Littleton, Massachusetts, and beyond.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Email: info@lcmakers.com<\/p>","lon":-71.4800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197455695,"name":"Faisal Mohammed","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/5\/c\/highres_252458748.jpeg","photo_id":252458748,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/5\/c\/member_252458748.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/5\/c\/thumb_252458748.jpeg"}},"members":34,"name":"Littleton Common Makers Meetup","id":19255215,"state":"MA","urlname":"Littleton-Common-Makers-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.5400009155,"who":"Makers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451591948000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mbti","name":"Myers-Briggs Type Indicator","id":9714},{"urlkey":"enfj","name":"ENFJ","id":27761},{"urlkey":"personality-type","name":"Personality Type","id":46145},{"urlkey":"myers-briggs-type-indicator","name":"Myers Briggs Type Indicator","id":113453}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-MBTI-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group used to be for ENFJs one of the sixteen personality types of the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).

It is an opportunity for authors to work on Phase II: the phase after finishing your literary masterpiece. If you're an Indie author, you probably already know that writing is only half the work. The other half is promoting, advertising, practicing the elevator pitch, using keywords on your book description, etc. It's the part of being an author that most of us don't like but is just as important as good writing to increase book sales. If you want to dig in and get motivated, this group is for you. We'll be talking about everything that increase sales from getting honest reviews on sites like Amazon and Goodreads to tracking advertising efforts and their results. There is nothing shameful about being proud of your book and working hard to share it with the world.

Initially, we'll be in Braintree or Natick, Massachusetts, but we may gather elsewhere in New England as well.<\/p>\n<p>Our group is open to adult writers (you must be 18+ to join; younger teens are welcome to attend as the guests of adult members). Typically, our Meetups begin with introductions and a few creative prompts. Then we'll spend the rest of our time writing in companionable silence, with occasional breaks. Toward the end of the Meetup, we'll invite people to share what they've written, if they wish. Our venues have everything we need: private rooms with tables and chairs, restrooms, kitchenettes, and free parking. We provide extension cords and power strips for laptops and creative-writing guides for onsite inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, we may offer writing workshops, but for now, the focus is on simply gathering to write. Signing up for events is easy. Just join this Meetup group (membership is free). Then RSVP \"yes\" for the events that interest you.

Now what? Well, there are admirable heroes who can handle cancer diagnoses with grace and compassion; not for themselves solely but mostly for the sake of people around them. They are my idols but I knew from the get-go that I am absolutely not yet one of them. I want to scream, throw a tantrum, kicking up like a baby while whining and sobbing and swearing on the floor. I don't act like this all the time though because it requires a bit physical strength. Never less, I believe that we, the ordinary people, have the right to react to cancer however we wish to, and those superheroes need a break every now and then too. So I started this group with one goal in mind- for my fellow cancer carriers to be openly emotional, freely expressional, and swear at cancer until we exhausted all dirty words we know, then we go shopping and eating and dancing like no tomorrow. And then, we gather ourselves and get on with our ordinary life and live as healthy as anyone can be , until the next meetup. :)<\/p>\n<p>Yup, our menu includes screaming exercise (a.k.a Friday night dance club), anger management (a.k.a boxing with the cute gym coach), stress release exercise (a.k.a swearing phrase spelling bee, crying competition), group field trips (e.g. reiki, craniosacral therapy, princess spa, hair shedding shower, wig fitting party), and world peace, seriously (a.k.a trips around the USA and the world to drag our fellow cancer carriers out of their shells or their superhero masks, and share a lot of FUN and SHIT dealing with cancer!

Whether you help out full-time or just a few hours a week, caregiving is hard work and can be a strain on our emotional, psychological, financial, and physical well-being. Maybe you work at the same time, or have a family of your own to take care of, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This meet-up group is for informal caregivers of older adults on the South Shore. It is a space to socialize with others who understand your challenges, share your experiences and learn from other caregivers who are in a similar position, and hopefully have a few good laughs too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even if the loved one whom you cared for has recently passed, and you are still dealing with how all that feels you are welcome to join us. You were there, understand us and have something to bring to the group.<\/p>\n<p>Since taking on the care of my Mother 5 years ago, I personally feel somewhat isolated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My established friends do not stand my unique situation and don't understand the challenges and stress caregiving brings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join the group for coffee dates, lunches, brunches, dinners, seminars (when I can find them), guest speakers, or even movie nights and other events.

This Meetup is for people from all spiritual backgrounds, all faith and and belief systems, and all nationalities, who are interested in receiving help and healing on the spiritual path through Bruno Groening's teachings. <\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening (1906-1959), a simple German man, taught that \"a divine power exists and it can heal. \" He had very precise, intuitive knowledge of this healing power and&nbsp; made it freely available to everyone through his teachings, helping thousands of people receive help and healing. His teachings continue to be shared today through one of the world\u2019s largest non-profit organizations for spiritual healing, the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends.&nbsp; Healings continue to this day, even of so called incurable diseases, and are recorded and verified by medical doctors and psychologists in all major specialties who work together in the Circle of Friends' Medical Scientific Group (MWF).<br><\/p>\n<p>The Circle of Friends passes on these simple teachings free of charge through information lectures throughout the world. We invite you to attend Introductory lectures and film showings in the Boston area and experience this healing energy for yourself, in a simple and natural way. (See our Calendar for upcoming events.) There is no fee. Donations are appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening friends also meet locally every three weeks at Community Hours to take in the divine healing energy together. In the Boston area we currently have a Community that meets in Andover, and we are hoping to open another community closer to downtown Boston in the spring. Other New England Communities meet in South Hadley, MA, in Maine (Freeport and Ellsworth), and in Vermont (St. Johnsbury.) See our calendar for these&nbsp;Communities' schedules. All who wish to attend the Community Hours need to be introduced to the teachings of Bruno Groening beforehand, either at an Introductory lecture, or by phone.&nbsp; Contact the Organizer for more information.<br><\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you soon, and we invite you to contact us for more information. <br><\/p>\n<p> All warmest wishes to you on your path,<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Susan Downing <\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup Organizer and leader for New England Communities <br><\/p>\n<p>413-531-6677 <br><\/p>\n<p>susan.downing.bg@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Eric Guyer<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Leader of the Andover Community <br><\/p>\n<p>guyer.eric@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>More about the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends: The \"Bruno Groening Circle of Friends\" is a well respected international organization founded in 1979 by Grete Hausler (1922-2007) that was recently publicly awarded the \"Peace Pole\" by the United Nation's World Peace Prayer Society (WPPS), on May 23, 2013.

All our presenters are volunteers and members of The Divorce Center. We do not self-promote our own practices. We are committed to providing you with unbiased information in a compassionate and understanding way. Is Litigation the only way to go? Is Mediation or the Collaborative Process right for you? What is considered a marital asset in Massachusetts? How is child support and alimony calculated? How do we tell the children about our divorce? These questions and many others will be answered during our workshops. Each attendee receives our 32-page Resource Handbook as well The Divorce Center's Directory of Divorce Professionals. Light breakfast and beverages are included in the $30 registration fee. Pre-registration is required at www.thedivorcecenter.org. Workshops are held on the second Saturday of every other month in several Metro West locations. Other workshops say they donate their proceeds to a non-profit...we are the only non-profit in Massachusetts offering these services to the public. Your fee helps to support our mission of making divorce more civil and less traumatic, by providing you with the education and support you need to make the best choices for you and your family.","lon":-71.4300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":160000192,"name":"Diane Pappas","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/highres_216404192.jpeg","photo_id":216404192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/member_216404192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/thumb_216404192.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"The Divorce Center - Next Step Workshop - Untying the Knot","id":19412777,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Divorce-Center-Next-Step-Workshop-Untying-the-Knot","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453480015000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256},{"urlkey":"arts-culture","name":"Arts & Culture","id":154787}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MFA-Boston-Museum-Council-Meet-Ups\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Museum Council of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is a membership group for supporters ages 21 to 45 with exciting annual programming designed to bring you closer to the collections at the MFA and the arts scene in Boston.

This group aims to encourage engagement of inter-religious collaboration and dialogue for the sake of promoting understanding across faith systems and some tangible good in our community. &nbsp;Confessedly, this is one part class assignment. I recently attended a travel seminar where we observed inter-religious conflict and harmony in India. There we saw many instances where people of various religious backgrounds linked arms for the sake of social improvement: doing things like opposing gender inequality, inter-religious conflict, and caste system injustice. Nothing in India was perfect, but for a society that has been exposed to many major religions for so long, I wonder whether there is anything we can gain and apply in our context. I think any well-rounded conversation along these lines would include people who identify with all kinds of world-views: Catholic, Humanist, Agnostic\/atheistic, Spiritual but not Religious, Evangelical Christian, Mainline Christian, Unitarian Universalists, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Religious Other, Christian Other, Non-religious other, etc...<\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/5\/highres_446162693.jpeg","photo_id":446162693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/5\/600_446162693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/5\/thumb_446162693.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10357355,"name":"Jacob","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/1\/d\/highres_253193789.jpeg","photo_id":253193789,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/1\/d\/member_253193789.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/1\/d\/thumb_253193789.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Somerville Spirituality Meetup","id":19422135,"state":"MA","urlname":"Somerville-Spirituality-Meetup","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Engagers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Marblehead","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453653560000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wholefood","name":"Whole Food Nutrition","id":5951},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"plant-based-nutrition","name":"Plant-Based Nutrition","id":19490},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marblehead-Lees-Onlife-Wellness-Inspiring-Healthy-Living\/","rating":0,"description":"Lees-Onlife Wellness is dedicated to educating its visitors about myths of nutrition and the foundational role \"whole food nutrition plays in our longevity\". &nbsp;We&nbsp;inspire healthy living around the world by teaching some simple how-to's that are an ah...haa moment for many people.

I thought I would start a meet up for pregnant ladies who are just looking to make friends with other pregnant ladies and\/or young parents. <br>I'm 22 and moved to Boston (area.. Quincy actually) almost two years ago from Canada. I don't know any other young parents in the area or pregnant ladies at all here and figured there must be other people looking for new friends and a good support network too! So I am making this group to hopefully connect others who are in the same situation, who would like to meet and make good friendships with other pregnant ladies and\/or parents! My idea is to set up meeting spots once a week for whoever is free- to come along and I'll give details for each meetup! As well if anyone else wants to make their own 'event' or has a cool idea for a meetup spot and time feel free to post it or let me know or whatever!
