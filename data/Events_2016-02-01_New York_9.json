The reasons may be different. The prevailing ones are to save costs and\/or to wait until they are confident in the viability of the business.\u00a0 It is important to know how such business relationships are viewed according to the law and what provisions the law imposes on the participating individuals. When there is no formal agreement in writing, the law establishes certain default rules for governing such partnership. Those default rules often do not reflect the best interests of the partners but legally bind them when they have not established their own. However, there may be some equitable defenses to prevent a total windfall to one party if it contradicts with the initial understanding of the parties.<\/p> <p>During our meetup we will discuss<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 What is a general partnership?<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Which circumstances trigger its formation by default?

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/227788544\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklyvcbkc","time":1453939200000,"updated":1453952713000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"46 Bedford St","name":"The Village Tavern","lon":-74.004132,"id":684181,"state":"NY","lat":40.730593,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.53462064266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434662054000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/fullscreen\/968134759\/\">&lt;\/a&gt;Hello Run Chuggers!

When Greta violates a list of strict rules, a series of disturbing and inexplicable events bring her worst fears to life, leading her to believe that the doll is alive.\"<\/p> <p>As Mallory Ortberg of <a href=\"http:\/\/the-toast.net\/2015\/12\/03\/whos-coming-to-see-the-boy-with-me-next-year\/\">The Toast<\/a> so eloquently stated, \"Why do I have to wait a single second to watch this movie?\"<\/p> <p>UPDATE!

The next event will be at The Wall St Humidor. This is a huge cigar shop with a bi level lounge. We will be using the membership only lounge downstairs. In order to do so, each person will be charged a $20 fee but this will also take away from the cutting fee. You will be allow to bring your own cigars unless you want \u00a0to purchase here. He does has a nice premium selection. Puchasing a cigar will not take away from the $20 fee. We will have a few bottles of spirits on hand. If you decide to drink, you will be chipping in for the bottle. Andy Oh has been helping putting this together and so far has done a great job. By the way, the lounge downstairs is beautiful &amp; a smokers delight. Don't worry we are keeping the cost here as low as possible &amp; this will be cheaper then the other lounges we attend. Other then cigars, do not bring any beverages or food into the venue. As I said, we are dealing directly with the owner on this one, so nothing is written in stone. Any changes &amp; I will immediately post it. I've been here many times &amp; always a pleasure here. If you have any questions, please ask it under this post and I or Andy will respond to it. We are looking forward to a nice turnout here.

his project NEW POTT, Mischa Kuball transformed the homes of the 100 people he interviewed into a public stage where immigrants and their families provide glimpses into their lives and the experiences of different generations of immigrants. The multitude of histories and intimate moments that Kuball captured testify to the multiethnic melting pot that the Ruhr represents.<\/p> <p>Through its participatory nature, Kuball\u2019s work engages important questions about authorship, the relationship between art and public space, and the ways in which a work of art can accommodate experiences that emerge from different cultural backgrounds. Those questions also lie at the heart of Hans HS Winkler\u2019s works. His Walking Newspaper project, for example, invites audience members to become participants in the artwork and reflect on their political and surroundings and their own social background.\u00a0<\/p> <p>To what extent can art develop practices that enable people to intervene in public space? By creating new opportunities for participation and authorship, how does art open up new forms of representation that are not tethered to conventional institutions?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Artists Mischa Kuball and Hans HS Winkler will address these questions in a conversation that will conclude the exhibition NEW POTT at the German Consulate General New York.

Campos<\/p> <p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<br\/>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<br\/>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from\u00a0these Luso-African countries.<br\/>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England.\u00a0<br\/>Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<br\/>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<br\/>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<br\/>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing. A moment when the woman's beauty, enhanced by her partner, must embody all its essence. \" D.

Another young girl from his community is gone, and he must face his people with no more answers than before. The darkness of the forest is closing in on the village, and the night is full of horrors.

Even though he moved away from Italy, the executive chef at Massa' Coastal Italian Restaurant hasn't lost his sense of culinary adventure. He still visits Italy multiple times per year, helping him stay in touch with his roots and allow his food to show customers 'who he is'. He flies fresh fish in from the Mediterranean and makes daily trips to the Fulton Fish Market to prepare what he calls ocean-to-table cuisine. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westchestermagazine.com\/Westchester-Magazine\/June-2014\/What-To-Expect-From-Massa-Coastal-Italian-Cuisine\/\">Westchester Magazine<\/a>\u00a0praised Chef Francesco's eye for fresh fish and his delicate hand with sauces. The two converge with the pesce e crostacei, a fresh pick of the day grilled or oven-roasted and dressed in a sauce that enhances the seafood\u2019s flavors. The menu also features a variety of steaks and pastas.<\/p> <p><br\/>Some comments by other diners include: \"Massa's fish was so wonderful last night: whole branzino expertly flavored, with provincial sauce, carpaccio \u00a0of wild salmon, shrimp and swordfish belly skewered over great Gnocchi.<br\/>Even the new focacchia was special. \u00a0And the owner picked out a fine 2009 Montepulchiano which went with the meal. \u00a0 I feel so fortunate that this NYC quality restaurant is in our neighborhood.\"<\/p> <p>Another says, \"We moved to Mamaroneck from Williamsburg Brooklyn with average expectations for dining in the area. \u00a0Restaurant after restaurant we were left satiated but unimpressed. \u00a0One evening we popped into Massa, conveniently across the street from us. \u00a0The staff is well versed in the menu, knowledgable, professional and warm. \u00a0The food...it blew us away. \u00a0Clearly prepared thoughtfully and with love, the proportions are healthy without being overwhelming. \u00a0The chef specials are creative and complex, leaving you wanting to try everything on the menu. \u00a0Dishes that stand out: Polpo Alla Griglia (grilled wild octopus), every pasta (homemade in house), and the lovely Pesce e Crostacei which allows you to customize the preparation and sauce of your choice of fish. \u00a0The dishes are gorgeous, the lighting romantic, and the music is hip and lounge appropriate. \u00a0Try the specials as they always knock it out of the park. \u00a0We have since become regulars here!! \u00a0The owner Francesco greets guests personally and is truly a wonderful host. \u00a0Definitely a must for fine dining in Westchester county, perhaps the best italian around!\"<\/p> <p>And one more said, \"I cannot even describe the amazing experience my boyfriend and I had at this restaurant. \u00a0If you want a true dining experience without an uptight, cold atmosphere, Massa' is the place to go! This restaurant runs a seamless operation - Vinny being the manager, and our server, couldn't have been better!

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions.

The style you agonized over last year may already look dated compared to the new hotness. And feature development is so rapid that even the simplest UI can turn into a complicated mess of functionality overnight. This brings us to the inevitable redesign. If you've ever worked on one, you're probably familiar with high stakes, massive amounts of uncertainty, and constant fear of user backlash. Join us to learn about a new approach to redesigning that mitigates the risks and guarantees you'll win over the hearts of your users.<\/p> <p>Vanessa Koch is a product designer and design manager at Asana. She led their recent redesign, which launched last fall to critical acclaim and 99% opt-in rate.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Sam Goertler is a product manager at Asana.

Fellow lawyer and blogger Noah Potter and cannabis activist Doug Greene will help me lead a conversation on possible future projects. Doug\u2019s background in advocacy is extensive. He is the Legislative Director of Empire State NORML and Patient Advocacy Coordinator of GITA.<\/p> <p><br\/>We envision this event, which we hope is a first of many,\u00a0as a meeting of activists that want to take practical steps in New York to help normalize and legalize psychedelics. But at this point, we're simply brainstorming.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Example topics of conversation and potential advocacy projects are:<\/i><\/p> <p>1. A petition for clemency for those in prison for possession of psychedelic substances. This petition would further highlight the draconian nature of the drug war in general, while focusing on its impact on the psychedelic community.<\/p> <p>2. There\u2019s an FDA process dedicated to the rescheduling of these substances at the federal level, but is there room for an independent path at the state\/local level? Mirroring the cannabis movement where states legalized marijuana in contravention of federal law, are there steps we could take in NY? Examples would be obtaining local political support for the establishment of psychedelic therapy centers to combat substance abuse and PTSD.<\/p> <p>3. A list of New Yorkers that would be willing to come out of the psychedelic closet. This \u201cout\u201d list would serve to reduce the stigma associated with psychedelic use.<\/p> <p>Note, this is a brainstorming session, and an opportunity to gauge membership interest for this sort of advocacy work. No concrete steps will be taken at this meeting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there, and to hearing your ideas.<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Danny, Doug, and Noah<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Psychedelic-Society-of-Brooklyn\/events\/227941656\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"Advocacy Brainstorming Meeting","id":"227941656","time":1454027400000,"updated":1454035500000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432047156000,"name":"The Psychedelic Society of Brooklyn","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18609289,"urlname":"The-Psychedelic-Society-of-Brooklyn","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"490 Hudson Street  between Christopher & Grove","name":"PS3","lon":-74.005974,"id":11204482,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452012145000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come dance with us\u00a0at an\u00a0event to introduce\u00a0you to Modern Western Square Dancing.\u00a0 You will learn lots of the basic steps right off, and have an amazing evening of fun\u00a0with us.\u00a0 Should you want more\u00a0of a\u00a0challenge, and to learn the steps leading to\u00a0Mainstream level, you can begin classes on February 2.\u00a0 Either way, Times Squares promises you a\u00a0party with\u00a0lots of dancing and lots of laughs.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Times-Squares-Square-Dance-Club\/events\/227860323\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Dance Party","id":"227860323","time":1454027400000,"updated":1454094932000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357364756000,"name":"Times Squares Square Dance Club","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":6495772,"urlname":"Times-Squares-Square-Dance-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Square Dance Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"189 Graham Avenue","name":"New Mexico Place","lon":-73.943634,"id":24262457,"state":"NY","lat":40.708504,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.76446032524,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450493472000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Taco-Thursdays\/events\/227510404\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"New Mexico Place (189 Graham Avenue)","id":"227510404","time":1454027400000,"updated":1454136557000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1437261607000,"name":"Taco Thursdays (& Tuesdays)","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18750919,"urlname":"Taco-Thursdays","group_lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Taquitos"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"167 Bleecker St (between Sullivan and Thompson)","name":"The Village Lantern","lon":-74.005974,"id":11438772,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439840936000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>FREE LIVE COMEDY SHOW<\/b> <b>at the Village Lantern, right in the heart of historic Greenwich Village!!

It tracks his artistic evolution from the 1930s and early 1940s, when he made loosely figurative images based on mythical or primeval themes, to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when he pioneered the radical abstractions for which he is best known by pouring and dripping paint onto canvas or paper. The exhibition features approximately 50 works\u2014paintings, drawings, and prints\u2014from the Museum\u2019s collection, which is unparalleled in the breadth, depth, and quality of its Pollock holdings. Among the paintings on view is\u00a0<b><i>One: Number 31, 1950\u00a0(1950)<\/i><\/b>, arguably Pollock\u2019s greatest masterpiece, and one of his largest canvases. Exceedingly rare and little-known engravings, lithographs, screenprints, and drawings are also included, highlighting an underappreciated side of one of the most important and influential American artists of the 20th century. By bringing together works made using a range of materials and techniques\u2014both traditional and unorthodox\u2014the exhibition underscores the relentless experimentation and emphasis on process that was at the heart of Pollock\u2019s creativity.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/2\/9\/600_445350761.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"PLEASE NOTE: The East 54th Street entrance is used on Free Fridays.

Hope you all enjoyed the holidays. Apologies for the very sparse meetups over the last year or so. We have all been tied down with the usual New York fast life but looking to change things in 2016 and make the meet-ups regular and planned out way earlier.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For 2016's first meetup, we will convene at The Press Box bar near the UN. Date is Friday January 29th.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>As usual, the social is very informal, and simply a means to meet other Kenyan ( and friends of Kenya) professionals, students, and residents in the city. There are no formalities or speeches. We all wear name tags and simply network. For those of you who might have not attended, it is a great experience. We also usually invite the Kenyan representatives to the UN Mission and the ambassadors have joined us a few times.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Looking forward to meeting you and feel free to bring a friend along.

For the 100,000 people who visit The Museum at FIT each year, the museum works to create exhibitions, programs, and publications that are both entertaining and educational. The mission of the Museum is to advance knowledge of fashion through exhibitions, programs and publications. Founded in 1969, the Museum was installed in the current building in 1974, and exhibitions began to be presented in 1975.<\/p> <p><b>Current Exhibition:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Denim: Fashion's Frontier<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/2\/0\/600_445634368.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Denim has become one of the world's most beloved fabrics. According to anthropologist Daniel Miller, \"On any given day, nearly half the worlds population is in jeans.\" The cultural significance of this has yet to be fully determined. Denim: Fashion's Frontier explores the dynamic history of denim and its relationship with high fashion from the 19th century to the present. The exhibition traces denim from its origins in work wear of the 19th century, through its role as a symbol of counterculture rebellion in America, to its acceptance into mainstream culture. It culminates with the arrival of blue jeans as luxury items during the late 20th century, and denim's subsequent deconstruction by contemporary designers through postmodern pastiche and experimentation.<\/p> <p>Alongside this chronology, Denim: Fashion's Frontier highlights important points of engagement between high fashion and denim that are often left out of typical denim histories. Themes addressed include the role of advertising in creating popular mythologies, as well as issues of distressing, connoisseurship, and environmental concerns. The goal is to shed new light on one of the worlds most popular types of clothing, and to explore how a particular style of woven cotton has come to dominate the clothing industry.<\/p> <p><b>Reference Links:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fitnyc.edu\/museum\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.fitnyc.edu\/museum\/<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-museum-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-museum-new-york<\/a><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER:<br\/><\/b>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

It can be done through past life regression in hypnosis. If you believe<br\/>in reincarnation and feel that a past life is affecting you in this lifetime then a past life regression may help you find the answers. Hypnosis is a natural altered state. In hypnosis you relax enough to go into the subconscious where the memories are stored. A hypnotist induces hypnosis and guides the client to a deep relaxed state. There is always a reason to go back to a past life. It can be to find your life purpose, heal, and fix relationships, un-block fears and so much more. People can experience past lives a little differently. For some it can be very vivid like a movie, others get flashes, some just sense or hear what is going on. You remember everything that goes on in the past life regression. Some people get names, places and time periods. The most important thing is to listen to the messages that come through in a past life regression. Trust that the subconscious takes you where you need to go to.

I plan to spend the night dancing with the community that has brought me so much joy since I first discovered it several years ago. I'd be honored if you'd join me.\"<\/i><br\/>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p><b>DETAILS:<\/b><\/p> <p>No need to bring a partner! Friday Night Blues NYC is a social dance; we dance with strangers, we dance with our friends... we want to dance with you! Our crowd can typically bring in anywhere from 30 to 80 dancers on any given evening.<\/p> <p>The lesson costs $10, and the dance is $16 (sorry, cash only).

As students construct this first project, they are exposed to important programming building blocks called Computational Thinking Patterns. Once students learn these patterns, they will reuse and build upon them to create subsequent games and simulations. The second step employs a gentle-slope of increasingly complex challenges to keep students in the Flow. The third step involves validated methods for actually assessing the computational thinking skills students have gained.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ashok is Assistant Professor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oldwestbury.edu\">SUNY College at Old Westbury<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Leigh Ann DeLyser -\u00a0Using Multiple Exit Points for Differentiation<\/b><\/p> <p>NYC public schools are challenging because classrooms contain vastly diverse groups of students. Encouraging engagement and preparing lessons at the appropriate difficulty for all students can be extraordinarily challenging. Through this session, Leigh Ann will present pedagogical and assessment practices that can help effectively engage all learners, without requiring teachers to create completely different assignments for each student. The multiple exit point strategy helps teachers value not only low-level skills, but also creative thinking and higher levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.<\/p> <p><br\/>Leigh Ann is Director of Education and Research at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csnyc.org\">CSNYC<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Sean Pawelec &amp; Matt Boyle -\u00a0#CS4All: What It's Like to Teach in NYCDOE Computer Science Programs<\/b><\/p> <p>Sean and Matt from the Renaissance School in East Harlem will talk about their experiences in NYC DOE computer science programs through the lens of a lesson.

The lesson will cover\u00a0how conditional can be used to generatively create computer graphics.

Green-blazes continue north 2 miles to SunfishPond. Some previous trail washouts may require several more fordings. We may take a route via Holly Spring \/ AT.

The first overlook is reached after a half-mile ascent of about two hundred feet, and grants views of Arrow Island and Mt. Minsi from about five hundred feet above the Delaware River. The second half of the ascent is considerably more difficult, and includes a steep, switchback scramble over boulders-but it is worth it! The second overlook may offer the finest view of the Gap and the surrounding area to be found in the park.<\/p> <p>The Red-dot trail gives way shortly thereafter to the Blue-blazed trail, which is much more easily traversed. In a mile and a half, the blue gives way to a green blaze, and then to the white blaze of the Appalachian Trail, which will bring visitors back to the parking lot. Since the view is simply too good to pass up, using the Blue-blazed trail to go up AND down is an alternative to the Red-dot.<\/p> <p><br\/>Many say Winter is the best time to hike Mt. Tammany at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s one of the park\u2019s most popular hikes, and it\u2019s easy to see why. All the work of this 1,400-foot climb is in the quick, but semi-steep trek to Tammany, which offers a beautiful, sweeping view of the sparkling blue Delaware River and the sea of white snow peaking out from the brown barren trees on the gentle rolling hills surrounding Pennsylvania\u2019s Mt. Minsi. Painted green, the view is equally breathtaking in the summer.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.dailyrecord.com\/greenlife\/files\/2010\/02\/Dunnfield-Creek-Falls.jpg\">&lt;\/a&gt; Dunnfield Creek tumbles down rocks near the end of this hike.<\/a><\/p> <p>From the lot, we will take the red-dot Tammany Trail up steep wooden stairs as the cars whizzing by on Route 80 become smaller and smaller. When we get to the top, we'll follow the blue-blazed trail, which takes us along a ridge overlooking New Jersey\u2019s Highlands region and through quiet woods down to Dunnfield Creek, which boasts two picturesque waterfalls.<\/p> <p><br\/>The initial hike, just under four miles, can take about 2+ hours depending on the conditions.<\/p> <p>Wearing layers plus a shell, gloves and a hat. The shell and gloves may came off early, during the uphill stretch to Tammany, but you may be putting them back on when we reach the windy summit. This is why layering in cold weather is essential.<\/p> <p>The snow should be pretty well packed down along the trail. I recommend Yak Trax \/ MicroSpikes \/ IceTrekkers to help prevent any slips.<\/p> <p><b>__________________________<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NOTICE: By attending an event you are agreeing that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AT ALL TIMES.
