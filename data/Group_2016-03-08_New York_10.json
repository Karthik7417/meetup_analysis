I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":131857822,"name":"Marthe","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/highres_242952651.jpeg","photo_id":242952651,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/member_242952651.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/thumb_242952651.jpeg"}},"members":139,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

March sessions will be gentle, getting-back-into-it, is-it-for-me affairs. I am not a coach and I am of intermediate standard, just keen to pass on knowledge and learn from others.

With over 1,800 current members internationally, the opportunities and benefits of membership continue to attract people from all over the globe. In the spring of 2004, Birmingham, Alabama became the first city to form a local chapter. In the year following, additional chapters were formed. The process of local involvement and self determination is an important benefit of membership.<\/p>\n<p>Member participation in national conferences held annually across the country has provided the practical fabric of a rapidly growing network of diverse grant professionals. Each year, GPA's conference provide timely and informative workshops, round-table discussions, member receptions, funder panels, vendor exhibits and the popular individual proposal review sessions are all available to registered attendees. Additionally, the opportunity to network with peers from around the globe, listen to the keynote address, and participate in the annual membership meetings ensure that possibilities abound at this exciting event.<\/p>\n<p>Fostering a constant critical eye on the current state of the craft, the GPA Journal (published annually) provides a forum for book and article reviews, discussions on best practices, and scholarly examination of the state of the profession. The member\u2019s electronic forum provides another venue for the exchange of ideas, issues, methodologies and other relevant discourse on a member-to-member basis.<\/p>\n<p>For the long term, GPA continues to lead the efforts to establish a formal credentialing process.

The purpose of our meetings is to foster community among people using Hadoop in production, provide an opportunity to learn about interesting and relevant use cases, and hear about some challenges of using Hadoop in production and how people address them. Meetings will be held in NYC on a regular basis. Pepperdata delivers predictability, increasing performance, and visibility for business-critical Hadoop jobs on existing clusters running multiple applications. Pepperdata's software makes every Hadoop node more efficient, allowing companies to run more jobs on the existing infrastructure. Pepperdata was founded in 2012 by Sean Suchter and Chad Carson, former Yahoo executives whose groups were the first two users of Hadoop in production even before it was called Hadoop.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/highres_244267464.jpeg","photo_id":244267464,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/member_244267464.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/thumb_244267464.jpeg"}},"members":557,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.

So far we have averaged around 2 per week. <br><\/p>\n<p>2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue. <br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity.

A lot of groups seem to do the same activities or go to the same places over and over again. I will find new and exciting places to try that have good write ups and reviews. That being said, I am always open to member suggestions, so please send me suggestions of places you want to go. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you join the group and we can have a lot of fun exploring the amazing NYC food scene.

To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment.

Unlike most meetup groups, where the organizer manages the meetups and communication, here at MeetOut NYC - you can connect with like-minded individuals from our meetup groups and have them join you for your activities (drinks after work, grab a bite at Chelsea Pier, coffee, last minute playdates for moms\/dads, quick run through central park, art exhibit, an opening at the MET, and anything else you can think of). Join Us - MeetOut NYC. In-addition to the meetup events we will hold, we will use the accompanying MeetOut app (meetoutapp.com), to give you the flexibility to further connect with the people in this group. This is a free app that the organizer (me) created to help foster greater engagement within our meetup groups. We are staying true to the Meetup mission and allow our members greater collaboration among themselves based on common interests and activities. This is a Meetup group first and foremost, and we will follow all meetup guidelines and policies.

Our brain tapping experiences are designed to make you feel part of something bigger so you can share what you already know, express it, and turn it into something you will be proud of.

Key word - You. Although you can hire us to do some of the work for you, we love to lead the horse to the water so it can drink for life (if you catch our drift). Feel free to ask us what our extra services are!<\/p>\n<p><b>Are these group meetings?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Guess what - this is anything you want it to be. For the love of networking you'll see us set up brainstorming sessions, but most of our members prefer to schedule a one-on-one meeting to be selfish and talk all about themselves for an hour (which we 100% love and encourage). If you like to pick brains and see how others work, group meet-ups are for you, but if you want to get the most of your meetings, one-on-ones are perfect to hone in on what you want so you can leave with tons of material to work with.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where do you meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our New York staple is any Think Coffee shop. We've also met at hotel lounges, and other coffee bars. Feel free to share some of your favorite spots to meet. We love shaking it up!<\/p>\n<p>Best part, you can schedule phone calls. Most of our super-humans have jobs and would like to set up a call when it's most convenient for them. This way you make the most of your time, and can handle business at home in your PJ's and easily jump in and out of our meeting. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What does it cost and how do we pay?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Best $30 you will spend on yourself for an hour of coaching.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All meetings will be finalized once you pay through&nbsp;Paypal&nbsp;(katiegonzalez@bellsouth.net).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we meet in person and you do not have&nbsp;Paypal, cash is&nbsp;accepted.<\/p>\n<p><b>How effective is this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>One meeting is inspiring.

Recently our country has been facing so many identity crises. Especially when it comes to racism, our broken justice system, police and state-sanctioned violence against men and women of color and in general, discrimination against LGBTQ, endless wars, occupied people and income inequality.

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/highres_244821015.jpeg","photo_id":244821015,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/member_244821015.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/thumb_244821015.jpeg"}},"members":29,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

You'll also learn natural running form, helping you become stronger, healthier, and more injury resistant. Look out PR's, here you come! And if you've ever been injured, mindful running will help you come back faster, with a more relaxed and super-charged body, mind and soul.

Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br><\/b><b>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English? <br>3.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

I consider myself a queer a a result of how I dress and interact with the gender I am attracted to. In being trans, I am particularly interested in talking with trans folk who are truly \"open\", and thus not black and white, and thus, who would be open to discussing more of our estate in being trans, and what it means, and why and what we feel.

Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

Join me and a wonderful group of friendly, non-judgmental men for some shopping at the Grand Army Farmers Market, followed by a picnic in Prospect Park. This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!).

These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting.

Depending on the sport of the day, one or two Dads will be responsible for keeping an eye on the kids for very short periods.  We will play with frequent substitutions to rotate playing and babysitting.

Just by showing up and paying the entry free you are supporting a local musician or band. Typically cover charges go directly to a performing act once a minimum threshold has been met by the host venue.

By forming a group we can give selected local acts eager for new fans an opportunity to play for larger audience.<br><\/p>\n<p>In the future, Rock &amp; Effect NYC will be looking to partner with local music arts charitable organizations in combination with local venues to provide fundraising opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><b>How can I join the group?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Joining is easy.

Whether your condition is now chronic or if you're making a full recovery, we can share stories with each other between trips to specialists and physical therapy.

We have a particular interest in fostering positive mental wellness among--and assimilating insights and wisdom from--individuals with lived experience of mental health issues and extreme states. (We use the term \"extreme states\u201d here to recognize and include those who do not necessarily believe that extreme modes of awareness should automatically be viewed as health problems.)<\/p>\n<p>Most of the gatherings being hosted under the Propeller banner right now are what we call \"creative safe-spaces\" and are for individuals with past or present experience of mental health issues\/extreme states only.&nbsp;<span>Propeller's creative safe-spaces reject the problem\/problem-solving framework that tends to guide most traditional support groups, aiming instead to cultivate positive mental wellness by fostering positive forces such as community, connection, creativity, and fun. This is done in part through the offering of (what we at least hope are) interesting and engaging creative\/creative collaborative activities such as \"Exquisite Corpse\" (a surrealist drawing game), collaborative audio collage, Dada poetry, and the raising of funds for just causes through the creation of sellable art. It is worth noting that while there is a focus on creativity and creative collaboration at our creative safe-spaces, there is 0% need for anyone who comes to be artistically skilled, and everything is 100% laid back in terms of whether you want to participate in activities, make things on your own, or just hang out!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>At the end of each Propeller creative safe-space there are opportunities to make requests and offers to other Propeller frequenters (r<span>equesting help with cleaning your apartment or offering to lend someone a book, for example) as well as opportunities to set up mutually supportive arrangements (agreeing to be somebody's \"gym buddy\", cooking partner, etc...). There will also be opportunities to announce events or projects that you see as being relevant to Propeller's mission and spirit. If you are planning on attending a Propeller creative safe-space, you may want to do some thinking ahead of time about what you might want to offer, request, or announce, or about what kinds of mutually supportive arrangements you might want to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Please know that you do not need to be particularly in need of support to come to a Propeller creative safe-space.

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit.

Chefs come out to introduce the dishes and share the stories behind them Members get to try lots of dishes, learn about the food they're enjoying, and share an awesome social dining experience with new people who love food as much as you do :)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join us and let's reinvent the traditional restaurant experience together!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/3\/8\/highres_437219192.jpeg","photo_id":437219192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/3\/8\/600_437219192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/3\/8\/thumb_437219192.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185295940,"name":"Nat Gelb","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/f\/5\/highres_244588917.jpeg","photo_id":244588917,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/f\/5\/member_244588917.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/f\/5\/thumb_244588917.jpeg"}},"members":457,"name":"Communal Feasts at Top NYC Restaurants!","id":18582345,"state":"NY","urlname":"tastingcollective","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Food Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pearl River","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431045539000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"pop-culture","name":"Pop Culture","id":20884},{"urlkey":"singles-20s-30s","name":"Singles 20's  & 30's","id":23012},{"urlkey":"20s-and-30s","name":"20's and 30's","id":29541},{"urlkey":"beer-lovers","name":"Beer Lovers","id":46593},{"urlkey":"dining-out-with-new-friends","name":"Dining Out With New Friends","id":61653},{"urlkey":"games-party-games-social-games-strategy-games","name":"Games: Party Games, Social Games, Strategy Games","id":76292}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rockland-20s-and-30s-Social-Meetup\/","rating":4.89,"description":"<p>I want to inspire healthy relationships and friendships between the people in this group.

I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned. They should be banned&nbsp; now.\u201d Rosemary Dreger Carey, an organizer for 350NJ, says, \u201cTransporting highly volatile oil by any means--train, pipeline or barge--is inherently unsafe. And it is unnecessary because we have the technology and natural resources right here in New Jersey to switch to clean, safe renewable energy.\u201d The Danger Zone March is one of six grassroots events happening across New Jersey and New York to oppose risky and unnecessary area fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Pilgrim Pipeline and Port Ambrose LNG (liquid natural gas) facility.&nbsp;

There are many forms of violence that we deal with, directly or indirectly, every day. Physical violence\/threats, racial violence and discrimination, sexual\/gender violence, and economic violence are probably the ones most clearly recognized, but there are more subtle forms as well (psychological, moral violence.) The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value. Recognizing the link between personal change and social change, The Community offers readings, exercise, and seminars that help us to align the way we think, feel and act, overcome the lack of meaning, and build a less violent and more human world.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10325289,"name":"Dennis Redmond","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/highres_246139178.jpeg","photo_id":246139178,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/member_246139178.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/thumb_246139178.jpeg"}},"members":23,"name":"The Community of Nonviolence Sunnyside","id":18590121,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Community-of-Nonviolence-Sunnyside","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431367471000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"new-experiences","name":"New Experiences","id":34477},{"urlkey":"nyc","name":"NYC","id":39508},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"try-new-experiences","name":"Try New Experiences","id":278391}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hooplas\/","rating":0,"description":"Let's get together for affordable and fun events &amp; activities in New York City.

So working with the Moon provides us with an opportunity to take the time to create SACRED SPACE for ourselves. It\u2019s necessary. There is something so powerful when women come together to support each other on their journey, in the hopes and dreams. We are healed, we are nurtured, we feel comforted and understood. Moreover, when you share sacred space with other women, you magnify the power of your intentions and you energetically create a web of support for not only your circle of women friends but with women everywhere. There is no judgment or criticism present. We are able to listen wholeheartedly to what each woman has to say, holding her in support and compassion. A circle also allows that everyone within it, is equal. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honored, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.

A few days later he found himself in the military camp, T2, outside of Goma, where he met five boys being held prisoner by the national army. The boys had been child soldiers, taken from their homes and forced to fight for rebel groups, until one night they escaped and ran to the national army for refuge. Now they were being treated as enemies of the state.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>He spent the day with the boys, trading stories laughter and tears. One boy told him of children too small to carry guns being sent to the front-lines, armed with only a whistle. Sean wrote to a few friends of this single story of a single day, who then forwarded it around the world. Thousands of strangers wrote back asking: what can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fallingwhistles.com\">Falling Whistles<\/a> is a non-profit organization campaigning for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our goal is to create a sustainable peace and to help local entrepreneurs rebuild their war-torn community. We work with Congolese visionaries, leaders creating progress in business, education, health and culture to create sustainable jobs and a sustainable economy. We raise our voices to advocate for peace and to help end one of the deadliest wars of our time. The movement and coalition though builds upon the involvement and commitment of whistleblowers from all over the world, and this is where you come in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the start of the first NYC Whistler Society. We join a global network of local chapters dedicated to whistleblowing and together, we will start the conversation here in New York.

Gnosis is as ancient as life itself and is not bound by any one culture, religion, or people. Classically, the teachings of Gnosis were hidden from the public and guarded by an elite priesthood in every civilization, however, due to the age in which we live, these teaching have been made public for all to know. Join us to discover, learn, and practice this profound science in order to reach your own Self- Realization and Liberation. Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering.

They have things for singles, alternative lifestyles, and every other group you can think of.&nbsp; So why not have something for Christian families? We can fellowship with one another while we're there, and have more fun than any entertainer can provide. We can do short trips, long trips, far trips, or close trips. We can even do something as simple and inexpensive as going to a state park together.&nbsp; Cruises are always fun too. So, if this sounds like something you'd be interested in being a part of, by all means please join.<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11548188,"name":"Frank","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/highres_9197283.jpeg","photo_id":9197283,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/member_9197283.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/thumb_9197283.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"NY Christian Families Travel Group","id":18604456,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Christian-Families-Travel-Group","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Christian Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431888724000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"childrens-groups","name":"Children's Groups","id":16897},{"urlkey":"art-classes","name":"Art Classes","id":18268},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"childrens-art-education","name":"Childrens Art Education","id":25970},{"urlkey":"families-with-young-children","name":"Families With Young Children","id":26156},{"urlkey":"arts-crafts-for-kids","name":"Arts & Crafts for Kids","id":26389},{"urlkey":"childrens-activities","name":"Children's Activities","id":29313},{"urlkey":"kids-art","name":"kids art","id":1198062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Eckford-Street-Studio-Family-Open-Studio\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Family Open Studio takes place most Sunday mornings from 9:30-11:30, with a different drawing, painting, sculpture or collage project prepared each session, interpreted for tots and school aged kids. parents will be joining their kids doing art activities!

I do not instruct women in getting and keeping a man. Rather I focus on men and examine some of the reasons many are not suitable for dating and marriage. To assist women in the evaluation process I have designed a rating system laid out in my dating guide called \"The Five Star Man\". This system reveals (5) major areas of stability and discusses each in full detail. This rating system has proven to be very effective by those who have used it. The primary goal of the meetings is to give women a new sense of direction, purpose, and self worth, while at the same time equipping them with the tools needed to identify the man who is truly deserving.","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":63551342,"name":"trudy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/6\/e\/highres_246309070.jpeg","photo_id":246309070,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/6\/e\/member_246309070.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/6\/e\/thumb_246309070.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"Dating Advice Meetup","id":18610580,"state":"NY","urlname":"Dating-Advice-Meetup","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Daters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432086024000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"abundance","name":"Abundance","id":15842},{"urlkey":"abundance-and-prosperity","name":"Abundance And Prosperity","id":15942},{"urlkey":"creating-abundance","name":"Creating Abundance","id":15948},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Prosperity-and-Abundance-Workshop-meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This meet up is for individuals who knows that they have what it takes but need help accessing their inner power.

Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

To facilitate dinner-table discussions and to ensure that everyone is able to taste and retaste all the wines, attendance will be capped at 10 men per dinner.
