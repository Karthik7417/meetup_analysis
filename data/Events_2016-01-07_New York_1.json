The fact is, contemporary filmmakers working in Italy are making some of the most impactful, resonant, and awarded movies of this new century. At the heart of many of these films is one studio, Rai Cinema. Celebrating many decades of support for visionary directors, the Rai Cinema catalog is filled with essential titles past and present. This selection of 10 films from the past 15 years gives a strong indication that future generations of cinephiles will look back at this era with nostalgia of their own. Because they are also all recent additions to MoMA\u2019s collection, it is certain that they will be as beautiful to behold then as they are now.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/d\/c\/600_444547132.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Sacro GRA<\/b><\/p> <p>2013. Italy. Directed by Gianfranco Rosi.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter the India of Varanasi\u2019s boatmen, the American desert of the dropouts, and the Mexico of the killers of drugtrade, Gianfranco Rosi has decided to tell the tale of a part of his own country, roaming and filming for over two years in a minivan on Rome\u2019s giant ring road\u2014the Grande Raccordo Anulare, or GRA\u2014to discover the invisible worlds and possible futures harbored in this area of constant turmoil. Elusive characters and fleeting apparitions emerge from the background of the winding zone: a nobleman from the Piemonte region and his college student daughter sharing a one-room efficiency in a modern apartment building along the GRA; a botanist making audio recordings of the interiors of palm trees to detect and then poison the insects that are devouring them like a plague; a modern day cigar-smoking prince doing gymnastics on the roof of his castle, surrounded by the sea of new apartment buildings proliferating around him; a paramedic in an ambulance eternally on duty treating car accident victims along the vast road; and an eel fisherman living on a houseboat beneath an overpass along the Tiber River. Far from the iconic sites of Rome, the GRA is a repository of stories of those at the edges of the ever-expanding universe of the capital city\u201d (70th Venice International Film Festival notes).<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Winner of the Golden Lion at the 2013 Venice Film Festival<\/b>\u2014the first documentary to win that honor.

Let's get together\u00a0every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations.

You will see your personal Dreams MATRIX during\u00a0this workshop to help you\u00a0connect to the future you want\u00a0by first defining it. We are never taught to see how the entire system of our goals and dreams fit or avoid fitting together. During the workshop we will move goals around like a jigsaw puzzle pieces until everything fits together. Lastly, you will learn to auto-imprint your defined dreams and goals into your brain-mind system. Plus many other unique processes are used to\u00a0create the future you really want.<\/p> <p>Note onsite payment is $20.00 and advanced payment is $15.00<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/live-program-design-your-full-spectrum-future-tickets-19909393532\">I WANT TO ATTEND<\/a><\/p> <p>LOCATION<\/p> <p>Thursday December 10<\/p> <p>Time 7:00 pm To 7:45<\/p> <p>Followed by the \"DESIGN YOUR FULL SPECTRUM FUTURE\" Program<\/p> <p>Location: Ripley-Grier\u00a0<\/p> <p>520 8th Avenue 17 FL\u00a0<\/p> <p>Between 36th and 37th street\u00a0<\/p> <p>New York, NY 10018\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please be on time, allow for traffic and delays in your travel plans.<\/p> <p>Take the Right Hand side elevator to the 17 Floor<\/p> <p>Walk though the glass doors and turn left and at the end\u00a0<\/p> <p>turn right then left to the end of the hall<\/p> <p>NOTE: If there is a ROOM CHANGE consult the front desk.<\/p> <p>Room: 17 M<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/3\/1\/600_444881521.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Cognitive Artist &amp; Stylist James Murdock operates a boutique-consulting and coaching practice.

As the people that build these systems, we have a social responsibility to consider how these systems affect people, and furthermore, we should do whatever we can to prevent these systems and models from perpetuating some of the prejudice and bias that exist in our society today.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this talk I intend to cover some of the recommendation systems that have gone wrong across various industries, and attempt to provide some solutions for prevention. First and foremost among these is awareness, but approaches involving interpretable models, using ensemble models to separate features that shouldn't interact, and designing test data sets for capturing bias will also be explored.<\/p> <p><i><b>Many thanks to Meetup.com for hosting this talk, and for providing food and beverages!<\/b><\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"11th Floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Data-Science\/events\/226998694\/","yes_rsvp_count":190,"name":"When Recommendation Systems Go Bad","id":"226998694","time":1449792000000,"updated":1449855870000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357842112000,"name":"NYC Data Science","group_lon":-74,"id":6592232,"urlname":"NYC-Data-Science","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Data Scientists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443629166000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Psychic or not - here we go!

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

In 2013, over 15,000 people died from heroin or prescription opioid overdoses in the United States. Addiction is not only deadly, it is also costly; drug-related crime and healthcare expenses cost Americans over 700 billion dollars per year, according to The National Institute on Drug Abuse. Genetics and environmental factors have been shown to contribute to individuals\u2019 propensity to become dependent on drugs of abuse, with few available treatment options. For these reasons, understanding the basic science underlying the trajectory that leads individuals to compulsive drug use and addiction is very important. These issues will be discussed in an engaging talk by Dr. Charlotte Wincott, addiction scientist at Rockefeller University and Vice President of Know Science.<\/p> <p>Dr. Charlotte Wincott, Scientist at the Rockefeller University, holds a B.S. degree from Virginia Commonwealth University in psychology and a Ph.D. from New York University in neuroscience, where she studied the role of glutamate receptors in learning, memory, and reward-related behavior. She is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at The Rockefeller University where she is thrilled to have the opportunity to study heroin addiction. As an undergraduate at VCU, Charlotte served as President and Event Coordinator of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and was active in her community, spearheading numerous service projects to raise awareness for suicide prevention and domestic abuse. Charlotte also organized a variety of fundraising drives to benefit The Virginia Holocaust Museum, the homeless, and local food banks. Charlotte has been an instructor of chemistry, biology, neuroscience, and psychology and currently teaches at Fordham University in addition to conducting her research studies at Rockefeller. In Charlotte\u2019s free time, she enjoys spending time with her young son Wolfgang and is also a musician, having recorded multiple albums\/EPs in her lifetime.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Nevins St. stop on 2,3,4 or 5 train","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Biohackers\/events\/227075384\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"The Science of Drug Addiction: Human Behavior Under the Influence","id":"227075384","time":1449792000000,"updated":1449804366000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369658080000,"name":"Brooklyn Biohackers","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":8659672,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Biohackers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Biohackers, Geeks, DIYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"5 Hanover Square - Floor 25","name":"Fullstack Academy of Code","lon":-74.009552,"id":23490956,"state":"NY","lat":40.704674,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":3.30174589157,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449261360000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/nodeschool.io\">NodeSchool.io<\/a><\/b> is a series of open source workshops focused on learning essential skills of Node.js and JavaScript.<\/p> <p>Meet others learning JavaScript, pair program on workshops suited for beginner and intermediate students, ask experienced <a href=\"http:\/\/fullstackacademy.com\">Fullstack Academy<\/a> mentors for help.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Attendees can try any workshop and are encouraged to pair up with others of similar skill-level.

Thousands of the refugees were held at the Atlit detention camp far better than camps they had come from, but an internment camp nonetheless. On October 10, 1945, special forces fighters from the Haganah (the underground Jewish military organization) broke into the camp and released 200 detainees. Diamant relates this history through the eyes of four young women with diverse wartime experiences. Shayndel was a Zionist resistance fighter in Poland. Tedi, a Dutch blond, hid on a farm. Leonie served as a prostitute for the SS in Paris. And Zorah was in Auschwitz. Although the history is compelling, the real interest lies in the way Diamant shows these women learning to go on forming new bonds, rediscovering simple daily pleasures, coming to terms with the past.\u00a0 (Booklist, 2009)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nNovels at Night is\u00a0 a book club for adults 21 years and older who enjoy reading and sharing their opinions about books.

The Animals\u2019 Battalion will be hosting an outreach event outside of the Argentine consulate in NYC. Sin Zoo is involved in a campaign against the Buenos Aires Zoo for its horrifically negligent care of their animals.<br\/><b>The Buenos Aires Zoo is also directly responsible for the deaths of Lara a giraffe who suffocated on a plastic bag, Winner a polar bear who died of heat exhaustion, two sea lions that were forced to perform 15 shows a day, and most recently on Nov. 03, a jack rabbit that literally ran out of the zoo and was killed by a city bus as well as the incarceration and SEVERE NEGLECT (AS IN NOT BEING FED EVERYDAY) of countless animals. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Many of the animals in that zoo exhibit signs of zoochosis- a range of psychological problems associated with animals kept in prolonged captivity. Rocking, swaying, self mutilation, excessive licking, bar biting, pacing, circling, chewing, and neck twisting are all linked with zoochosis, as are abnormal eating habits, such as anorexia.<br\/><b>Fortunately Sin Zoo has a solution- a proposed bill with political backing to shut down the zoo and transform it into a wildlife refuge\/sanctuary where animals can roam freely instead of being incarcerated in cells, where animals that can be rehabilitated will be released back into their native environments and going forward a strict policy which will prohibit bringing in animals that are not indigenous to the country (which is what the zoo does). <\/b><br\/>On Dec. 13 in Buenos Aires, Argentina- Sin Zoo will be hosting un \u201cAbrazo al Zoo\u201d \u2013 an annual demonstration with media coverage that seeks to bring the issue of animal incarceration and neglect to the public as well as reforming zoos nationwide. Last year\u2019s event drew in 1,500. This year with a wildlife refuge bill already on the table, the goal is to draw in even more of the public\u2019s support and get this project underway.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1w3pjFhv2eI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1w3pjFhv2eI<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>This demo is being done outside the consulate to help draw more media attention and awareness to the citizens and government of Argentina as well as to show solidarity with our friends and allies overseas in a most worthy endeavor on behalf of the animals.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/6\/f\/600_444699279.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227172445\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion in solidarity w\/ Sin Zoo against animal neglect in BA Zoo","id":"227172445","time":1449849600000,"updated":1449870632000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448411091000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The tour of Tweed Courthouse includes a discussion of the building's history and architecture.

Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status for Picasso. He approached the medium with the freedom of a self-taught artist, ready to break all the rules. This attitude led him to develop a deep fondness for his sculptures, to which the many photographs of his studios and homes bear witness. Treating them almost as members of his household, he cherished the company of his sculptures and enjoyed re-creating them in a variety of materials and situations. Picasso kept the majority in his private possession during his lifetime. It was only in 1966, through the large Paris retrospective\u00a0<i>Hommage \u00e0 Picasso<\/i>, that the public became fully aware of this side of his work. Following that exhibition, in 1967 The Museum of Modern Art organized<i>\u00a0The Sculpture of Picasso<\/i>, which until now was the first and only exhibition on this continent to display a large number of the artist\u2019s sculptures.<\/p> <p><b>Picasso Sculpture<\/b>\u00a0focuses on the artist\u2019s lifelong work with sculpture, with a particular focus on his use of materials and processes. The exhibition, which features more than 100 sculptures, complemented by selected works on paper and photographs, aims to advance the understanding of what sculpture was for Picasso, and of how he revolutionized its history through a lifelong commitment to constant reinvention. The exhibition is organized in chapters corresponding to the distinct periods during which Picasso devoted himself to sculpture, each time exploring with fresh intensity the modern possibilities of this ancient art form.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"PLEASE NOTE: The East 54th Street entrance is used on Free Fridays.

Five free-spirited teen-aged sisters splash about on the beach with their male classmates. Though their games are merely innocent fun, a neighbor passes by and reports what she considers to be illicit behavior to the girls' family. The family overreacts, removing all \"instruments of corruption,\" like cell phones and computers, and essentially imprisoning the girls, subjecting them to endless lessons in housework in preparation for them to become brides. As the eldest sisters are married off, the younger ones bond together to avoid the same fate. The fierce love between them empowers them to rebel and chase a future where they can determine their own lives in Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven's debut, a powerful portrait of female empowerment.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Younger-Womens-Task-Force\/events\/227136310\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Movie Viewing & Discussion - Mustang ","id":"227136310","time":1449879300000,"updated":1449891827000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445456199000,"name":"YWTF NYC - Younger Women's Task Force of New York City","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":19048844,"urlname":"NYC-Younger-Womens-Task-Force","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"YWTF-ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":16,"distance":11.2834978104,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432121155000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join this wonderful on going FRIDAY EVENING co-ed (men and women) Yoga Class 7:15-8:15pm.\u00a0 This is an adult yoga class for all ages and levels (if interested in children's yoga, please contact me).\u00a0 Beginners are welcome and encouraged to join.\u00a0 NO gym membership required.\u00a0 Reiki is part of the entire class, however specifically given to each person during the quiet beginning of the class (meditation and centering) and at the end of the class during Savasana (the final pose).

Check out this description of their November Intermediate series, which they'll be continuing this week:<\/p> <p>The Intermediate series for the month of November is called \"Dynamic and Creative Social Dancing: Evolving Ideas Over Time.\" What Shoshi and Jeff love about dancing together is how they continually inspire each other to dance creatively, resulting in an entirely unique dance experience every song. In this series, we will explore what it means to be a dynamic and creative social dancer, and how to keep your dancing fresh and interesting every time. You\u2019ll learn some cool new moves and ways of connecting to your partner that naturally lend themselves to creative modification, and become comfortable using this vocabulary on the social dance floor. We\u2019ll give you some specific tools to add more creativity and dynamics to your dancing, and teach you to apply those tools through evolving your ideas over time, and choosing singular moments to make one larger change for major impact. In addition, you will learn to apply these tools to your existing dance vocabulary so you can express and explore your unique dance personalities.<\/p> <p><b>Stepping Out Studios is located at 37 West 26th St, 9th Floor.

And the park is full of so many people you'd think you were in Times Square if it wasn't for the occasional snake slithering across your path or porcupine foraging for food in the bush next to you. Still, this is one of my favorite treks. Let's get out and tackle what is arguably the most scenic hike in the Northeast--Gertrude's Nose in the Shawgunks Mountain Ridge--when it has a bit of a different look, in the early winter when the trails are empty and the solitude makes it feel like you are the only person within 10 miles. Beautiful.<\/p> <p>We're going to follow carriageways and hiking trails to six different breath-taking overlooks. Our journey will take us through dense hemlock forests, over streams, and make us marvel at the crags and crevasses of the Shawgunks Ridge which has extraordinary beauty in its combination of pale, high cliffs and dwarf pines. We'll make our way to the apex of our hike -- Gertrude\u2019s Nose -- a unique geologic formation that looks like the prow of a great ship, with massive blocks of fallen rock below. Witnessing nature\u2019s glory from this special place, overlooking the long rocky ridges and sweeping valleys below makes life worth living.<\/p> <p><i><b>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your organizer is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>The Important Stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022 This is going to be an <b>INTERMEDIATE\u00a0<\/b>hike of about 8.5 miles.

We will be out all day so leave your afternoon\/evening open.<\/p> <p>\u2022 This is a <b>social<\/b> hike, the pace will be moderate -- we'll be stopping to take in the views.

And the park is full of so many people you'd think you were in Times Square if it wasn't for the occasional snake slithering across your path or porcupine foraging for food in the bush next to you. Still, this is one of my favorite treks. Let's get out and tackle what is arguably the most scenic hike in the Northeast--Gertrude's Nose in the Shawgunks Mountain Ridge--when it has a bit of a different look, in the early winter when the trails are empty and the solitude makes it feel like you are the only person within 10 miles. Beautiful.<\/p> <p>We're going to follow carriageways and hiking trails to six different breath-taking overlooks. Our journey will take us through dense hemlock forests, over streams, and make us marvel at the crags and crevasses of the Shawgunks Ridge which has extraordinary beauty in its combination of pale, high cliffs and dwarf pines. We'll make our way to the apex of our hike -- Gertrude\u2019s Nose -- a unique geologic formation that looks like the prow of a great ship, with massive blocks of fallen rock below. Witnessing nature\u2019s glory from this special place, overlooking the long rocky ridges and sweeping valleys below makes life worth living.<\/p> <p><i><b>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your organizer is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>The Important Stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022 This is going to be an\u00a0<b>INTERMEDIATE\u00a0<\/b>hike of about 8.5 miles. You don't need to be a world-class athlete to participate, but you need to be in decent physical shape as this is one of the more challenging treks in area with a bit of elevation gain and a few rock scrambles. We will be out all day so leave your afternoon\/evening open.<\/p> <p>\u2022 This is a\u00a0<b>social\u00a0<\/b>hike, the pace will be moderate -- we'll be stopping to take in the views.

If you don't know what those are, ask. I don't anticipate encountering wintery trail conditions this early in the season but better to be prepared.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 There is a parking fee of $10.00 per car.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Rain cancels the hike.<\/p> <p>\u2022 No guests allowed, sorry.<\/p> <p>\u2022 RSVP\u00a0only if you seriously plan to attend\u00a0as space is limited.<\/p> <p><i><b>How To Get There ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Take the New York State Thruway to Exit 18 (New Paltz). After paying the toll, turn left onto Route 299 and continue west through the Village of New Paltz. When you cross the bridge over the Wallkill River at the west end of the village, continue ahead on Route 299 (do not turn right towards the Mohonk Mountain House). In another 5.5 miles (from the Wallkill River bridge), Route 299 ends at a T intersection with Route 44\/55.

You have to cross a small stream not far from the parking lot. During high water, it might be more challenging to cross the stream. From there the trail wraps around the mountain, and the trail is easy to hike. When you get near the top, there is a small trail off to the right. This small trail will take you to a spring. After the Spring, you will go up a couple small switchbacks, and then the trail will level off. Once you reach the top, there is a nice grassy area with a Ranger Station. There are also picnic tables. The Red Hill Fire Tower will provide you with some nice views. <i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b><a href=\"http:\/\/catskillmountaineer.com\/SD-redhill.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/catskillmountaineer.com\/SD-redhill.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/catskillmountaineer.com\/SD-redhill.html<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/c\/3\/600_444910179.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>WE WILL MEET AT the <a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/76JBW5mxrbM2\">Red Hill Fire Tower Trailhead<\/a> (Old Dinch Rd, Grahamsville, NY)<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>DISTANCE: <\/b>Approximately 3 miles<\/p> <p><b>HIKING PACE:<\/b> up to 1-2 mph<\/p> <p><br\/><b>ESTIMATED HIKE TIME:<\/b> 2-3 hours<\/p> <p><b>DIFFICULTY:<\/b> Easy<\/p> <p><br\/><b>CURRENT WEATHER FORECAST: <\/b>Cloudy with a high of 53 degrees<\/p> <p><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>RECOMMENDED GEAR:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022<b> Shoes with good grip<\/b> - preferably with ankle support<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 <b>A Small Pack<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 <b>Related maps<\/b>, a <b>Compass<\/b> or <b>GPS<\/b>, <b>Water<\/b>, <b>Snacks<\/b>, <b>First Aid<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Windbreaker<\/b>, <b>warm layers<\/b>, <b>hat<\/b>, <b>gloves<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Gaiters<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 <b>Hiking Poles<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>RELATED MAPS:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nynjtc.org\/product\/new-catskill-trails-map-set-maps-hiking-catskills\">New York - New Jersey Trail Conference - Catskills Trails Map Set<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/0\/0\/600_443285632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Catskill Hiking maximum group size limitations.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 A group size limit of 12 people for day hiking off-trail or in wilderness areas is in place.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee).

We have one of the largest pet owner groups on Meetup.com in NYC. However, we simply cannot do indoor Meetups in a space that size.<\/p> <p><br\/>- We've been looking into new venues like privately-owned doggie daycare places, and so far, none I've seen have a play space of comparable size, or are open to the notion of accommodating 30-40 dogs and their owners showing up at once (at least in Manhattan, where we try to remain centrally-based for everyone).<\/p> <p><br\/>- From a \"business standpoint\", this is kind of a big deal in another way:<\/p> <p>A small portion of the proceeds from our winter Meetups have historically funded the group for the remainder of the year, the rest was donated to Animal Haven - any new space we find would need to be both economical and still amenable to sharing any income so we can pay our twice-yearly Meetup.com group subscription, which increased this year due to our group's size to $180\/year.<\/p> <p><br\/>To be perfectly honest, this has all taken us and many other NYC dog Meetup organizers completely by surprise.<\/p> <p><br\/>Animal Haven has been our go-to indoor venue since the group was founded in 2006, and frankly, we hadn't thought of any other options, because we never needed to. They've essentially been woven into our DNA from the start, and gave us no early indication or warning they had plans to move until we approached them several weeks ago to schedule this winter's Meetups. Regardless, they've otherwise been good to us over the years, and we wish them the best of luck with their mission in their new space!<\/p> <p><b>Soooo\u2026for the first time, we're now needing to turn to you, and asking for your ideas to help keep our group alive.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you know of a venue in the city that can meet our needs - doggie daycare, private residence, a business with a large, safe, well-appointed space with dog-friendly owners, etc. - PLEASE get in touch ASAP, so we can check into it, and hopefully get us back on track for the winter sooner rather than later.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>(End of explanation\/apology\/support plea section...now, as for the more immediate future, and that aforementioned global warming thing, back to our regularly scheduled program...)<\/i><\/p> <p>Perhaps you've noticed it's a little hot out for December, huh?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Not only did we globally have the hottest spring, summer, and fall on record, NYC may see the warmest days in December history this weekend.<\/p> <p><br\/>Normally, this could be seen as a bad thing, but right now for us under the circumstances - it's AWESOME\u2026so to celebrate, and make up for lost time a little bit, we'll have not one but TWO Meetups this weekend!<\/p> <p><br\/>#1 will be at the Stuyvesant Dog Run just a few blocks east of Union Square on Saturday, #2 will be uptown at Teddy's Run next to the American Museum of Natural History at 79th and Columbus Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>RSVPs are obviously not required since we're outdoors, but would be greatly appreciated so we can get an idea of who's coming.<\/p> <p>Normally this would be considered very short notice, which we apologize profusely for, but I wanted to ensure the forecasts would be good - so let's enjoy this gift of fall-like temps while we can.<\/p> <p>Happy Holidays to all!<\/p> <p>-Scott<br\/>Fearless Leader\/Alpha Doggie Organizer<br\/>NYC Boston Terrier Meetup Group<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyorkbostonterrier\/events\/227341216\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"December Double Outdoor\/Global Warming Meetup (#1 of 2 this weekend!)","id":"227341216","time":1449946800000,"updated":1449955209000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1142517152000,"name":"The New York Boston Terrier Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":228614,"urlname":"newyorkbostonterrier","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Boston Terriers and their Humans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"On Tickets","name":"Manhattan","lon":-74.005943,"id":24153677,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449695863000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/7WH0Kj9mRuSESFnIR5km\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/7WH0Kj9mRuSESFnIR5km<\/a><\/p> <p>Hi guys, I found a great baking class online and the best part is its 100% vegan!

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p><b>Don't forget:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!<\/p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!<\/p> <p>* To be eligible to play we ask that you sign an annual waiver, which can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1R66HqJ8HCj-nkwQNaTgthJwA8oRJOuNR8yE2FbZuPBg\/viewform\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>* If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers a message.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Rules:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs. Subs should enter mid-game (one of the teams reaches 6 points) and should start the following game. Teams can regulate themselves but let's just make sure everyone plays!<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p><b>***SPECIAL NOTES***<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please do not show up unannounced (without RSVP):<\/b><\/p> <p>This gym is small and 22 is the maximum number of players we can realistically allow. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. If you do show up unannounced we will have to ask you to leave.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Refund Policy:<\/b><\/p> <p>A refund\/credit is available if you change your RSVP at least 24 hours in advance OR, if you change your RSVP within 24 hours, as long as you post a comment on the event page and someone picks up your spot (BOTH are required).<\/p> <p><b>Lastly...<\/b><\/p> <p>Feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your fingernails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.<\/p> <p><b>The Afterparty:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later!\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged\/events\/227160570\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":9900000,"name":"Indoor bball warm up & pickup games","id":"227160570","time":1449957600000,"updated":1449968938000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284011099000,"name":"[New York Co-Ed]  Basketball for the Vertically Challenged","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1703973,"urlname":"Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"bball shorties"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events?and_text=False&country=us&offset=2&city=New+York&format=json&limited_events=False&access_token=69736f5dadf00155f7b410eb017b787f&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&status=past&desc=False","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":7282,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":800,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
