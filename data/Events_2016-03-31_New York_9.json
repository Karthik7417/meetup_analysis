This film, which is one of the first feature documentaries about an Asian American dealing with mental illness, followed Can who became active in the national mental health consumer movement, a civil rights efforts by and for people with mental illnesses. Though he was once an outstanding scholar, Can was forced, due to his mental health issues, to leave the University of Chicago where he was undertaking pre-med studies in 1993.<\/p> <p>During the following 12-year period, Can was hospitalized 6 times, tried more than 20 different medications, entered several clinical drug trials, and underwent 15 electroconvulsive shock treatments. Through it all, Can becomes a mental health recovery advocate - one of the few Asian Americans in the country. Representing the U.S. recovery movement, he attended the World Federation Mental Health Congress in Cairo, Egypt in 2005. Though many Southeast Asians are reluctant to seek psychiatric help in fear of shaming their family, the subject of our film defies many cultural norms, tries numerous healing modalities and fights for his recovery.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Q&amp;A with first generation Korean American filmmaker Pearl J.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Here begin her adventures as she travels magically back and forth in time to visit places both imaginary and real. Finally she comes to understand what has been her special gift to humanity all along.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>For in Beauty, there is beauty. And in beauty, magic. Without our enchanted places, humanity is no more than an upstart ape.

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

We even think anger will help us \u2018win\u2019 our battles, and we rely on it as if it were our trusted friend. The mind of anger, however, leaves a trail of broken relationships, lost opportunities, and painful feelings in its wake. In this class, we will learn to use Buddha\u2019s skillful techniques to remain balanced, flexible and peaceful in the midst of difficult circumstances, thereby overcoming our real enemy, the painful mind of anger itself. It is not enough to simple KNOW anger is a negative force in our lives, we need to see it for ourselves. It is only when we understand the dangers of anger that we actually develop the internal power to oppose and reduce its effects. In this series, we will learn to meditate on anger and patience, discovering how to transform a disturbed, turbulent mind into a peaceful attitude that will enable us to solve our conflicts and leave us feeling peaceful and focused.<\/p> <p>The classes will include instruction, guided meditations and discussion.<\/p> <p>The mind-training methods taught in this course include meditation and meditation break exercises; these are tried-and-tested methods which can be practiced by anyone\u2013regardless of prior experience.<br\/>Give yourself and your loved ones the gift of a patient mind!<\/p> <p>$15 suggested donation.

The stunning and immaculately sited Machu Picchu, the fabled \u201clost city of the Incas,\u201d is South America\u2019s greatest attraction, one that draws ever-increasing numbers of visitors from across the globe. The Incas hid Machu Picchu so high in the clouds that it escaped destruction by the empire-raiding Spaniards, who never found it. It is no longer lost, of course \u2014 we will zip there by high-speed train w\/ option day hike \u2014 but Machu Picchu retains its perhaps unequaled aura of mystery and magic. No longer overgrown with brush, as it was when it was rediscovered in 1911 by the Yale archaeologist and historian Hiram Bingham with the aid of a local farmer who knew of its existence, from below it is still totally hidden from view. The majestic setting the Incas chose for it also remains unchanged: The ruins are nestled in almost brooding Andes Mountains and are frequently swathed in mist<\/p> <p>This will truly be a trip of a life time.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside and Booker T Washington as backups.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 12pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

As investors become more aware of climate and sustainability risks, financial markets are shifting in response. One in every six dollars invested in the United States is screened for environmental, social or governance factors, and the proportion is rising. Green investment strategies \u0096 whether that means investing in mature businesses with optimized environmental footprints or in new business models arising from the demand for sustainable products \u0096 are gaining traction. This panel brings together a diverse array of professionals to discuss the emerging trends and challenges in the green investment world. It will focus especially on the role that public policy can play in encouraging and facilitating green investment. What are the policy tools, incentives, guarantees and other mechanisms that steer green investment effectively? How do you leverage public dollars to unlock private finance for green growth? Panelists will examine the extent to which green companies rely on government subsidies or tax incentives, and discuss how sustainable investing can help provide the capital to scale clean energy technology needed for a sustainable economy.<\/p> <p>***********************************<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-and-nature\/events\/229291350\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":4500000,"name":"Building a Public-Private Partnership to Finance the Green Economy","id":"229291350","time":1458855900000,"updated":1458862060000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1366528561000,"name":"Science & Nature","group_lon":-74,"id":8152742,"urlname":"science-and-nature","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"science & nature lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York 10011","address_1":"110 5th Ave","name":"Work-Bench","lon":-73.99292,"id":24426893,"state":"NY","lat":40.737667,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":0.867684483528,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457977060000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>Join us for a panel, we're getting \u00a0insight into the latest in technology all the way from Estonia on hot topics: FinTech, Blockchain, Info Security, e-Residency, more...<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>You must use this link to officially register, meetup RSVP is not sufficient; \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Learn about the world's first\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/e-estonia.com\/e-residents\/about\/\">e-Residency program<\/a>,\u00a0which can provide a digital identity to anyone in the around the world interested in safely\u00a0and securely administering location-independent business online through convenient \u00a0digital services.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.identit.ee\/\"> Identit.ee<\/a>, originally from Estonia, is coming to New York to explore and share how this program will revolutionize how e-Residency can connect with startups,\u00a0the Blockchain, e-Government and more.<\/p> <p>The event is joined by the MD of the Estonian Government\u2019s e-Residency program, as\u00a0well as thought leaders in Fintech, Blockchain, Information Security, and e-Government to see how a legally recognized e-identity can help US companies establish themselves\u00a0in Europe as well as discuss what it means to have an e-Residency, the Blockchain, and how the two combined create a legal digital identity on the Blockchain.<\/p> <p>This New York event is part of a global program that will culminate with events running in San Francisco, Berlin, Tokyo, London, Tallinn and more cities tbc.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>The panel will include:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Kaspar Korjus<\/b>\u00a0- Managing Director of e-Residency in the Government of Estonia<\/p> <p><b>Siim Sikkut<\/b>\u00a0-\u00a0ICT Policy Adviser, Government Office of Estonia<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Sten Tamkivi<\/b>\u00a0- Co-founder &amp; CEO, Teleport Inc.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>John Edge<\/b>\u00a0- Chairman, Identity2020<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Arie Levy-Cohen<\/b> -\u00a0Blockchain Advisor<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Joseph Lubin<\/b>\u00a0- Founder, ConsenSys Systems<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Panel Moderator:\u00a0John Biggs<\/b>\u00a0- East Coast Editor at TechCrunch and Founder at Freemit<\/p> <p><br\/>You can get your ticket here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1OPsjH7<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Find more information about the event on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/identitee-event-on-e-residency-blockchain-nyc-tickets-21555987539\">Eventbrite page.<\/a><\/p> <p>Message us on Meetup to get <b>$10 discount<\/b> on tickets.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.byteacademy.co\/\">About Byte Academy<\/a>: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.byteacademy.co\/\">Byte Academy<\/a>\u00a0is an industry-focused coding bootcamp in the heart of Manhattan offering\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.byteacademy.co\/index.php\/our-program\">full and part-time programs<\/a>\u00a0emphasizing Python programming language.

Cryptoparties are always free to attend, public, commercially and politically non-aligned and absolutely against sexual harassment and discrimination.<\/p> <p>There are no dumb questions, you do not need to know anything about this subject, nor do you even need to bring a computer or phone. However that will\u00a0help you get the most of it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This event is always open to everyone and free. We spend hours promoting the event in the community each month not just online. We purposely hand our flyers to anyone &amp; everyone. We also do not ever discriminate. All are welcome regardless of gender\/gender non-conformity, age, technical knowledge, race, class, privilege,sexual orientation,etc. Harlem is a diverse beautiful melting pot and we want to represent that. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information see the global cryptoparty website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoparty.in\/\">&lt;\/a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cryptoparty.in\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cryptoparty.in\/<\/a><\/p> <p><b># WHERE ## ## ## ##<\/b><\/p> <p>Creative Workspace @ HBA\u00a0<br\/>@CreativeWrkspce\u00a0<br\/>The #Harlem co-working space located at\u00a0<br\/>275 Lenox Avenue\u00a0(also known as Malcom X Blvd)\u00a0<br\/>NY,NY\u00a0<br\/>10027<\/p> <p>\"Power to the Creatives!\"<\/p> <p>* always free $<\/p> <p>closest train 2\/3 to 125th Street Station<\/p> <p>short wallk from A\/B\/C\/D\/ 125th Street Station<\/p> <p>ok walk from 4\/5\/6 125th Street Station<\/p> <p><b># WHEN ## ## ## ##<\/b><\/p> <p>Thursday, March 24st, 2016 @ 5:45pm (-9pm)<\/p> <p><b># WHY ## ## ## ##<\/b><\/p> <p>we will be available to answer, discuss, teach, and learn about secure mobile use, secure browsing (using tor), secure email (using gpg), and secure chat (using otr). \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>**THIS EVENT IS NOT A CRYPTOPARTY AS IT WILL BE TAPED ON CAMERA FOR TV.

Oh, wait. We never said that. Let me re-phrase this a bit. Ahem. Ok, so not all groups doing agile succeed in delivering software. And not all folks trained in two days of Scrum are magically anointed with the agile wisdom of Ron Jeffries and a Midas touch.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What should we do? Go back to Waterfall? Train people for four days? Well, I think it is time we do a re-set, and educate folks on what agile is all about. If you are dogmatically following along with a handful of agile practices, stuck in\u00a0\u201cshu\u201d\u00a0but don\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d the intentions behind the agile mindset, you may (will?) be disappointed.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look to understand the\u00a0principles as we co-authors meant them to be.\u00a0Learn that agile is a state of mind, not a rote process.\u00a0Being agile requires continuous vigilance and constant partial attention<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve always said \u201cagile is hard to do well\u201d and I\u2019m sticking to it!\u00a0<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jonkern\">Jon Kern<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JonKernPA\">@JonKernPA<\/a>) is passionate about helping clients succeed in delivering business value through software. He works with (typically distributed) teams to articulate, design, architect, and deliver software that solve challenging business problems. From analysis to helping provide solutions, to mentoring teams, and all points in between, Jon routinely has significant impact on the projects he works on. Either working with the client\u2019s team, and\/or pulling together a team of experts from around the world\u2014Jon creates a quick-hit ability to solve problems and deliver results. Projects routinely see high quality solutions in less time, and leave the local team mentored on object-oriented and agile techniques, and excited. (Often more valuable than the technical improvements ;-))<\/p> <p>Jon has a knack for taking the long view, seeing the big picture\u2014yet knowing the details, and driving business success at every turn. Folks interested in truly establishing a best of breed solution, an enduring sense of quality and process, a desire to deliver business value, and having fun while doing it, love Jon.<\/p> <p>His varied career has spanned jet engine R&amp;D, flight simulators, to being an object-oriented and lightweight process evangelist through the 90s, authoring books with Peter Coad, helping to form TogetherSoft, and his work co-authoring the Agile Manifesto for Software Development in 2001. Many credit Jon with much of the stellar success that TogetherSoft enjoyed with the UML modeling\/IDE product and with the professional mentor group he formed.<\/p> <p>Jon constantly seeks better ways for teams to accomplish their goals, from a technology perspective; and from a people and methodology perspective. Jon likes to help teams build an environment that enables effective practices, solid architecture, agile development, quality-by-design (not accident), and laser-like focus on delivering business value through strategic use of the IT group.<\/p> <p>Please note:\u00a0Attendance is free, but Eventbrite registration in advance is\u00a0REQUIRED.<\/p> <p>Thank you to our sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/becteam.com\/\">Berkana Enterprise Consulting<\/a>\u00a0for providing the speaker, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/excella.com\/\">Excella Consulting<\/a>\u00a0for providing the space &amp; live stream.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/5\/f\/600_448126687.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/7\/5\/600_448126709.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe look forward to your participation\u00a0this Thursday!!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/a-perfect-solution-for-all-your-development-needs-by-jon-kern-tickets-23933666240 - To register for event!!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ScalingAgileNYC\/events\/229795921\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":6300000,"name":"A Perfect Solution for All Your Development Needs- By Jon Kern","id":"229795921","time":1458857700000,"updated":1458865159000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374093707000,"name":"Scaling Agile NYC","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":9401902,"urlname":"ScalingAgileNYC","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"attendees"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Edison","address_1":"35 Roosevelt Drive","name":"Kiddie Keep Well Camp","lon":-74.339058,"id":24076799,"state":"NJ","lat":40.548519,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.0387115479,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455567600000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/F23qjR9I9RE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/F23qjR9I9RE<\/a><\/p> <p><b>What is Inner Engineering?<\/b><\/p> <p>Inner Engineering is a method, a tool to engineer a deep and lasting personal transformation.\u00a0<br\/>It is a combination of methods and technologies derived from the ancient science of yoga.\u00a0<br\/>It is a comprehensive system addressing every aspect of human wellbeing \u2013 from body, mind and emotion to the fundamental life energy within us.<\/p> <p>Over two million people have completed the \u201cInner Engineering\u201d program worldwide and have reported\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.innerengineering.com\/live\/research\/\">remarkable results<\/a>.

Known for his invention of ICE software\u00ae, a visual configurator meant for the design, manufacturing and construction industries, and built on a video game platform, Loberg leads the charge in adapting virtual reality for business. With a video game platform at its core, ICE is built to adapt quickly to advances in technologies such as virtual reality.<\/p> <p>Intent on creating a unique and powerful experience, Barrie\u2019s first initiative was to develop a virtual reality experience that combined magnetic field generators, the Oculus Rift headset and ICE. With Barrie\u2019s ICE VR experience, participants walk around a physical space while inside the 3D interface of the software, making changes to finishes and dimensions while gathering pricing and manufacturing information real-time. This one of a kind experience uses a wireless setup to track participants\u2019 head movements and location as they walk through the 3D world. Using virtual transporter spots throughout the 3D space, participants are transported from different points in the design file to \u2018recycle\u2019 the physical space.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Barrie inspires audiences with his passion for technology applications to solve business problems. His thought-provoking discussion of virtual reality will leave you inspired and ready to explore ways you can bring technology into your own business.<\/p> <p>ICE VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCE<\/p> <p>With the ICE Virtual Reality Experience, participants explore their customized ICE layout wearing virtual reality goggles. They are transported from their immediate physical surroundings to the virtual environment in ICE. Participants are able to navigate, make product changes and see the entire project updated, including the price and downstream order information. The power of the ICE Virtual Reality Experience lies in the ability of the participant to make decisions about the design before they purchase; they can see it, change it, price it and get all the information needed to make a decision quickly and accurately.<\/p> <p>At DIRTT\u2019s global headquarters, Ice Edge has hosted over 1,000 guests through the ICE Virtual Reality experience in the 1,200 square foot lab. Using magnetic field generators, guests are able to walk through ICE using a combination of technologies to create one of the few walkable virtual reality experiences in the world. Guests are enthralled as design details change around them, and immersed in experiences like standing at the edge of a 60-foot balcony, forcing them to think twice before stepping off.<\/p> <p>BARRIE LOBERG<\/p> <p>Barrie Loberg, VP, Software Development and co-founder of DIRTT is the inventor of ICE software and has over 22 years of experience in the technology and interior construction industries. Originally, Barrie created ICE in lockstep with DIRTT to respond to their unique approach to construction \u2013 complete customization and four-week lead times. In 2007, Ice Edge Business Solutions became a subsidiary to DIRTT as other manufacturers wanted to adopt DIRTT\u2019s technology, ICE software.<\/p> <p>ICE EDGE<\/p> <p>Ice Edge\u00ae Business Solutions is a Canadian technology company, providing a suite of revolutionary software solutions including ICE Software\u00ae used for design, configuration and manufacturing.

(HML). Our \u201cBig Tent\u201d goal is to bring together, integrate and drive New York City\u2019s prime assets of Healthcare, the Maker Movement and geographic placement for hyper-local Health betterment. Here are some reasons why NYC is THE locus for our initiative:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 With 55 major medical centers, NYC is the nation\u2019s prime venue for the practice of Healthcare delivery.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Our City\u2019s Metropolitan Area enjoys the largest agglomeration of Higher Education Institutions in the country---many of these offer Life Science degrees.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Digital Fabrication (\u201cDigiFab\u201d) is the Fourth Disruptor: (1) PC; (2) Internet; (3) Social Media; (4) DigiFab (including 3D Printing).<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 NYC is the center of DigiFab development in the U.S. and the Healthcare sector is the fastest growing segment in booming DigiFab worldwide.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 DigiFab has helped coalesce and now drives the Maker Movement---with its democratization of empowerment via \u201copen\u201d source, DIY and DIT (\u201cDo It Together\u201d) communities.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 With over 25 Maker\/Hacker spaces, places and labs, NYC is America\u2019s largest center for Maker venues.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Our City is also home to the annual <i>World Maker Faire<\/i>, the second-largest gathering of Makers in the country (most recently, 95K attendees during two days in September 2015).<\/p> <p>Furthermore, HML will be the world\u2019s first Health Science laboratory---open to the general public---that will also serve as an <b><i>Experiential Destination<\/i><\/b>. As such, we will welcome---and delight!---seekers of hands-on knowledge about the present and prospective state of Health and Healthcare inspiration, systems and solutions in NYC and the U.S.<\/p> <p>As the premier U.S. Life-Science \"hub\u201d and epicenter of DigiFab &amp; 3D Printing, NYC has joined the network of the new, Ultra-Urban, Manufacturing renaissance. In our nation now, making hardware (pro-actively disruptive, digitally engined and software-modulated) IS returning \u201con-shore.\u201d Taking all our City synergies into account, NYC is the perfect venue for creating the HQ of America's DigiFab-driven Healthcare Cluster.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Thus, we are confident in our HML positioning as a new kind of \u201cpublic\u201d Lab, community Health center and Life Science <b><i>Experiential Destination.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>\"Think\" of our Health Maker Lab as a <i><b>LifeSci TechShop<\/b><\/i> + <b><i>Bio-Exploritorium<\/i> <\/b>cum permanent <i><b>Healthcare Maker Fair<\/b><\/i>. HML is designed to deliver the action, the buzz and the traffic that will compel continual engagement with our target audiences.<\/p> <p>As a unique <b><i>Experiential Destination<\/i><\/b>, HML will offer its neighborhood Sponsor\/Donors a distinctive means to differentiate themselves. (For venture-capital players, HML will also present a Healthcare-hardware \u201caccelerator\u201d housing the most exciting and promising Life-Sci startups in the City.)<\/p> <p>As Health Maker Lab\u2019s Founder &amp; Executive Director, I would be delighted to exchange with interested parties about our HML Program---and a mutual focus on social commerce and common-good for the Health betterment of local communities in NYC.<\/p> <p><b>Sincerely,<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Land Grant<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Copyright Land Grant 2016.

Yep, I'm addressing those of you---among our 200 members---who have yet to get personally involved since you \"signed up\" here with \"HCx3DP Meetup NY.\"\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is still our official name...even though we've invested the last seven or eight months in a key, innovative subset of \"HCx3DP...\" That is \"Health Maker Lab\"---HML, for short.<\/b><\/p> <p>Bear with me! In this update,\u00a0I'm going to present additional (compelling!!) reasons for you to commit more of your time and attention to HML. I think in many cases, your free-will commitment likely comes down---in the main---to the appeal of our evolving strategies. And, how---despite\u00a0this world full of so much choice---they complement your own interests .<\/p> <p>Fair enough. Since some of you joined our Meetup Community, we HAVE changed our targets and readjusted our focus. Health Maker Lab is BOTH broader and narrower than HCx3DP.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Broader in that we've expanded \"3DP\" to Digital Fabrication---or, DigiFab. You know as well as I that tech of every kind is evolving at lightning speed. 3D Printing is an important subset of DigiFab---especially when applied to Healthcare solutions. BUT, there are effective ways and means beyond 3DP to deliver those novel and necessary answers. Especially if we're thinking \"Big Tent.\"<\/p> <p>Narrower in that we've\u00a0drilling down to determine the most effective of our ultimate HML solutions. Those solutions that will best meet the needs of specific patient, client or recipient communities for improved health---in a larger compass of that phrase. From our HML Community to the larger local community by narrowing our \"envisioning\" to integrate appropriate solutions. Even if they are NOT the traditional modes of \"modern\" medicine.<\/p> <p><b><i>Big Tent---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Now---as this post's title suggests---our HML operational strategy includes putting up a Big Tent and inviting disparate interests (yours!) to enter in expectation and join in our convocation successfully. At this point, we will be hard put to keep our internal HML Action Centers to eight or 10. And, to address the needs of \"only\" five or six external neighborhood partner or player populations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Internally, diverse Action Centers will promote the cross-pollination of new and novel ideas. Leading to what we hope are effective hybrid solutions in Healthcare.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Externally, serving the varied needs of sometimes competing neighborhood interest groups and organizations (\"Hood Hubs!\") WILL add to the complexity of our interfaces, relationships and connections. Human interactions ARE usually \"messy.\" (As Miss Frizzle of \"The Magic School Bus\" admonishes those who would produce scientific creativity: \"Take chances; make mistakes; get messy.\") We will have to inform our out-facing perspectives with common-good POVs commonly shared.<\/p> <p><b><i>GeoPrint---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our HML \"action footprint\" on the maps of our overlapping communities---our GeoPrint---are likely to be rather fluid. Especially to start. The interests of our HML Community, donors and partners and Healthcare recipients will ensure some curious GeoPrint \"gerrymandering.\" At least until we can rationalize our efforts---from (eventually) adequate resources.<\/p> <p>Our startup GeoPrint will (likely!) center in Brooklyn---the \"Techreative\" Borough. Our initial home-base will (likely!) reside in the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT). That's DUMBO (the City's official \"Digital District\"), the Brooklyn Navy Yard (335 tech-driven startups and ramp-ups) and Downtown Brooklyn (14 higher ed institutions and 60K students). A rich stew of assets that will help us to launch successfully. (I've lived and worked in Brooklyn for over 35 years and I can vouch for its base of resources---in our pursuit of a new kind of Health.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>From the BTT, we'll (likely!) spread in Brownstone and Riparian (East River) BK and east into UltraUrban East New York and Brownsville. Neighborhoods of high health needs. NYC enjoys 55 major Healthcare facilities. The self-selected among these will act as our first\u00a0Hood Hubs\u00a0among equals. We are---after all---focused on Health and hospitals strive to deliver that uncommon commodity.<\/p> <p>Donors and partners---action resources---may drive the expansion of our GeoPrint in unpredictable directions. It is possible that interested players in northern New Jersey could influence our development there---before, say, The Bronx or Staten Island. Certainly, the TriState Region is a natural GeoPrint extension for HML. After that...the world?!!<\/p> <p><b><i>Viral Ecosystem---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Health Maker Lab is intent on prototyping its inspirations, ideas and innovations in an initial \"sandbox\" location. We'll play with the combinations that fascinate and foster the most promising solutions to diverse needs. The most \u00a0certain possibilities are the certainty of the unexpected.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As an antidote to negative results, we will call on our Advisory Council (eventually 15 in number) of proven players. These advisors---the bases for our Action Centers---will keep us progressing appropriately to a stable ecosystem at our first HML location.<\/p> <p>At that breakout point, we envision a kind of viral HML \"reproduction\" regimen will commence.

We even think anger will help us \u2018win\u2019 our battles, and we rely on it as if it were our trusted friend. The mind of anger, however, leaves a trail of broken relationships, lost opportunities, and painful feelings in its wake. In this class, we will learn to use Buddha\u2019s skillful techniques to remain balanced, flexible and peaceful in the midst of difficult circumstances, thereby overcoming our real enemy, the painful mind of anger itself. It is not enough to simple KNOW anger is a negative force in our lives, we need to see it for ourselves. It is only when we understand the dangers of anger that we actually develop the internal power to oppose and reduce its effects. In this series, we will learn to meditate on anger and patience, discovering how to transform a disturbed, turbulent mind into a peaceful attitude that will enable us to solve our conflicts and leave us feeling peaceful and focused.<\/p> <p>The classes will include instruction, guided meditations and discussion.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/229658027\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":9000000,"name":"Featured Model: Implied & Nude Shoot w\/Nina - March 24th","id":"229658027","time":1458860400000,"updated":1458929052000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457009582000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ALL THURSDAYS at Neolyth will focus on Tarot cards, playing cards aka Destiny Cards, divination with Runes and different oracle cards...<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a great opportunity to practice your intuitive skills, learn the ancient archetypes of the Major Arcana - 'great secrets' of Tarot as well as the Minor Arcana, which stem from the 'good old' playing cards, which were used by the Egyptian scholars to read one's destiny.<\/p> <p>This gathering is suited for all levels of knowledge about divination and channeling.

The Federal Reserve's balance sheet has grown from 12\/23\/1913 until September 2008 from \"$0\" to $750 billion. Between September 2008 and December 2008, the balance sheet swelled to over $3 trillion. Today it is $4.5 trillion. The overall growth has been 515% growth, a rate of change unheard of in the history of fiat currency. This \"quantitative easing\", courtesy of former Chairman Ben Bernanke, is akin to the US creating a nuclear explosion. The only response the for the rest of the world's central banks - given the reserve currency status of the USD - was to follow suit. This is why some people have suggested that we have been fighting a currency war since QE began. As of the week ending January 30th, the Bank of Japan has moved its official policy rate to negative -0.1%. The Japanese term structure is negative out to seven years. If you are a saver in Japan, this means there is no value in holding Yen. This is the BOJ admitting defeat, and the consequences are unknown.

When her classmate Katie Matthews is dumped by her boyfriend, who then kills himself \u2014 possibly because he's (maybe) gay \u2014 the entire school goes into mourning overdrive. It's a weird time to fall in love, but that's what happens to Skim when she starts meeting secretly with her neo-hippie English teacher, Ms. Archer. But then Ms. Archer abruptly leaves the school, and Skim has to cope with her confusion and isolation while her best friend, Lisa, tries to pull her into \"real\" life by setting up a hilarious double-date for the school's semi formal. Suicide, depression, love, homosexuality, crushes, cliques of popular, manipulative peers \u2014 the whole gamut of teen life is explored in this poignant glimpse into the heartache of being 16.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club\/events\/229056870\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"NBCBC #46: Skim by Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki","id":"229056870","time":1458862200000,"updated":1458874424000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334339313000,"name":"North Brooklyn Comic Book Club","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":3663112,"urlname":"North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Comic Geeks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11211","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"132 Havemeyer Street","name":"BANTER bar","lon":-73.957306,"id":1597155,"state":"NY","lat":40.712242,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.12666845322,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438797941000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Thursday Night Foos at Banter Bar in Williamsburg. 7:30pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Pickup games on a brand New T3000.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Beginners welcome.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>***Each week Banter will offer a different craft beer for foosers for only $4 and a shot for $5.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/7\/600_440581191.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Foosball-Social\/events\/229365089\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Banter Bar Ballers every Thursday","id":"jfmsjlyvfbgc","time":1458862200000,"updated":1458874444000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420467128000,"name":"NYC Foosball Social","group_lon":-74,"id":18302063,"urlname":"NYC-Foosball-Social","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Ballers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"396 6th Avenue","name":"Haab","lon":-73.983055,"id":24407592,"state":"NY","lat":40.669441,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":5.58956098557,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457149047000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.haabnyc.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.haabnyc.com\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TacoNight\/events\/229358893\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Haab (396 6th Avenue)","id":"229358893","time":1458862200000,"updated":1458875066000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1437261607000,"name":"Taco Night!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18750919,"urlname":"TacoNight","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Taquitos"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11231","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"123 Columbia St","name":"Freebird Books","lon":-74.00149,"id":672340,"state":"NY","lat":40.68754,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.36638498306,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448924266000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We go to the past to expand our definition of \"post-apocalyptic\" and the scorched earth effect of\u00a0the Norman Invasion of 1066, when William the Conqueror was uncompromising and brutal.

What is little known is that a fractured network of guerrilla fighters took up arms against the French occupiers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In\u00a0<i>The Wake<\/i>, a postapocalyptic novel set a thousand years in the past, Paul Kingsnorth brings this dire scenario back to us through the eyes of the unforgettable Buccmaster, a proud landowner bearing witness to the end of his world.

But as the men travel across the scorched English landscape, Buccmaster becomes increasingly unhinged by the immensity of his loss, and their path forward becomes increasingly unclear.<\/p> <p>Written in what the author describes as \"a shadow tongue\"\u2015a version of Old English updated so as to be understandable to the modern reader\u2015<i>The Wake\u00a0<\/i>renders the inner life of an Anglo-Saxon man with an accuracy and immediacy rare in historical fiction.

Across the country and in every nation, people began to develop terrifying powers, summoning storms, raising the dead, and setting everything they touch ablaze. Overnight the rules changed, .but not for everyone. Colonel Alan Bookbinder is an army bureaucrat whose worst war wound is a paper-cut. But after he develops magical powers, he is torn from everything he knows and thrown onto the front-lines. Drafted into the Supernatural Operations Corps in a new and dangerous world, Bookbinder finds himself in command of Forward Operating Base Frontier, cut off, surrounded by monsters, and on the brink of being overrun. Now, he must find the will to lead the people of FOB Frontier out of hell, even if the one hope of salvation lies in teaming up with the man whose own magical powers put the base in such grave danger in the first place, Oscar Britton, public enemy number one.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-fiction-society-northern-nj\/events\/225802824\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Modern Masters:  Fortress Frontier by Myke Cole","id":"jxvfllyvfbgc","time":1458864000000,"updated":1458875810000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1233007408000,"name":"The Science Fiction Society of Northern New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1367789,"urlname":"science-fiction-society-northern-nj","group_lat":41.0699996948,"who":"SF\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"675 Hudson St b\/t 13th St & 14 St  Meatpacking District","name":"Troy Liquor Bar (Meatpacking District)","lon":-74.005318,"id":24381417,"state":"NY","lat":40.740025,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.05960035324,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458394286000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/c\/8\/600_447109096.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0You\u2019re invited to be our guest at\u00a0our Thursday Get Together\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thursday, March 24, 2016\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0TROY\u00a0<br\/>675 HUDSON ST b\/t 13th &amp; 14th street | MEATPACKING DISTRICT| NYC<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PARTY STARTS AT 8PM |\u00a0EVERYONE FREE ALL NIGHT |\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Do mention Rory\u2019s List to the door person!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dress code is Business Casual<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We look forward in seeing you there.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 Call\/ text the organizer if you have further questions\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cheers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rory<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/f\/1\/600_447109137.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Mention Rory's List to the door person","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gatherings-In-Gotham\/events\/229711651\/","yes_rsvp_count":51,"name":"Thursday Get Together @ Troy Meatpacking District!

This hike is about 4 miles, and we should be done with it in a couple hours.\u00a0 Afterwards, we'll grab a bite to eat somewhere.\u00a0 It's the first parking lot off of 287 after you get off the exit onto Skyline Drive, so keep your eyes open for it.\u00a0 I'll give those of you who sign up my cell number just in case. Driving Directions<\/p> <p>Take Interstate Route 287 to Exit 57 (Skyline Drive\/Ringwood) and proceed north on Skyline Drive (following the signs to \"Ringwood\"). Just ahead on the left is the Ramapo Mountain State Forest parking area.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/f\/600_447926159.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Description<\/p> <p>From the southern end of the parking area, follow the blue blazes of the MacEvoy Trail, which passes stone ruins, turns right onto a woods road and climbs a steep pitch. The trail continues to climb on a wide, rocky path, paralleling a cascading brook (particularly attractive after heavy rains). About half a mile from the start, the white-blazed Todd Trail begins to the right, but you should continue ahead on the blue-blazed trail, which crosses a tributary stream.<\/p> <p>Near the crest of the rise, the yellow-blazed Hoeferlin Trail joins from the right. Continue ahead, now following both blue and yellow blazes. After a short descent, the trail reaches a paved estate road. Turn left and follow the road downhill to the dam. Here, the blue blazes turn right, but you should continue ahead across the dam of Ramapo Lake, following the yellow blazes.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/5\/600_447926149.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>On the other side of the dam, the red-blazed Lookout Trail begins on the left, and in about 500 feet, the yellow-blazed Hoeferlin Trail leaves to the left. Continue ahead along the wide gravel road, now unmarked, which runs close to the lakeshore, with views across the lake. To the north, atop a hill with several pines, you can see the ruins of Foxcroft, a mansion built in 1910 which fell into disrepair in the 1950s.<\/p> <p>The road proceeds through dense laurel thickets, crosses a causeway over an arm of the lake, and passes a swamp to the left and several interesting rock outcrops. It then moves away from the lakeshore but continues to parallel it, with views over the lake through the trees.<\/p> <p>Just past the southern end of the lake, about a mile from the dam, the road reaches a T intersection, where you should turn right. Then, in another 300 feet, bear right at a Y intersection. Here, the Cannonball Trail, marked by white-\u201cC\u201d-on-red blazes, joins from the left. You\u2019re now heading north through dense laurel thickets, paralleling the western shore of Ramapo Lake. At first, the road runs some distance from the water, but after a while, the lake can be seen through the trees. In half a mile, you\u2019ll pass a building on the hillside to the left (formerly used as a ranger station) and, a short distance beyond, a rock ledge to the right of the trail offers a pleasant view of the lake.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/3\/9\/600_447926169.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Soon, another gravel road joins from the left. Follow the road ahead, crossing a stone causeway that isolates a quiet pond on the left from the main body of the lake. Next, you\u2019ll reach another Y intersection. Here, the Cannonball Trail turns left onto an intersecting gravel road, but you should bear right and continue along a winding section of the lakeshore road, now once again unmarked. A short distance ahead, bear left as another road leads right. After passing a small, abandoned stone building to the right, you\u2019ll come to another intersection. Here, you should bear right, joining the blue-blazed MacEvoy Trail.<\/p> <p>Follow the blue-blazed gravel road that runs close to the shore along the northern end of the lake, passing a private residence on a ledge to the left. When you return to the northern end of the dam, bear left, uphill, on the road, then follow the blue blazes as they turn right, reentering the woods. Continue along the blue-blazed trail, retracing your steps back to the parking area where the hike began.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be in the parking lot at noon o'clock","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthernNewJerseyFriends\/events\/229588336\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Noon O'Clock Hiking Series: Easy First Hike - Ramapo Lake & Thatcher McGee's","id":"229588336","time":1458921600000,"updated":1458934102000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346031316000,"name":"Northern New Jersey 20s-40s Friends","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":4646572,"urlname":"NorthernNewJerseyFriends","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Northern New Jersey Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11211","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"North 10th Street","name":"Bushwick Inlet Park","lon":-73.957222,"id":12601002,"state":"NY","lat":40.720291,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":42,"headcount":0,"distance":2.68111395836,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1394239682000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Pick up soccer in Brooklyn.

The higher southern peak is 1610ft and has a lookout tower on its summit.<br\/>On a clear morning we will see the NYC skyline lights from the summit as well as views of the town of Beacon and the majority of the Highlands (including Storm King, Breakneck Ridge, and little Sugarloaf).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n+++<\/p> <p>HUDSON VALLEY HIKER LEGAL DISCLAIMER\u00a0 &amp; WAIVER OF LIABILITY<\/p> <p>You agree when you sign up for this group or any of the events that you have read and understand the below.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike (or any other event), please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness and well-being and will hold no one else liable in case of injury or mishap.

It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals.

Iremar dreams of becoming a fashion designer, creating flamboyant outfits for his co-worker, single mother Galega (Maeve Jinkings). Along with Galega\u2019s daughter Cac\u00e1 and a bullpen worker named Z\u00e9, these complex characters, drawn with tremendous compassion and not an ounce of condescension, make up an unorthodox family, on the move across the northeast Brazilian countryside.

The story begins with television reporter\/anchor Karen White (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/dee-wallace-p68458\">Dee Wallace<\/a>) taking part in a dangerous police operation intended to trap psychopath Eddie Quist (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/robert-picardo-p56658\">Robert Picardo<\/a>). When confronted by Eddie face to face, she witnesses something horrifying enough to trigger selective amnesia. Plagued by a series of violent nightmares, Karen decides to admit herself to a posh recovery resort known only as \"The Colony,\" run by her eccentric New Age therapist, Dr. Waggner (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/patrick-macnee-p44298\">Patrick MacNee<\/a>), and brings along her husband, Bill (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/christopher-stone-p112890\">Christopher Stone<\/a>), for support. The night after they arrive, Karen and Bill are unnerved by eerie howling in the woods. Back in the city, Karen's co-workers Chris (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/dennis-dugan-p88371\">Dennis Dugan<\/a>) and Terry (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/belinda-balaski-p3491\">Belinda Balaski<\/a>) have been investigating Eddie's background after discovering that his body has disappeared from the morgue. Sifting through Eddie's possessions, they find a strange collection of artwork depicting wolf-like creatures, and decide to consult with Walter Paisley (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/dick-miller-p49213\">Dick Miller<\/a>, of course), the owner of an occult bookshop, on werewolf lore. Though he claims not to believe in the stuff he's selling, Paisley nevertheless convinces Chris to purchase a handful of silver bullets...just in case. Back at the colony, Dr. Waggner has organized a hunting party after hearing Karen's account of the nocturnal howling, but the men find nothing but a rabbit, which Bill is told to bring to the cabin of the sultry Marsha (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/elisabeth-brooks-p8760\">Elisabeth Brooks<\/a>) to prepare for dinner. After resisting Marsha's less-than-subtle sexual overtures, Bill is attacked by a wolf while returning to his cabin. The following moonlit night, the sleepless Bill wanders outside to find Marsha waiting and the two make love by the campfire, their bodies undergoing a frightening transformation. Just as Karen is beginning to suspect that her husband is hiding a secret far more threatening than marital infidelity, Chris and Terry have come to realize -- too late, in Terry's case -- that Eddie Quist is not only still alive, but not quite human...and he knows he's being followed. Chris arrives at the colony too late to save Terry, but manages to find Karen just as the colony's residents -- all of whom are werewolves, including Dr. Waggner -- are assembling to decide her fate.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/dante-p16940\">Dante<\/a>\u00a0fills his film with heartfelt homages to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/the-wolf-man-v55037\">The Wolf Man<\/a>\u00a0and other classic horror movies, as well as a few clever visual puns and in-jokes from his tenure with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/roger-corman-p85920\">Roger Corman<\/a>, but never strays from the path to genuine horror, particularly when\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/rob-bottin-p82566\">Rob Bottin<\/a>'s chilling monsters are onscreen.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iCmIr6OgtYg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iCmIr6OgtYg<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet at the upstairs bar\/ticket counter","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/229591992\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"The Howling  35mm film print movie starts at midnight","id":"229591992","time":1458963000000,"updated":1458974814000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Union","address_1":"899 Magie Avenue","name":"Elmora Hills Nutriton","lon":-74.241417,"id":17735602,"state":"NJ","lat":40.672642,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.2400665283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458679688000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Group workout<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ElMoraHillsNutrition\/events\/229796060\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Fitcamp","id":"229796060","time":1458986400000,"updated":1458992769000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455640044000,"name":"FitCamp","group_lon":-74.2699966431,"id":19579326,"urlname":"ElMoraHillsNutrition","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Fitcamp Bodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.95195436478,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435204009000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/e\/4\/600_363878372.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us for our morning meditation conference call every morning (7 days a week) from 6:00am \u2013 6:30am.<br\/>Our guided meditation will assist you with reducing stress in your life but also with developing a deeper relationship with the Divine Presence within your own heart!<br\/>Dial-in Number: \u00a0&lt;a&gt;(712) 775 - 7031&lt;\/a&gt;

If you wish, you can also enjoy the <a href=\"http:\/\/nysparks.com\/parks\/13\/details.aspx\">Bear Mountain park<\/a> in any other way you want, but everyone should be back to the parking lot by 1pm.<\/p> <p>We just had a similar event last weekend, you can check out the photos here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/229450322\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/229450322\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/229450322\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/a\/e\/600_447656750.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><b>COURSE:<\/b> Terrain there is challenging (rocks, roots, mud, etc), so be prepared.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods programs to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/229757211\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"229757211","time":1458996300000,"updated":1459477038000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Suffolk","address_1":"Nassau","name":"Nassau-Suffolk Greenbelt Trail","lon":-73.721802,"id":24433768,"state":"NY","lat":40.588497,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":17.982711792,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1458244562000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please note: You are not registered for this hike until you have registered with the leaders directly as described below.<\/p> <p>The Nassau Suffolk Greenbelt Trail is 20 miles long stretching from Massapequa to Cold Spring Harbor.

N[masked] W[masked]<\/p> <p>The Hike<\/p> <p>From the parking area we cross the road and walk away from Frost Valley to find the blue-blazed Pine Hill-West Branch trail. After 2 miles there is a lean-to on a short path to the left. A short distance after the lean-to before we cross a tributary of Biscuit Brook we will start bushwhacking up Fir Mountain. We will come down on the trail after summiting Big Indian rather than attempting a bushwhack descent when we are tired at the end of the hike.<\/p> <p>Directionally bushwhack ascents are easier as the right direction is up. Once we summit Fir and sign in at the canister the more directional challenge begins. There is not much up and down between Fir and Big Indian but we need to be sure we hit the col at the Catskill Divide. Walking too far down will require us to hike even further back up so hitting that col is important. Your google maps offline download of Fir will help in identifying that col. After nailing that col we will continue west to hit Big Indian. Total distance between Fir and Big Indian is about 1.5 slow miles.<\/p> <p>Big Indian\u2019s peak is about 0.25 miles away from the trail (there is a canister) so even if we don\u2019t hit it exactly, we will hit the trail and use that as our guide to the peak (there is a pretty obvious herd path to it).<\/p> <p>From here it is about 2.5 miles going down to the lean-to we saw going up and we will be well on our way to having bagged two more Catskill peaks.<\/p> <p>Things to Do - PLEASE do this.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0108rd Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

Please take a few moments and read the notes below on our best practices for piloting, frequency and safety management. PLEASE CHECK IN WITH THE FLIGHT\/SAFETY COORDINATOR before you fly or power up anything. First timers will be paired with an established S3 Team Pilot as your \u201cEvent Buddy\u201d. You can observe firsthand S3 team pilots doing the following: flight preparation, pit adjustments, frequency compliance, field behavior and group signaling\/announcing.<br\/>Got a non-racing, photography multirotor? It's always an awesome sight to see a large frame in the air capturing hi-res photography, so if you have one, please bring it. Please check in with Frank to make sure all video transmission is disabled. You will have to fly this line-of-site or run a 200mW VTX and adhere to frequency management to not interfere with the FPV racers.<br\/>Not flying? There's lot's of technical expertise, lurkers, newbies, and interested friends just hanging out, so even if you don't race, you can still fly, take videos, or just watch and learn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPlease check in at the line of canopies at the end of the parking area and ask for Frank.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0\n<b>Suggested equipment to bring:<\/b><br\/>Your aircraft(s), props and batteries, repair equipment<br\/>Something to sit on \u2013 this is an open field.<br\/>Something to sit under like a small (or large) canopy. Team members do bring canopies to manage their equipment and make repairs. We ask that everyone respects the space they need to operate comfortable.<br\/>AMA License: If you plan on flying, you can get it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>).<br\/>Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses (for young pilots under 13 it is HIGHLY recommended)<br\/>Sunscreen and water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING<\/b>:<br\/><b>NO FLY ZONE<\/b>: For safety, the no fly zone is \"IN, ABOVE AND BEHIND\" the line formed by the pilot pit area. You may not operate your quad behind or to the right of the last canopy. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there are lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control or not.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FLY ZONE<\/b>: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone . Please pilot your aircraft from within the pit area (aka the no-fly-zone). If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intentions so other pilots can avoid you. During free flight\/ practice. you may enter the field by announcing \u201cON THE FIELD\u201d loudly to entire pit area.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>CRASH &amp; TRASH<\/b>: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless and keep the park rangers happy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>KIDS<\/b>: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>\"ZERO HARM\" RESPONSIBLE FLYING:<\/b> Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious oriented and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. IOW, if you are about to have a collision, especially with a dog, bird, human, or any living thing, think \"zero harm\" first and do everything you can to avoid the collision and immediately divert your flight path even if it means at the expense of your own rig. Living things are a lot harder to repair than metal and electronics and typically don't require litigation to fix. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>RACING<\/b>: Know your skill limits and pilot your quad accordingly. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx channel \"X\" , or the most critical, \"WHOMEVER JUST POWERED UP, PLEASE POWER DOWN IMMEDIATELY!\" and so on. It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. But beyond this, most importantly, have a blast of fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT <\/b><br\/>Since most pilots are using the 5.8ghz video transmitter bands for FPV video, so please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark\/Immersion or Boscam) and frequency channel. Every pilot uses this technology to fly their aircraft safely, so it is imperative that every pilot understands and operates using safe video transmission practices.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>THE BASICS: <\/b><br\/>1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. LOOK THROUGH YOU GOGGLES FIRST. Someone may accidentally be on the channel you were assigned. Listen intently when you do (even if you have a frequency tag), and if you hear a pilot exclaim that they've lost signal, power down immediately. Flying blind is a dangerous situation and is to be avoided at all costs.<br\/>2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles\/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping.<br\/>3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video .<br\/>4) For racing, the racing coordinator(s) will make frequency assignments and assign spotters.<br\/>5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Looking forward to seeing you there!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check \"Location\" section of meetup","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SafetyThirdRacing-FPV-Drone-Racing\/events\/227943468\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"S3 Racing-These aren't the drones you're looking for !

Nitrox is another tool for divers to use. It is not designed to replace air. Nitrox is ideal for recreational diving. You can gain a safety advantage OR longer bottom times using Nitrox. In either case, many divers report less fatigue and a sense of well-being after Nitrox dives.\u00a0<br\/>In addition to feeling better after diving, the decrease of of nitrogen accumulation also allows:<\/p> <p>Increased safety margins when using dive computers.<\/p> <p>A significant increase in bottom time no-decompression limits when using Nitrox tables.<\/p> <p>A reduction of decompression time if the no-decompression limits are exceeded.<\/p> <p>A reduction of possible decompression illness.<\/p> <p>Reduces the effects of Nitrogen Narcosis.<\/p> <p><br\/>What is Nitrox?\u00a0<br\/>Nitrox is simply any mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Air is made up of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. The name \"Nitrox\" usually refers to oxygen-nitrogen mixtures containing more than 21% oxygen. Other names for this gas are EANx, Enriched Air Nitrox and Safe Air. There are two standard Nitrox mixtures. Nitrox containing 32% oxygen and Nitrox containing 36% oxygen.<\/p> <p>Why should I use Nitrox?\u00a0<br\/>The main benefit to diving with Nitrox is the reduced amount of nitrogen in your breathing gas. Less nitrogen means less risk of getting decompression sickness (DCS), or \"the bends\". Using Nitrox can also extend your bottom time. Because no-decompression limits are based on nitrogen absorption, less nitrogen means more bottom time. Many divers also claim that they feel less fatigued after diving with Nitrox (as compared to diving with air).<\/p> <p>Why do I need a Nitrox Course?\u00a0<br\/>Nitrox, like all other breathing gases (including air), has its safe limits at depth so it is very important to know and understand these limits before you make your first Nitrox dive. You will also need a Nitrox Certification card to purchase mixed gases. To fully understand the benefits of using Nitrox it is important to receive proper training. Classroom sessions include information on the theory of diving Nitrox, blending, dive tables, gas analyzing and dive planning. Upon completion you will receive your certification allowing you to use Nitrox for all your diving adventures.<\/p> <p>In addition to feeling better after diving, the decrease of of nitrogen accumulation also allows:\u00a0<br\/>- Increased safety margins when using computers.\u00a0<br\/>- A significant increase in bottom time no-decompression limits when using Dive Computer Nitrox plan.\u00a0<br\/>- A reduction of possible decompression illness.\u00a0<br\/>- A reduction of decompression time if the no-decompression limits are exceeded.\u00a0<br\/>- Reduces the effects of Nitrogen Narcosis.<\/p> <p>Nitrox Equipment\u00a0<br\/>Most of your regular scuba equipment will work without modification for use with Nitrox. Your regulator, pressure hoses and other equipment will work just fine.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"2nd floor rear behind SPRINT","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/scuba-nj\/events\/229368220\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"EZ Nitrox Course","id":"229368220","time":1459002600000,"updated":1459014573000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1186630197000,"name":"NJ  Scuba Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":610888,"urlname":"scuba-nj","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Aquanauts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nutley","address_1":"184 Park Ave","name":"AmVets Nutley Post 30","lon":-74.146873,"id":24286966,"state":"NJ","lat":40.813416,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.32269477844,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452106172000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"Main Entrance and Parking Lot Entrance on Walnut St","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Taoist-Tai-Chi-in-Nutley\/events\/229734587\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Continuing Tai Chi Class","id":"rgsmnlyvfbjc","time":1459002600000,"updated":1459010010000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328986782000,"name":"Taoist Tai Chi in Nutley","group_lon":-74.1600036621,"id":3276262,"urlname":"Taoist-Tai-Chi-in-Nutley","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Tai-Chi-ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"67 Mulberry Street","name":"Columbus Park","lon":-73.999342,"id":893345,"state":"NY","lat":40.715848,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.4149286747,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455403067000,"fee":{"amount":8.94999980927,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i><b>PLEASE BRING BOTH A BLUE T-SHIRT &amp; A WHITE T-SHIRT. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Downtown PickUp Soccer<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Started by a group of soccer fanatics who love to play the Beautiful Game and wanted to create a meetup for individuals of all levels.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our Mission:\u00a0<i>Play safe, get your workout on &amp; HAVE FUN!!<\/i><\/p> <p><b>The Lowdown:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

This festival was brought down from Indian in 1838, by Indian Indentured Immigrants.\u00a0<br\/>Holi is celebrated forty days from the planting of Holika (Castor Oil tree). The burning of Holika takes place on the Eve of Phagwah (full moon night). A huge structure (pyre) is built and kindled at the appropriate time in a symbolic act. Phagwah commemorates the New Year for Hindus.\u00a0<br\/>Phagwah started at a time when India was facing a serious drought, affecting the various crops. However, the rain eventually came pouring down to the satisfaction of the people (farmers) who came out in the fields; playing with the water in joyous jubilation as they throw it on each other. Soon after, they start reaping their bountiful harvest (crop).\u00a0<br\/>There are special forms of music and songs which are associated with Phagwah; Chowtaal singing is the dominant style, which is heard from Basant Panchmi night until eight days after Phagwah.\u00a0<br\/>Holi was celebrated before the Prahalad\u2019s legend. However, the story of Prahalad added new dimensions. Prahalad\u2019s defiance of the many impositions of his father, King Hiranyakasyapu is testimony and evidence of firm faith in Truth and God. The burning of Holika (Prahalad\u2019s Aunt) is reminiscent of his victory over evil. King Kasyapu contrived various diabolical means to kill his son Prahalad, who went against his will, but all his efforts were in vein. King Hiranyakasyapu; has a blessing (boon) that he would not die in the day or night, nor inside or outside of his house nor would he be killed by man or beast. So he felt that he was God and proclaimed that all worship must be henceforth Given to him.\u00a0<br\/>Soon after, Lord Vishnu came in the awful form of Narsingh (half man and half lion) at twilight (neither day nor night). Lord Vishnu brought to an end the tyranny, arrogance and atrocity of the evil King (Hiranyakasyapu) in the centre of the doorway (neither inside nor outside of the house).\u00a0<br\/>Holi in all embracing has a historic meaning with a strong social content which caters for reunion, social exchanges, greetings and visits, it also provides for spiritual communion and economic assessment so that the New Year can experience the emergency of a world free from want, poverty, full of justice and goodwill.\u00a0<br\/>`When the winter is over and nature rejoices, it is time for us to bring out the abeer, abrack, powder, perfume, beat the drums, sound the jhaal, sing and dancing for it is harvest time. The spring crop is reaped and everyone is in a happy mood, bubbling with enthusiasm and in joyous jubilation as they celebrate.\u00a0<br\/>The coloured water\/powder symbolized the unique floral beauty of spring and the vanishing of hatred feelings, jealousy and enmity, and bringing into the community a feeling of togetherness. This celebration sees all cast and class as one. The red does not represent anyone\u2019s blood.\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaieteurnewsonline.com\/2012\/03\/08\/the-significance-of-phagwah-2\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaieteurnewsonline.com\/2012\/03\/08\/the-significance-of-phagwah-2\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.kaieteurnewsonline.com\/2012\/03\/08\/the-significance-of-phagwah-2\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cA HAPPY AND JOYOUS PHAGWAH TO ALL\u201d\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Outside front entrance.
