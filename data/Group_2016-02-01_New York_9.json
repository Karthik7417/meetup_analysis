Raise your spirits<br>\n\n while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher.<br>\n\n Drinking Liberally gives like-minded, left-leaning individuals a place<br>\n\n to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a<br>\n\n book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent<br>\n\n frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk<br>\n\n politics.<\/p>\n<p>Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths,<br>\n\n you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your<br>\n\n local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time.<\/p>\n<p>While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make<br>\n\n liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and<br>\n\n irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't<br>\n\n do it.<\/p>\n<p>It began in New York City in May, 2003, when it felt as though the<br>\n\n politicians, press and public were giving conservative cons a free pass.<br>\n\n We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session,<br>\n\n playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be<br>\n\n saying.<\/p>\n<p>And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made<br>\n\n buttons.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back<br>\n\n up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards.<br>\n\n But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a<br>\n\n space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and<br>\n\n enlarge a circle of progressive friends.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/highres_419391462.jpeg","photo_id":419391462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/600_419391462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/thumb_419391462.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176938362,"name":"DL","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/highres_233554912.jpeg","photo_id":233554912,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/member_233554912.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/thumb_233554912.jpeg"}},"members":481,"name":"Drinking Liberally NYC","id":17535782,"state":"NY","urlname":"Drinking-Liberally-NYC","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Proud Liberals"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412976329000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mensa","name":"Mensa","id":311},{"urlkey":"gifted","name":"Gifted Adults and Children","id":10476},{"urlkey":"smart-people","name":"Smart People","id":16148},{"urlkey":"intelligent-conversation","name":"Intelligent Conversation","id":45071},{"urlkey":"high-iq","name":"High IQ","id":71674}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup\/","rating":4.58,"description":"<p>A Meetup Group for members of Greater New York Mensa<\/p>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.GNYM.org\">www.GNYM.org<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/highres_439547040.jpeg","photo_id":439547040,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/600_439547040.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/thumb_439547040.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":36158832,"name":"Laura Catania","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/highres_236798392.jpeg","photo_id":236798392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/member_236798392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/thumb_236798392.jpeg"}},"members":88,"name":"Greater New York Mensa Meetup","id":17538592,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Mensans"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412990206000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dogrescue","name":"Dog Rescue","id":109},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"animalrescue","name":"Animal Rescue","id":10495},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"giant-large-breed-dogs","name":"Giant\/Large Breed Dogs","id":19162},{"urlkey":"dog-friendly-events","name":"Dog Friendly Events","id":22760},{"urlkey":"animals","name":"Animals","id":37663},{"urlkey":"pets-animals","name":"Pets","id":53052},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"large-breed-dogs","name":"Large Breed Dogs","id":687062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DoggyBnBnyc\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>Calling all PET LOVERS in the New York pet community. <br><br>DoggyBnB is a new Dog Sitting Social Network.

We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards.

Drinking Liberally is part of Living Liberally, an organization that seeks to build progressive communities through social networks and events. It started in 2003, during what was a fairly rough time to be politically liberal, as a group that was one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought the political left needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If any of this resonates with you, this group is the right place for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those of us who do not want to watch our unlived life go by -- the one we know in our hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other without judgment, and create a community that promotes and celebrates risk-taking for your heart's goals (which, unfortunately, our families, friends and society are not always on board with). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>We look forward to meeting you!<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net\/items\/it\/img\/arrow-10x10.png\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width :

Single Parents Sharing Resources is a cooperative that will enable single parents to built networks to create a practical support system in Rockland\/Bergen Counties and Western Westchester, to empower families socially, spiritually, and economically.<\/p>\n<p><span>Single parents can be isolated and overworked. This group will enable members to team up with other local single parents to share childcare, share resources, and share rent\/mortgages (homesharing). Meetups will enable parents to meet and connect with other like-minded single parents looking to create practical support systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Even finding one other parent to team up with to share meals with on a weekly basis can be a boon, reducing the workload and creating social connections and support (for example: dinner at your house Tuesdays, dinner at my house Wednesdays). In the past, meeting other local parent(s) whose schedule matched yours was difficult, but modern technology enables these connections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Examples of support systems we're creating include but are not limited to:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0-Childcare cooperatives: can be as simple as getting together with one other parent to take turns doing childcare. Can be as elaborate as large groups that keep track of child-care credits or home-school cooperatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>-Resource sharing--clothing swaps, costume swaps, sharing items like lawn mowers, cooking tools, canning tools, et al.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0-Home-sharing--connect with other parents looking to team up to provide daily practical support to each other and split the costs of home rentals or mortgages through home-sharing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>-Meal sharing--taking turns with other parents to cook and host meals. Great to not have to cook dinner every night, and creates social support system as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>-Work parties: need to clean out the garage, move, make dinner, bake bread, build a play structure, build a chicken coop, etc, etc, etc?

Brain Body Mastery has two main components. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindfulness\">mindfulness<\/a> and other types of meditation, or low stimulus attention control, meaning focusing in a slow and quiet way. The other component is high stimulus attention control, which is about taking simple movements and brain exercises, and integrating them into complex, whole brain activities. They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain. Practice mindfulness or meditation, and you grow your brain. Even just practice being curious once in a while, and usually your brain grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The goal of BrBd is to be as <b>in control of our conscious energy<\/b> as possible. The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions.

I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/highres_112494562.jpeg","photo_id":112494562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/member_112494562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/thumb_112494562.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414861657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"italian","name":"Italian Language","id":184},{"urlkey":"french","name":"French Language","id":185},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"italian-culture","name":"Italian Culture","id":15028},{"urlkey":"spanish-culture","name":"Spanish Culture","id":19169},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"italian-lessons","name":"Italian Lessons","id":29637},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-italian","name":"Learn to Speak Italian","id":45489},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"learning-spanish","name":"Learning Spanish","id":50595},{"urlkey":"spanish-lessons","name":"Spanish lessons","id":51717},{"urlkey":"french-lessons","name":"French Lessons","id":82861}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Learn-to-Speak-FRENCH-ITALIAN-SPANISH-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in learning FRENCH, ITALIAN, and SPANISH language and culture in NYC!

Our objective is to present public concerts of Songs from India - different regions and languages, in a chorus style, sprinkled with solos. We generally stay away from Bollywood songs. In concerts, we employ live orchestra for accompaniment. Our orchestra is a collection of Indian and Western instruments. While our music is authentically Indian, our performance is a bit fusion in style. Our presentation style is formal and professional, sort of like that of the New York Philharmonic in Lincoln Center.<\/p>\n<p> Our recent concert on October 4, 2015, consisted of 12 non-Bollywood songs from different regions of India. It was a spectacular success and received 10+ minutes spontaneous standing ovation. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are always looking for new singers to join us. If you would like to sing with us or play ANY Indian instrument reasonably well, please contact us. We are located in Hastings on Hudson, NY. <br><\/p>\n<p>We do expect long term commitment for rehearsals and performance. There is a simple audition process before acceptance into the chorus.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to visit our blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/highres_442866637.jpeg","photo_id":442866637,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/600_442866637.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/thumb_442866637.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4779472,"name":"Avinash Lall","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/highres_240761462.jpeg","photo_id":240761462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/member_240761462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/thumb_240761462.jpeg"}},"members":47,"name":"Westchester Music of India Group","id":18122872,"state":"NY","urlname":"Westchester-Music-of-India-Group","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.9700012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1415318532000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cashflow","name":"Cashflow","id":885},{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"multifamily-investing","name":"Multifamily Investing","id":58294},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-investments","name":"Commercial Real Estate Investments","id":70646},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-financing","name":"Commercial Real Estate Financing","id":71534},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-networking","name":"Commercial Real Estate Networking","id":77426},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-management","name":"Commercial Real Estate Management","id":77427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crowne-Management\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Greetings Everyone,<\/p>\n<p>Crowne Management is a full service property management, with the ability to handle services in commercial, rental and condominium buildings industries.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has the absolute goal to deliver the most efficient solutions and results.

I do not have enough experience to say that I am a teacher, but I will be the facilitator. We will play improv games and run scenes. We will do many different things related to improv. Additionally, I am thinking that this could be a great place to talk about anything else we want to do. We can talk about possibly having a separate group for people interested in stand-up comedy. We can also talk about possibly having a separate group for people interested in writing and\/or acting in sketches. Another goal, of course, is just to have fun and meet new people!

We want men to be empowered to achieve their dreams and not feel stigmatized by pop culture. Because what We stand for is a Niche Away from the Norm, We strive to create a balanced gaming community of respect, integrity, and harmony among gamers.

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3.

Our focus is to draw the male figure and depict masculinity in an open-minded, sex-positive nature&nbsp;not found in traditional drawing groups. When both the model and the artist are naked, they are on equal footing, encouraging openness and camaraderie.

If you do a sexual pose, talk it through with your partner. Poses are not an excuse to have sex with an unwilling partner. Don\u2019t assume. It\u2019s always okay to say no or stop. If you don\u2019t have CLEAR consent, don\u2019t get sexual. <\/p>\n<p>A little movement is okay, but come back to the same position and hold it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>PRIORITY RSVP AND \"NO-SHOW\" POLICY:<\/p>\n<p>To reward regular attendance and reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d, we have a priority RSVP system similar to airline priority seating.

It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with a little social time before and breaks during. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>Bring all your own materials, drawing boards, portable easels, etc. Most guys draw on pads on their laps.

If you\u2019re working in a notebook, show your drawings to the person taking photographs so he can take some snapshots. Take your drawings home with you!<\/p>\n<p>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<\/p> \n<p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW; IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION? There is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. From time to time, there will be special classes with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A NAKED EVENT BEFORE. WHAT'S IT LIKE?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. At studio venues, there are usually about 15-20 artists, at private homes about 10 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed after checking in and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, the poses can be sexual. <\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER POSED BEFORE. Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We'll help you out if you want, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. There is a sign-up sheet for poses with about 12-15 posing slots per session (varying lengths 5-20 minutes) so not everyone poses at each session. Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IS THIS A GAY GROUP?&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexual so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT'S THE SEXUAL ENERGY OF THE GROUP LIKE?&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies depending on who shows up and is often higher at private homes but the focus is always on the art.

Peer to peer feedback will be a routine aspect of each meeting along with career guidance from industry professionals. Affording opportunities to network both personally and professionally is a foundation of this organization. This is accomplished through the following types of monthly events: - Writing Workshops: We bring in industry professionals for hands-on sessions where you can learn new techniques and skills to improve your work. - Feedback Opportunities and Pitching Practice: You will have many opportunities to present in front of your peers in order to gain exposure and gather feedback. - Networking Events: Meet other writers, actors, directors, producers, and other industry professionals to explore and form new collaborations. - Film Screenings: We curate films based on the group's interest to stimulate and facilitate group discussion and learning. - Guest Speaker Series: We invite active industry professionals who will share their experiences, insights, and advice.

Our vision is to spread an atmosphere of safety that invites playful connection. &nbsp;We explore topics such as: what it means to have \u2018inherent belonging\u2019, the power of play in creating safety &amp; connection, and the energetic benefits of music.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DfeBofb3bzI&amp;list=UUi-z-bUXKT6SwIHxc6tlbrg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DfeBofb3bzI&amp;list=UUi-z-bUXKT6SwIHxc6tlbrg<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.haikudeck.com\/title-education-presentation-OxFxFVF7aW\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.haikudeck.com\/title-education-p...<\/a># <br><\/p>","lon":-73.8600006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/3\/b\/highres_434265115.jpeg","photo_id":434265115,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/3\/b\/600_434265115.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/3\/b\/thumb_434265115.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":17449981,"name":"Zack Zwiebel","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/highres_245700042.jpeg","photo_id":245700042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/member_245700042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/thumb_245700042.jpeg"}},"members":85,"name":"Naturally Social Hang Out Space","id":18278931,"state":"NY","urlname":"Naturally-Social-Hang-Out-Space","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":41.0400009155,"who":"Chill Chums"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419806476000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"lanparty","name":"LAN Party","id":3214},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"onlinegaming","name":"Online Gaming","id":10289},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"mmorpg","name":"MMORPG","id":23024},{"urlkey":"world-of-warcraft","name":"World of Warcraft","id":23041},{"urlkey":"pc-gaming","name":"PC Gaming","id":24570},{"urlkey":"console-gaming","name":"Console Gaming","id":28643},{"urlkey":"gaming-tournaments","name":"Gaming Tournaments","id":28984},{"urlkey":"multiplayer-gaming","name":"Multiplayer Gaming","id":29436},{"urlkey":"counter-strike","name":"Counter-Strike","id":159294},{"urlkey":"league-of-legends","name":"League of Legends","id":165342},{"urlkey":"esports","name":"eSports","id":377691},{"urlkey":"moba-multiplayer-online-battle-arena","name":"MOBA Multiplayer Online Battle Arena","id":886732},{"urlkey":"hearthstone","name":"Hearthstone","id":1482782}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/eSports-Heroes-of-NYC\/","rating":4.84,"description":"<p>Greetings Heroes,<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to our official home on meetup.com! <b>eSports Heroes<\/b> is a global organization of gamers who care deeply about the growing world of electronic sports.

Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity.

Our mission is to create more fun, freedom and fulfillment in the lives of EVERYONE. Admit it, you are either in dire need of fun or you love to have fun. What better way to exercise that fun bone than traveling the world with friends and family, meeting some fun and amazing people, and participating in fun filled excursions. Best part about it is that you decide what fun is for you. What does freedom mean to you? Freedom from mediocrity. Maybe you are time broke, always working and never have time with family. Maybe you have too much time and no money to do the things you love to do. Everyone could use a little extra money or a lot of extra money. One thing is for sure, we would all love more quality time with family and friends. You decide what you would like to be free from or free to do. Here's my favorite part of what we are centered around; fulfillment. What would make you feel fulfilled in life? What are your dreams and aspirations in life? What if you surrounded yourself around goal-oriented, ambitious and hard-working individuals, is it safe to say your lifestyle will change for the better? Better yet, is it safe to say you become who you surround yourself around? If after answering these questions you have even an ounce of curiosity or interest than you are who we are looking for.

To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you\u2019ll remain on the RSVP list.

I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you\u2019re genuinely interested in giving it a shot \u2013 stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and\/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive). We also limit our membership to men who are ADULTS - we will take men in their early 30's, but our IDEAL range is really mid-to-late-30's, 40's and 50's.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/highres_432994493.jpeg","photo_id":432994493,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/600_432994493.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/thumb_432994493.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3053297,"name":"Gil M.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/highres_1996121.jpeg","photo_id":1996121,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/member_1996121.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/thumb_1996121.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"NYC Gay Jewish Single Men 30's - 50's","id":18293308,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Gay-Jewish-Single-Men-30s-50s","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Jewish Gay Single Men"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420249833000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"bilingual-spanish-english","name":"Bilingual Spanish\/English","id":22885},{"urlkey":"mexican-culture","name":"Mexican Culture","id":26835},{"urlkey":"mexican-food","name":"MEXICAN FOOD","id":43018},{"urlkey":"mexico","name":"Mexico","id":63786},{"urlkey":"scuba-snorkeling","name":"Scuba & Snorkeling","id":68602},{"urlkey":"latino-culture","name":"Latino Culture","id":74736},{"urlkey":"central-and-south-america","name":"Central and South America","id":101685}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/I-love-Tulum-Mexico\/","rating":0,"description":"I am opening this group to bring together all the lovers of Tulum Mexico- its culture, people, sites, beaches, hotels, restaurants, local food, weather, and beauty.

We will each have an opportunity to sign up to teach a topic, lead a workshop, give a lecture or anything in between for up to 45 minutes.\u00a0This is a chance to try new things and have different experiences that we hope, in turn, will build community. As members of this group we\u00a0have one goal: to help grow our community of knowledge by sharing of ourselves and of course, have fun in the process! That means simply participating or signing up to lead us in a presentation.\u00a0<span>Is there anything you've always wanted to try but never did or a way you've wanted to push yourself, or something you love deeply that you wish you did more? Anything can be the theme of your presentation to the group<\/span><span>- from a juggling workshop to a lecture on evolution to a story of your travels to origami- what matters is that you bring something to the group that you love and are excited to share. On your assigned presentation week please be sure to come prepared with any materials you might need and of course let the group know if anything should be done in advance. Then \u00a0the rest of us will learn, grow, and be enriched....until it's our turn to present and enrich others!

If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes. Our group meets to read and discuss the principles that make up the Daily Lessons, the Text, and the Manual for Teachers. For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way: Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0All are welcome to join us in this gentle and relaxed setting of learners.$5 donation for room.

My husband and I love going out for dinner, seeing a movie or comedy show, and other fun activities. We\u2019d like to plan a regular once a month night out. Occasionally, we\u2019d also think about doing family activities as well where we can take the kids and all get to know each other. Please join us! Night\/weekend activities are preferred.

I began marathon running in 2010 and consider running a bit of an obsession. After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs. The goal is to accommodate athletes who work abnormal hours and provide the valuable benefits of a running community for those with even the most demanding work schedule.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14630646,"name":"Steve N","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/highres_243261789.jpeg","photo_id":243261789,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/member_243261789.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/thumb_243261789.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"NY After-Hours Runner","id":18379811,"state":"NY","urlname":"After-Hours-Runner","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"After-hours Runners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422278895000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"knitting","name":"Knitting","id":212},{"urlkey":"community","name":"Community","id":15227},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"knitting-circle","name":"Knitting Circle","id":46642},{"urlkey":"charity-knitting","name":"Charity Knitting","id":99164},{"urlkey":"knitting-crocheting-for-charity","name":"Knitting  crocheting for charity","id":1110492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-hugs-nyc-org\/","rating":0,"description":"\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffKnitting Hats Donating Umbrella's, knitting gloves, and scarves.

I imagine we would also discuss schools, parenting issues and what it's like to be a gay dad. Group is for you no matter how child came into your life or how old the child is.

The constant headlines of change and disruption is enough to leave anyone with more questions than answers.<\/p>\n<p>While its natural to internalize and apply ones thinking to his\/her own interests, experts agree that it's also important to understand a view that is larger than that which transcends our own interests. The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us. Stay tuned for our first monthly meetup happening soon! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/highres_435397559.jpeg","photo_id":435397559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/600_435397559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/thumb_435397559.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":16428041,"name":"Todd Barrish","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/9\/highres_243364313.jpeg","photo_id":243364313,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/9\/member_243364313.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/9\/thumb_243364313.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp","id":18393038,"state":"NY","urlname":"Lower-Manhattan-Tech-MeetUp","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Lower Manhattan Tech Enthusiasts"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=10&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=fc3989d27604b0569e132fb98e1bd25c&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","method":"Groups","total_count":12356,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups","count":800,"description":"None","lon":-73.9899978638,"title":"Meetup Groups v2","url":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=9&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=fc3989d27604b0569e132fb98e1bd25c&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","id":"","updated":1454357330000,"lat":40.75}}
