Borne from a collaboration between the Helix Bioscience Institute-HBI (www.helixbioscience.org) and Science Shaping Our World-SHOW (www.scienceshapingourworld.com), Biology and the \"Computer after Dark\" seeks to provide a venue for a diverse and innovative gathering of individuals interested in the amazing potential that exists within multidisciplinary groups with the desire to bring about positive change. In a business casual setting, old friends and new, can gather to network, share their ideas, pose challenges, raise a toast, tell a joke, and share in the group camaraderie. Despite our many \u201ctouch points\u201d that allow us to be virtually connected 24\/7, we often find ourselves more disconnected from each other than ever before. In the hyperfast pace of our daily lives, we are awash in an ever-increasing fog of noise and distraction that can obscure those things most important to us. Through this meetup we seek to do exactly that \u201cmeetup\", connect, share, and create a rich \"physical network\" of colleagues and friends that can serve to enrich our professional as well as personal lives.

Watch out for dinner announcements to grab a chair at the table!<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":53845772,"name":"Liz Cormack","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/7\/4\/highres_167182132.jpeg","photo_id":167182132,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/7\/4\/member_167182132.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/7\/4\/thumb_167182132.jpeg"}},"members":400,"name":"Boston Gastronauts","id":11707522,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Gastronauts","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Gastronauts"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1388730356000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ethnic-food","name":"Ethnic Food","id":15210},{"urlkey":"culinary-travel","name":"Culinary Travel","id":16272},{"urlkey":"food-tasting","name":"Food Tasting","id":17132},{"urlkey":"ethnic-dining-cooking","name":"Ethnic Dining & Cooking","id":17410},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"gourmet-cooking","name":"Gourmet Cooking","id":24614},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"cooking-demos","name":"Cooking Demos","id":44726},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Well-Fed-Boston-area-Ultimate-Foodies-Cooks\/","rating":4.91,"description":"<p>Does everything about food excite you?

Join us!<\/p>\n<p>The walks will mostly be at DW Field Park in Brockton, but will be scattered around the south shore depending on the organizer.<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you at a walk soon,<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Kim<\/p>","lon":-71,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/f\/6\/highres_436005302.jpeg","photo_id":436005302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/f\/6\/600_436005302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/f\/6\/thumb_436005302.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9228148,"name":"Kimberly ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/c\/e\/highres_250277358.jpeg","photo_id":250277358,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/c\/e\/member_250277358.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/c\/e\/thumb_250277358.jpeg"}},"members":379,"name":"The South Shore Walking\/Hiking Group","id":12679742,"state":"MA","urlname":"thesouthshorewalkinghikinggroup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":42.0800018311,"who":"walkers\/hikers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1391400627000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"filmind","name":"Film Industry","id":382},{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"art","name":"Live Music","id":1502},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"theatre-and-performance-acting-workshop","name":"Theatre and Performance Acting Workshop","id":37506},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Poiesis\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Are you a budding actor and\/or filmmaker?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Got a scene you're working on?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Need a place to air out your creative process?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In this group you will find:<\/p>\n<p>- a place to run scenes you are working on for auditions, films, and theater projects.<\/p>\n<p>- \u00a0a supportive, creative environment in which to work on developing your own methods and process as a filmmaker and\/or actor.<\/p>\n<p>- the opportunity to observe and learn from others.<\/p>\n<p>- a chance to act in or direct scenes.<\/p>\n<p>If you plan on coming, please RSVP, and bring:<\/p>\n<p>Scripted material you want to work on,\u00a03-5 pages max, or something comparable.

Our practice is 90 minutes of traditional Japanese karate with direct lineage to Gichin Funakoshi and includes kihon, kumite and kata. Practitioners of all levels are welcome. You will receive the highest caliber instruction. Come experience Boston\u2019s best kept secret!<\/p>\n<p>Practice is on Mondays and Thursdays from 7:15 \u2013 9.00 P.M. and Saturdays from 10:15 A.M. to Noon.<\/p>\n<p>Karate-do is the Way of the Empty Hand. It is derived from the ancient Okinawan fighting style and heavily influenced by the Chinese martial arts. The style of karate we practice is the traditional Shotokan as practiced from the time of Gichin Funakoshi. We are affiliated with Shotokan Karate of America (SKA).<\/p>\n<p>Master Gichin Funakoshi introduced karate-do to mainland Japan in 1916. He had been initiated into all the major Okinawan karate methods and taught a synthesis of the Okinawan styles as a total discipline. This method became known as Shotokan. Because of the great popularity of the style in Japan and, later, around the world, Funakoshi is widely considered to be the \u201cfather of modern karate-do. Aside from creating Shotokan karate and introducing it to Japan and the world, Funakoshi Sensei also wrote several books, one of which is \u201cKarate-Do Kyohan\u201d - The Master Text, which is the \u201chandbook\u201d of Shotokan. The original Japanese text of Karate-Do Kyohan was translated into English by Tsutomu Ohshima in 1973.<\/p>\n<p>We practice Shotokan karate in the traditional manner for the development of mind, body, and spirit. This art form has been passed down from teachers to students in an unbroken line from Funakoshi Sensei himself to Ohshima Sensei to us. We believe it is the responsibility of each practitioner to learn and practice the techniques correctly so that the tradition is preserved and can be passed on intact to the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>Shotokan Karate of America is a national nonprofit organization that has been teaching traditional karate-do in the United States since 1955. SKA was founded and is still led by Tsutomu Ohshima, who is one of Master Funakoshi Sensei\u2019s last direct pupils. In 1955 Mr. Ohshima came to the United States and was the first person to teach karate to the U.S. public.

I have had a passion all of my life in the areas of wellness, self-improvement and the mind-body-spirit connection. I have experience in areas of Community Health, Oncology, Case Management, General Med-Surgical, Orthopedic, and Emergency Nursing. This experience as a Nurse has given me understanding of how all people - patients, their caregivers and the health care workers are affected by stress and burnout. Yoga became my LIFELINE when I was working night shift in the ER - It helped me so much to destress and ultimately take action towards regaining balance in my life. I do have a special interest in helping all Caregivers and Nurses with stress management &amp; self-care.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>My Yoga style is <b>gentle - moderate<\/b> Hatha Yoga designed for stress relief.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My classes are laid back and relaxed...stretch, laugh, build strength and flexibilty and repeat. &nbsp; I am not interested in Yoga as a workout so much as a work IN. &nbsp; &nbsp;My teaching style is focused less on alignment and more on the experience of yoga in your own body. &nbsp; Finding what works for you...<\/p>\n<p>Life is always a balancing act - Yoga is your net! My Mission as a Yoga teacher is to cultivate personal power, personal practice, personal growth and provide <b>space<\/b> in a class to experience your Yoga ~ I teach Gentle to Moderate Hatha Yoga always exploring our edges to grow and evolve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are also free meditations &amp; discussions on my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCNpfuXzkBRzxiGGZpLEaYEQ\">you tube channel<\/a>&nbsp; - with more to come... &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you in class &amp; please contact me with any questions!

And for those of us who want to enjoy life! Have more fun! Suffer less!\n\nThe idea is to volunteer, give, get, or trade support. For example, I have a section of my basement that I want to clean up and get rid of stuff I don't need. And I never do it. I'd contact someone in the network (or someone would contact me, if they feel so moved) and we will agree to meet in my basement at a specific time, for one to three hours, and do what needs to be done. I may agree to barter with my support person the same amount of time, where I help him or her another day; or I may just receive the support as a gift, if my person isn't trading or doesn't need support in anything at this time, or prefers that someone else does it; or maybe just believes \"what goes around comes around.\" Whatever.\n\nYou may want a different kind of support, such as to change careers or some action that takes a more sustained effort than simply cleaning up a basement. You'd find someone, or several someones, for that.\n\nYou may wish to volunteer and helps others, even though you don't need support.\n\nYou may be in a tough situation or very challenging time in life, and really need support; so you just receive help, without any compulsion to give back at this time.\n\nI also wish to have more fun and more company in life! \"Many hands make light work\" is an old saying I find quite true.

Our meetups will be in the form of Laughter Yoga and Meditation sessions followed by brief discussions about laughter and play in our lives. \u00a0Laughter Yoga and Meditation involves simple movements, breathing, and obviously laughter, and is open to all ages. \u00a0Comfortable clothing is a plus but Laughter Yoga and Meditation isn't your usually yoga class so no special attire, mats, or props required although you'd be quite surprised on how much a workout continuous laughter can be. \u00a0No previous experience in yoga, meditation, or having a sense of humor necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin and I\u00a0started this group because we like to play and laugh, and laughter yoga was one of\u00a0the best ways we have found to fulfill that basic need. There are many proven physical\u00a0and psychological health benefits to the practice, which have been backed by peer-reviewed studies, but speaking to people about laughter yoga what comes up often\u00a0is that people feel they\u2019re not having enough fun in their life. We would like to\u00a0address that.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Which brings up the question: What is laughter yoga? Despite the name, there are\u00a0<br>\n\nno physical poses. What it takes from yoga is the attitude of practice \u2013 the idea isn\u2019t\u00a0<br>\n\nto be the best at doing the exercises, but simply to start where you are and begin\u00a0<br>\n\nto develop, over time, an innate and core aspect of your humanity. While yoga\u00a0<br>\n\nconcentrates mainly on the body, this practice focuses primarily on the capacity for\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter and playfulness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Laughter is by its nature contagious, so while it may begin like \"fake\" laughter, it\u00a0<br>\n\noften turns into real authentic laughter. \u00a0Playful exercises are generally the types of games you would play with a young\u00a0child.<\/p>\n<p>Time Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker (subscription needed for\u00a0<br>\n\nfull article) have all written about laughter yoga. Though he has no affiliation with\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter yoga, Dr. Stuart Brown gave an interesting TED talk on the importance\u00a0<br>\n\nof play to the human brain.

(Joomla and WordPress are also CMSs.) Drupal is used to create and manage all kinds of web content. Though Drupal is very powerful as a framework to build websites of all kinds, it is nevertheless remarkably user-friendly. Drupal empowers people from all walks of life, with little previous web design or development skills to relatively easily create dynamic websites with all sorts of bells and whistles. Of course easier doesn\u2019t mean effortless! A growing number of educational, Fortune 500, governments, and nonprofits already use it or are now migrating to Drupal. Places like the MIT Media Lab, The White House, The United Nations, Amnesty International, Best Buy, Zappos, FedEx, and The Economist use Drupal.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Best Bilingual Solutions, Inc. : Best Bilingual is a startup publishing house based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that publishes printed, digital and audio books in all the major and many of the minor languages of the world. The company has so far published four titles in up to eight different languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and French, with many more titles and languages to come in the near future, in printed, audio, and eBook formats.

Our overall goal is to make our communities safer by empowering teenagers and helping them to become successful young professionals.<\/p>\n<p>By helping us you are helping the youth. &nbsp;Thank you for your contribution!&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/boston-young-professionals\/contribute\/\">https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/boston-young-professionals\/contribute\/<\/a><span><a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/boston-young-professionals\/contribute\/\">(Secured Payment)&nbsp;<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-albanians\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Background photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/veseliphotography.com\/\">http:\/\/veseliphotography.com\/<\/a> <br> Artwork: Miguel Cruz, vmcruz421@gmail.com<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/d\/4\/highres_381879892.jpeg","photo_id":381879892,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/d\/4\/600_381879892.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/d\/4\/thumb_381879892.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":132406162,"name":"Erin K.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/e\/2\/highres_242141698.jpeg","photo_id":242141698,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/e\/2\/member_242141698.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/e\/2\/thumb_242141698.jpeg"}},"members":2197,"name":"Boston-Young-Professionals","id":14989102,"state":"MA","urlname":"boston-young-professionals","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Professionals"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402411414000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gis","name":"GIS","id":4346},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"mapping","name":"Mapping","id":10842},{"urlkey":"cartography","name":"cartography","id":18252},{"urlkey":"geospatial","name":"Geospatial","id":27142},{"urlkey":"openstreetmap","name":"OpenStreetMap","id":40968},{"urlkey":"geolocation","name":"Geolocation","id":78867},{"urlkey":"spatial-data","name":"Spatial Data","id":117260},{"urlkey":"geographic-information-systems-gis","name":"Geographic Information Systems: GIS","id":117262},{"urlkey":"maps","name":"Maps","id":131188},{"urlkey":"d3-js","name":"d3.js","id":921262},{"urlkey":"environmental-mapping-and-gis","name":"Environmental Mapping and GIS","id":1206952},{"urlkey":"maptime","name":"Maptime","id":1499052}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maptime-Boston\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Maptime is a monthly meetup where we work on maps, learn about geospatial data, and teach each other the latest cartographic tools.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking.

Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent\/collaborative work time.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!

Together, we can grieve, grow, here and feel validated in our experiences.&nbsp; It's easy to hear \"that is in the past\"---get over it!&nbsp; But you cannot \"get over\" what is still alive today due to such early trauma, and this group will help us all to validate our experience and walk through our struggles to lead happier, healthier lives.<\/p>\n<p>This group is for women who experienced early&nbsp;trauma specifically from their mother, likely that the trauma came out later, as an adult in life and affects your daily life, especially relational life with others.&nbsp; We come from a loveless family (see Jon Bloch's book on this:&nbsp; The Loveless Family).&nbsp; Other Specific issues are attachment problems, particularly insecure and preoccupied attachment due to not being securely attached within your own family(many resources on his subject-see Karen's book on \"Becoming Attached\", as well as struggles discussed in Jasmin Cori's book, \"The Emotionally Absent Mother\".&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This group is planned to be a closed group for older (45-65), single, childless women and for women&nbsp;where there will be no healing&nbsp;with their moms and preferentially also with other family members, and thus, are faced with having to deal with this on our own.&nbsp;&nbsp;The group design intends to be one where we are&nbsp;VERY SAFE to share whatever is needed to&nbsp;help each other through this healing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These affects are often severe, and for this group , there is \"Nothing to heavy to share\"....as the group is intended to embrace the grief and sorrow of this experience and support each other in healing.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-71.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/6\/c\/highres_377735692.jpeg","photo_id":377735692,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/6\/c\/600_377735692.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/6\/c\/thumb_377735692.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":5373288,"name":"N Ellen","photo":{"photo_id":187071422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/d\/e\/member_187071422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/d\/e\/thumb_187071422.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Please Notice Me:  Early Childhood Trauma Support Group","id":15175432,"state":"MA","urlname":"PleaseSeeMe-Early-Childhood-Trauma","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Franklin","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1403146427000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life","name":"Make New Friends, from all Walks of Life","id":17225},{"urlkey":"learning","name":"Learning","id":18296},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"charity","name":"Charity","id":25598},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Franklin-Newcomers-Friends\/","rating":4.97,"description":"<p>New to town or just looking for something new?

New members joined after the original members completed the training program, so we've evolved into a more free-form workout-buddy thing where new runners are welcome to start the interval training, old runners are able to do 5K time improver exercises or longer runs according to their own preferences, and everything stays social by scheduling workouts by time instead of by distance so that we all warm up and cool down together. The track is open to the public and I've seen people running, walking, and interval training regardless of what time I've been there, so it's been perfect. There's parking on the street for Somerville residents and a small commuter lot that the campus police seem to ignore. However - we're in a state of transition since we're getting into winter. Because it's been too cold out for regular runs, we've switched over to doing runs every week or two for social reasons\/to get somewhere cool, like the recent runs to Bantam Cider and Downeast Cider. We've talked about Aeronaut Brewery in Cambridge and a few restaurants and festivals. Those runs are around 2 miles and that's the perfect distance to get there in about the same amount of time whether you're running intervals or just doing a straight jog, or faster if you're already really great at it. There's a virtual event posted for a fictional date in March - it's a place to suggest runs, which will then then turn into events. If you see something you'd like to try, please suggest!\u00a0 You can always +1 if you'd like to bring a friend. In the spring, we'll go back to 3 times per week.\u00a0 Send me a message if you have any questions, post comments in events if you have ideas, and I hope to meet you soon!<br>\n\n-Katie<\/p>","lon":-71.0899963379,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10313788,"name":"Katie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/6\/highres_7544998.jpeg","photo_id":7544998,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/6\/member_7544998.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/6\/thumb_7544998.jpeg"}},"members":153,"name":"Terrible Runners' Association:  Couch to 5K","id":15731332,"state":"MA","urlname":"Terrible-Runners-Association-Couch-to-5K","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Future Athletes"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Maynard","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1405569250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"dnd","name":"Dungeons & Dragons","id":553},{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"yugioh","name":"Yu-Gi-Oh","id":1424},{"urlkey":"pokemon","name":"Pokemon","id":2602},{"urlkey":"warmachine","name":"WarMachine","id":9056},{"urlkey":"tabletop-role-playing-and-board-games","name":"Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games","id":16714},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"dungeons-dragons-3-5","name":"Dungeons & Dragons 3.5","id":20367},{"urlkey":"pathfinder-roleplaying-game","name":"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game","id":27294},{"urlkey":"trading-card-games","name":"Trading Card Games","id":28488},{"urlkey":"super-smash-bros","name":"Super Smash Bros.","id":30409},{"urlkey":"role-playing-games-rpgs","name":"Role-Playing Games","id":52140},{"urlkey":"mtg-casual-play-drafts-tournaments","name":"MTG Casual Play, Drafts, Tournaments","id":52407}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Excelsior-Comics-and-Games\/","rating":4.98,"description":"This is a group so everyone can keep up and in touch with the many events that we will be running at Excelsior comics and games.

Happy Couples is a Meet Up group for couples who respect each other and place a high value on creating stable, loving relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Relationship negativity can be contagious, and is especially uncomfortable to be around if you are consciously working to create harmony in your life. And lets face it, hanging around couples who constantly nag and criticize each other is just a huge drag!! If you are a couple that are in a loving, respectful relationship (or are at least actively trying to achieve that) come hang out with us!<\/p>\n<p>Happy Couples is primarily intended to be a social group. We will get together approximately once per month to do activities like bowling, hiking, dinner\/drinks, etc., and to have fun getting to know other happy, positive couples!<\/p>\n<p>Our secondary hope is that, as people get to know each other, group members can act as positive role models for each other and provide support for handling any relationship challenges that members face. However, sharing of this kind is strictly optional and can be done as selectively and privately as you wish.<\/p>\n<p>It should go without saying that self-righteousness, nagging, criticism, and put downs between partners (or towards other couples) is not welcome at these meet-ups, nor is the use of negative gender stereotypes. However, we do welcome couples of all ages, races, religions, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, and sexual orientations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Join us for some couples fun free of unnecessary negativity!!<\/p>","lon":-71.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/highres_408766362.jpeg","photo_id":408766362,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/600_408766362.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/1\/a\/thumb_408766362.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":144182502,"name":"Daniel","photo":{"photo_id":194013642,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/6\/a\/member_194013642.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/6\/a\/thumb_194013642.jpeg"}},"members":68,"name":"Greater Boston Happy Couples","id":16956692,"state":"MA","urlname":"Greater-Boston-Happy-Couples","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Happy Partners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Swampscott","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410541166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"single-moms","name":"Single Moms","id":16264},{"urlkey":"single-dads","name":"Single Dads","id":18711},{"urlkey":"infertility-support","name":"Infertility","id":25694},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"single-mothers-by-choice","name":"Single mothers by choice","id":92839},{"urlkey":"sperm-donors","name":"Sperm Donors","id":136601},{"urlkey":"mothers-using-ivf-and-or-donors","name":"Mothers using IVF and\/or donors","id":156432},{"urlkey":"egg-donor-moms","name":"Egg Donor Moms","id":168498},{"urlkey":"egg-donor","name":"Egg Donor","id":190041},{"urlkey":"parents-via-egg-donation","name":"Parents Via Egg Donation","id":608972},{"urlkey":"moms-via-egg-donation","name":"Moms via egg donation","id":608992},{"urlkey":"donor-egg-ivf","name":"Donor Egg IVF","id":707472}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Parents-of-Donor-Conceived-Children\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is group is for parents and expectant parents of egg and\/or sperm donor conceived children (both single and coupled parents, with donor children of any age).

Something Creative Every Day!\".<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I have been a scrapbooker and stamper for about 10 years now.\u00a0 I started my foray into scrapbooking by attending a Creative Memories workshop and I was hooked!\u00a0 My style of scrapbooking has changed over the years (can you say Sticker Sneeze?). I now use a combination of digital and tradition scrapping style. I attend scrapbooking retreats a few times a year which gives me the devoted time I need to focus on my albums.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>My introduction to stamping began with taking a class at a local paper specialty store, that has now since closed (Ink About It). I fell in love with stamping! I love making hand-made cards and the first person I gave one of my cards to was my wonderful Mother-in-law! She was so appreciative that it really made my day. From there I took many classes and read many blogs to learn all about the different products and techniques that are out there! There are so many!!!<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>So..... that takes to me today! When I first started stamping, A Muse Artstamps were the first stamps that captured my attention. A Muse had grown over the years and is now know as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amusestudio.com\/attemptedcreativity\">A Muse Studio<\/a>, a direct sales company which has an incredible product line of stamps, inks, paper, pocket page style scrapbooking albums and supplies, fabulous embellishments, ribbons, tools and so much more! For anyone not familiar with A Muse Studio, they offer an exclusive line of cling-mount red rubber stamps, custom-printed papers, ribbons, dies and embellishments for creating handmade greeting cards, scrapbook pages and more.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>To continue with my love affair with card making, scrapbooking and stamping I joined A Muse Studio three years ago as an Independent Consultant. I offer workshops monthly in my home as well as doing in-home get-togethers (think of a crafty Girls Night Out). <b>I would love to have you 'meetup' at one of my workshops.<\/b><\/p>","lon":-71.4400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/8\/d\/highres_437139565.jpeg","photo_id":437139565,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/8\/d\/600_437139565.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/8\/d\/thumb_437139565.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":158138882,"name":"Pamela Fredrickson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/f\/1\/highres_243125873.jpeg","photo_id":243125873,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/f\/1\/member_243125873.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/f\/1\/thumb_243125873.jpeg"}},"members":51,"name":"Middlesex County Rubber Stamping & Papercrafting Group","id":17209222,"state":"MA","urlname":"Middlesex-County-Rubber-Stamping-Papercrafting-Group","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":42.5900001526,"who":"Creative Peeps"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411681418000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"electronics","name":"Electronics","id":7848},{"urlkey":"manuf","name":"Manufacturing","id":10560},{"urlkey":"hardware-engineering","name":"Hardware Engineering","id":18813},{"urlkey":"lean-manufacturing","name":"Lean Manufacturing","id":19474},{"urlkey":"tours","name":"Tours","id":20754},{"urlkey":"engineering","name":"Engineering","id":21750},{"urlkey":"electrical-engineering","name":"Electrical Engineering","id":31055},{"urlkey":"mechanical-engineering","name":"Mechanical Engineering","id":31056},{"urlkey":"factory-tours","name":"Factory Tours","id":56914},{"urlkey":"design-for-manufacturing","name":"Design For Manufacturing","id":99395},{"urlkey":"manufacturing-engineers","name":"Manufacturing Engineers","id":103861},{"urlkey":"advanced-manufacturing-engineering","name":"Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering","id":163968},{"urlkey":"local-manufacturing-and-exchange","name":"Local Manufacturing and Exchange","id":524652},{"urlkey":"hardware-startups","name":"Hardware Startups","id":1016452}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-England-Factory-Tours-Meetup\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>Manufacturing is awesome!

If there is a topic that makes you uncomfortable, we will not stop debating it.

The premise is simple: to deliver a night specifically tailored for a globally sophisticated crowd. Making Sundays at Minibar the premier destination for a wide variety of globally minded individuals, including but not limited to: young professionals, local socialites and fashion enthusiasts. Given the wide variety of backgrounds and nationalities, music genres rotate on a weekly basis. The night has become one of the top attractions for some of Boston's best DJs, the kind of individuals who share the vision and passion of the night's message. Where some Sundays might appear more like Salsa nights, others would be geared towards EDM, Top 40s, open-format or even Mediterranean music. Additionally, we hold fashion shows and other special themed nights (ex. Masquerade parties). International Sundays at Minibar have been going for about two years now, making Sundays one of Boston's longest continuously running nights. Upscale dress code is mandatory and admission is RSVP based. No, there is no cover. If I could cut the longer story short I would simply say that: we've built more than a typical night here, we've built a family.

They are built to address a specific use case and be modified by your analysts as your business requirements change.   What if you could not only discover predictive patterns in your historical data but also identify and act on these events as they occur in real time, while it still matters?  For example: The ability to identify a hack attempt as it occurs so you can act before any damage is done.   With the variety and volume of data available these days from a number of sources (RDBMS, web logs, sensor data, social media, etc.) we're interested in discussing how you make sense of all this data and derive real business value from it in real time.\n ","lon":-71.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":32173732,"name":"Ed Bernier","photo":{"photo_id":32824822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/d\/6\/member_32824822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/d\/6\/thumb_32824822.jpeg"}},"members":211,"name":"Boston Real Time Streaming Analytics for Big Data Meetup","id":17434542,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Real-Time-Streaming-Analytics-for-Big-Data-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Data Analysts"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Watertown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412641318000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"catholic","name":"Catholic","id":1421},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"catholic-singles","name":"Catholic Singles","id":15669},{"urlkey":"prayer","name":"Prayer","id":16040},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"catholic-young-adults","name":"Catholic Young Adults","id":27379},{"urlkey":"catholic-social","name":"Catholic Social","id":44763},{"urlkey":"waltham-ma","name":"Waltham MA","id":46029},{"urlkey":"catholic-professionals","name":"Catholic Professionals","id":52021},{"urlkey":"catholic-social-networking","name":"Catholic Social Networking","id":52023},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"catholic-friends","name":"Catholic Friends","id":86663},{"urlkey":"watertown-ma","name":"Watertown MA","id":93050}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/St-Patricks-Watertown-Young-Professionals-Catholic-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>St. Patrick\u2019s Young Professionals Group<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We are a group ranging in age from our mid-20s to early 40s.

It's \"summer\" all year long now for us! We can do what we want, when we want! No more waiting for weekends and then having to try to find parking in crowded lots etc. We are free! I retired from teaching this year and am looking for others who would love to get together for some fun (outdoors preferably) whenever we feel like it! Especially during the week when others are working and places are not crowded. While we will set-up activities to look forward to, those who are up for \"last minute\" gatherings can share their preferred \"instant contact\" info and we can text, email or call one another to invite for spontaneous fun.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I love to hike (easy to moderate), bike (same), kayak, scuba when in warm waters and explore new places. I also love to travel and think it would be great to have some friends to travel with. (Right now I'm looking at ways to explore New Zealand and Australia and environs, but I am open to anything.) I'll even learn to play cards again when the nights are long and the weather not so inviting. Don't let my \"lack of focus\" scare you- it's just about being OPEN to whatever sounds like fun as the moments arise and acting on it- with friends. I'm so happy to be retired!

Organizer Nicole Anderson is a master's level counselor, certified relationship coach and professional matchmaker. She has years of experience in event planning and is excited to extend her events to the masses. This group will serve as a forum and meeting ground for singles looking for new experiences, adventures, and relationships. Ground rules: While the group is affiliated with a matchmaking service, anyone can join and attend the posted meetups.

If you are in a situation where you have kids and are single, or raising kids \u00a0pretty much on your own, you may be familiar with the unique challenges and difficulties sometimes encountered. The hope is that this group will form a fun, helping, sharing, collaborative group of solos, (be it never married, divorced, widowed, or disconnected from the other parent for wk, military, etc)into a community within a community of people that would like to have a social life for both them and their children. \u00a0We can plan events, meetups and play dates with or without our kids. These meetups can be a huge spectrum of ideas...from parents meeting at a local place to us planning a big moms or dads night out in the city. There are all sorts of possibilities depending on our members. My hope is simply new friends will be made for social contact that is family friendly, or just for the mums and dads that want to connect and have fun with others in common situations. \u00a0&lt;br&gt; Anyone is welcome! It is not a prerequisite to be single, nor is it necessary to even have kids, if you're interested in just the adult time!?<br>\n\nIn the future we may get to a level where we could assist each other with a huge number of things. \u00a0Ie. babysitting, car pooling..there are endless possibilities based on interests of the group! Some trips, activities, excursions, etc, are hard with little ones if you're solo-but with extra hands maybe it's more doable!? Sometimes more enjoyable for parent and kid alike. .....but, as they say, it takes a \" village\" so initial kiddo ideas are endless and based on the ages of the members kids..<\/p>\n<p>So please join us, get Yourself a sitter, bring photo or two of the kiddos ( if you've got kids) and let's see where it goes....If\u00a0you're looking to join and you don't have kids, you can get a feel for the crowd. Many people that are looking for fun stuff to do around the south shore may have kids, but they're off to college, etc, and can enjoy the adult time with other singles..... And you can enjoy kiddo activities and play dates on weeks with kids, as we plan them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I envision a supportive laid back group of solos that enjoy staying active, getting out here and there, being social and want to further their kids socially...As parents with our kids, plus an extra set of eyes n hands.

You and the kids are going to LOVE our weekly adventures! <br> <\/p>\n<p>Our group meets YEAR-ROUND every Tuesday at 10am at various hiking trails in the metrowest area. It's a great opportunity to meet up with friends and enjoy some relaxing outside time and learn some new trails mostly likely right in your back yard! These events are FREE and appropriate for children up to 6 years. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Previously, I was a part of a great hiking group closer to Boston that met every week. Even though I have moved to the 'burbs', I still get out there every week with my family and would love to meet other parents who know the value of getting our kiddos outdoors. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The hikes are suited for caregivers who carry their children and for young children who toddle\/run on their own. No stroller hikes unless specified in the details of the hike. Please dress appropriately for the weather and terrain with layers, appropriate footwear, hats, sunscreen and water. Be prepared for ice, mud, scorching heat and\/or brisk winds! This is New England after all; though I don't expect them all in one hike.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We stroll at a slower pace to allow the children to soak up the environment, caregivers can chat with a new friend and we'll try to keep the group relatively close together. Our trail will be short and simple so you are free to take another loop around. Also, if your little one's pace is REALLY slow (I was once in that group) you can linger on the first trail in and we'll meet up with you on the way out.<br> <\/p>\n<p>Remember, we're kid friendly. We're all parents and caregivers doing our best to enjoy the outdoors with young children. The trails are selected for ease of walking and are short enough for the young ones to endure.&nbsp; We'll take breaks and spend plenty of time playing in leaves or snow, rolling over logs to check for bugs and skipping stones..... all things our kids should be doing and this is great place for it.<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I'm happy to help! <br> <\/p>\n<p>See you out on the trail!<\/p>\n<p>Emily Z<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-71.4499969482,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":183508660,"name":"Emily Zaffino","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/highres_242841796.jpeg","photo_id":242841796,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/member_242841796.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/thumb_242841796.jpeg"}},"members":197,"name":"Kid Friendly MetroWest Hikes","id":18324384,"state":"MA","urlname":"Kid-Friendly-MetroWest-Hikes","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Hikers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421037280000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diabetes","name":"Diabetes","id":1482},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetic-adults","name":"Type 1 Diabetic Adults","id":32017},{"urlkey":"support-for-people-with-diabetes","name":"Support for People with Diabetes","id":33456},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetes","name":"Type 1 diabetes","id":56368},{"urlkey":"type-i-diabetes","name":"Type I Diabetes","id":71560},{"urlkey":"diabetes-management","name":"Diabetes Management","id":144757},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetes-support","name":"Type 1 Diabetes Support","id":922392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Go-Type-1-Diabetes\/","rating":0,"description":"We will become the largest social, support and active gathering of Type 1 Diabetics in Boston in 2015.

Stop struggling in the dating scene and start enjoying it, from a wise, confident, intentional, approach that helps you recognize what you are really seeking, and how to take more beneficial actions towards your goal, and to spend less dead-end time and energy on efforts that lead you away from your goal.<\/p>","lon":-71.1100006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/highres_433516896.jpeg","photo_id":433516896,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/600_433516896.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/0\/0\/thumb_433516896.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":140541992,"name":"Val\u00e9rie Boudreau","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/7\/e\/highres_242963678.jpeg","photo_id":242963678,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/7\/e\/member_242963678.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/7\/e\/thumb_242963678.jpeg"}},"members":104,"name":"Merrimack Valley 40+ Dating Workshop & Fun!","id":18339593,"state":"MA","urlname":"mv-dating","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421351709000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"networkmarket","name":"Network Marketing","id":2532},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WeWork-Boston-Events\/","rating":0,"description":"We transform regular buildings into beautiful, collaborative workspaces designed to create a thriving community amongst the thousands of entrepreneurs that we house.

We would love to schedule play dates, holiday parties, park dates, moms night out, etc. Please join us if you are looking to connect with other moms and babes as well.","lon":-71.0299987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":79399982,"name":"Danielle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/3\/a\/highres_243113562.jpeg","photo_id":243113562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/3\/a\/member_243113562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/3\/a\/thumb_243113562.jpeg"}},"members":95,"name":"South Boston's First Time Moms","id":18360578,"state":"MA","urlname":"South-Bostons-First-Time-Moms","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Woburn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421850235000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"fitness-for-moms","name":"Fitness for Moms","id":102113}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Moms-Of-Woburn\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p><span>Hi all, and welcome! &nbsp;Please join if you're a mom of a baby, toddler, and\/or preschooler and you'd like to meet for walks, play dates, and little excursions.

Have you ever toyed with the idea of starting a side business that you could possibly grow into a full time career\/life passion?<\/p>\n<p>Consider this group your built in sisterhood community + playdate generator for your children + business strategy think tank! Mompreneurs are juggling a lot and the energy of mother entrepreneurs coming together with their children in a community of sisterhood support is a POWERFUL FORCE! Meetups can include brainstorming sessions, ideas for work life balance, creative time management strategies (especially managing our KIDS!), raising capital, marketing plans, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My name is Felicia, I am founder of the Mompreneur Soul and have built this FREE community to give Mompreneurs everywhere the space to bridge motherhood and entrepreneurship, a thing that is not easy to find! You can find out more about my business here at&nbsp;<a>www.mompreneursoul.com.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>A Little About My Background<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of my career I have noticed how most of my female peers, particularly mothers, were missing from top leadership positions across the corporate environment but were showing up in huge numbers as owners of small home based businesses. I began to question my own career and life decisions when I started a family and began to realize that there is far more to living a \"successful\" life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office, and that as a mother, that all came at a hefty price. In the midst of the American epidemic of career burnout, stress-related illnesses and erosion of family life, I started to question how mothers could be better supported in their struggle to allow both their business leadership and motherhood roles to coexist and simultaneously thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The result was years of doctoral research aimed at understanding the Mompreneur phenomenon, a recent societal trend where mothers are choosing to leave behind either a full time corporate career or a full time stay at home mom career for small business ownership. It became clear to me after years of interviews with mother-entrepreneurs across the country that these women were discovering a \u201cloophole\u201d to the mainstream career issues that plagued mothers for decades. Whether they had left behind a career as a corporate executive or they had been a stay at home mom for years and wanted to re-start a career, I noticed the common thread for these Mompreneur women was that they got what their soul was craving: the ability to simultaneously be a mom and have a career on their own terms, without sacrificing one for the other. These women confessed it wasn't an easy road to take, but at the end of the day they called the shots, they had more freedom to decide when they worked on the business or spending time with their children and they chose businesses that put their life passion and purpose at the center.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;My question then was how could I help power moms everywhere stuck in the fear and dysfunction of the mainstream career matrix successfully transition into entrepreneurship, and how could I help corporations who were losing these valuable savvy women leaders foster a healthier culture and environment to better retain and empower them. The answer to this question was the birth of Mompreneur Soul, a consulting firm aimed at nurturing a women\u2019s journey through motherhood and business leadership and entrepreneurship. My background includes being a mother, corporate executive, entrepreneur, business professor, certified career coach, and Kundalini yoga and meditation teacher, and my life work and passion is to revolutionize how our culture, our workplace and business leaders everywhere re-think motherhood and leadership, and how mothers can infuse soul into their families, careers and businesses.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/highres_433857755.jpeg","photo_id":433857755,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/600_433857755.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/thumb_433857755.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11310777,"name":"Felicia Newhouse","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/highres_200641352.jpeg","photo_id":200641352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/member_200641352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/thumb_200641352.jpeg"}},"members":123,"name":"Mompreneur Soul Productive Playdates","id":18399943,"state":"MA","urlname":"MompreneurSoul","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Mompreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422746234000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nondrinker","name":"Alcohol-Free","id":7174},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"recovery-and-fellowship","name":"Recovery and Fellowship","id":15136},{"urlkey":"support-group","name":"Support Group","id":15275},{"urlkey":"healing","name":"Healing","id":16151},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"support-and-recovery","name":"Support and Recovery","id":17966},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"sober","name":"Sober","id":26144},{"urlkey":"sobriety","name":"Sobriety","id":46198},{"urlkey":"sober-activities","name":"Sober Activities","id":46200},{"urlkey":"alcohol-and-drug-free","name":"Alcohol and Drug Free","id":68373}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soba-Yoga-Yoga-For-Recovery\/","rating":5,"description":"Looking for some fun and healthy sober activities in Boston that also help you along in recovery?
