Medicine X is a catalyst for new ideas about the future of medicine and health care. The initiative explores how emerging technologies will advance the practice of medicine, improve health, and empower patients to be active participants in their own care. Such emerging technologies include those that are: largely digital (e.g., online peer-to-peer healthcare communities, wearables); \u2022 methodological (e.g., human-centered design and innovation, service design); \u2022 cultural (e.g., participatory medicine, doctors and patients functioning as designers); \u2022 and more. This group is intended to bring together (e)patients, healthcare providers, experience designers, technologists, and researchers. The group will offer opportunities to hear from key members of these communities, experience emerging technologies, collaborate on projects, and more.

The idea is that us parents stay nearby while the kids have fun together for an hour or so at different locations each week or so, and we give them a break....from us.

So, Let's build a group of smart, creative, professionals that prefer to work on their own terms outside of the traditional office space a few days a week.<\/p>","lon":-70.8499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/b\/c\/highres_445318044.jpeg","photo_id":445318044,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/b\/c\/600_445318044.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/b\/c\/thumb_445318044.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":133098092,"name":"Erik Sayce","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/8\/7\/highres_251482151.jpeg","photo_id":251482151,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/8\/7\/member_251482151.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/6\/8\/7\/thumb_251482151.jpeg"}},"members":46,"name":"Northshore's Remote Workers","id":19131679,"state":"MA","urlname":"NorthshoreRemoteWorkers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.5699996948,"who":"corkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447797892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"technical-evangelism","name":"Technical Evangelism","id":197211},{"urlkey":"developer-evangelism","name":"Developer Evangelism","id":197221},{"urlkey":"platform-evangelism","name":"Platform Evangelism","id":197251}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Developer-Evangelists-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"A group for local Developer Evangelists to share information upcoming events, best practices, horror stories, developers and whatever else.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2012384,"name":"Brian Rinaldi","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/0\/a\/highres_251523082.jpeg","photo_id":251523082,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/0\/a\/member_251523082.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/0\/a\/thumb_251523082.jpeg"}},"members":34,"name":"Boston Developer Evangelists Meetup","id":19131742,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Developer-Evangelists-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Advocates"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Andover","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447798567000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"reiki-classes","name":"Reiki Classes","id":18883},{"urlkey":"reiki-share","name":"Reiki Share","id":20779}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Andover-Reiki-I-II-Class-at-Healing-Way-Center\/","rating":0,"description":"Usui\/Holy Fire Reiki 1 &amp; 2 \u2013 Saturday, November 28th \u2013 Sunday, November 29th @ 9:30AM \u2013 4:30PM at Healing Way Center Holy Fire Reiki is both powerful and gentle and provides purification, healing, empowerment and guidance.

Looking forward to making lasting friendships for us and the little ones :) The $ dues will go to the monthly meetup organizer cost. About the organizer: I recently moved to the North Shore and after previously meeting the most amazing friends on a baby meet-up group. What started as playdates at library programs turned into Holiday Parties, themed playdates, and more then our share of Mimosas :) Having a good group of mom friends can certainly break up the monotony that often takes the lead with little ones.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" &nbsp;- Buckminster Fuller<\/i><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Town Hall is an old New England tradition<\/b>&nbsp;going back four centuries, that involved true democratic participation of all citizens in their community's social and political decisions. &nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>In &nbsp;the 21st century in Newton Massachusetts we do not have a system of democratic participation. Newton politics is run by an insular political clique who do not truly welcome citizen participation. They view any citizens who attempt to participate in the political process as a nuisance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The politicians will perform a pantomime of allowing citizen participation, but it's just a sham, and they will end up doing whatever they intended to do all along, after they finish their charade or pretending to listen to feedback from the public.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Newton's politicians do not care what is best for the community, and they certainly don't care what any of the citizens think about anything. What they care about is their own positions of power, the business dealings that are at the root of all their decisions, and the status symbols of their titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you've ever attempted to get involved in Newton politics at any level you will probably recognize the truth of the above paragraph. You may also have come to the realization of the futility of expecting to ever be able to change the way things are run in Newton politics.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>The idea of <b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;is to start from scratch, to scrap the established way of running decisions, and try to envision what a truly democratic and reasonable form of local government would be. This must be a form of interaction where everyone has the right to be heard, and truly listened to, and where decisions are based on reason, sense, logic, and commitment to what is genuinely best for the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The manners of behavior and procedure that are conducted by the current political system must be discarded, because these behaviors and procedures clearly do not work in favor of the goals of true democracy. These behaviors are designed only to maintain the power dynamics of the politicians, to keep them powerful and you powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To begin with, then, we must dispense with the insincere behaviors of handshaking, gavel-wielding, and applause.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;must create a model of how local government <i>ought<\/i>&nbsp;to be conducted. We will develop this on our own, as ordinary citizens, without the participation of the politicians.

Have you ever felt happiness in your life... ...never lasts? This Buddhist group has a great positive, multi-cultural atmosphere that helps people search for the answer to life's biggest questions. Through the teachings of Buddha and historical Pure Land Buddhist teachers we understand better the direction our life needs to take in order to find the purpose of life. We offer video lectures and have meetings to discuss how to obtain an absolute form of happiness. I hope you'll stop by and attend a meeting when you have a chance! Below, you'll find some more information about what Buddhism is all about as well as our contact info and location. In Buddhism, we learn that there are two kinds of joy. Relative Happiness All the happiness we know is called Relative Happiness. Money, status, fame, wealth, family, friends, and our loved ones are all included in this category. Politics, economics, medicine, and the arts also try to provide us with Relative happiness. We seek for this type of happiness day in, day out hoping we can attain true satisfaction from it. Absolute Happiness We are all seeking for a happiness which will truly last. This kind of happiness is called Absolute Happiness. The purpose of life is to attain it as quickly as possible while still alive.

We will meet at different locations in Boston, at libraries, cafes, public areas, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>In this group, we will not dismiss spirituality for science, nor belittle the value of scientific research and inquiry for meditating and \"knowing\". But w<\/span><span>e accept as truth only that what works for us at an individual level. Regardless of whether you are an experienced meditator or a novice, we welcome all who have the desire to investigate, beyond their path and faith. If these words resonate with you, then this&nbsp;<\/span><span>may just be the group where you feel most at home.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Announcement of location will be made a week in advance. Initial meeting sessions, for meditations and dialogues, will be guided by Chris Mayya, who spent several years in monasteries of different traditions and has a background of growing up and training both in the East and the west. You can find out more about his current work at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.transformativeinquiry.org\">www.transformativeinquiry.org<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>He is also involved with volunteer coaching sessions for teens and young people on \"Attention-Awareness,\" and Life Skills training.

Long live hardware!<\/p>\n<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.<\/p>\n<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.<\/p>\n<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the \"onesy\" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or \"dumb\" cars?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being \"merely\" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The Boston Connected &amp; Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64960062,"name":"Babak Kia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/highres_247682322.jpeg","photo_id":247682322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/member_247682322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/thumb_247682322.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Boston Connected & Intelligent Device Meetup","id":19232780,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Connected-Intelligent-Device-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Endpoints"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Newton Lower Falls","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450810369000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anti-new-world-order","name":"Anti-New World Order","id":16564},{"urlkey":"truth-and-values","name":"Truth and Values","id":17086},{"urlkey":"truth-seekers","name":"Truth Seekers","id":24268},{"urlkey":"authenticity","name":"Authenticity","id":31009},{"urlkey":"searchers-for-truth","name":"Searchers for Truth","id":33939},{"urlkey":"becoming-your-authentic-self","name":"Becoming Your Authentic Self","id":79093},{"urlkey":"learning-truth","name":"Learning Truth","id":91932},{"urlkey":"truth-tellers","name":"Truth Tellers","id":102859},{"urlkey":"telling-the-truth","name":"Telling the Truth","id":110846},{"urlkey":"spiritual-freedom-wisdom-and-truth","name":"Spiritual Freedom, Wisdom and Truth","id":113025},{"urlkey":"honest-open-dialogue-with-unresticted-thought","name":"Honest Open Dialogue with Unresticted Thought","id":146054}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/2016-Fed-Up-With-Living-In-A-Completely-Dishonest-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>What this Meetup Group is about:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>This meetup group is about intelligent people meeting other intelligent people so they won't have to feel isolated in a society which is overwhelmingly unintelligent and delusional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why you should join:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>To learn, share, and have fun.

It is the opportunity for believers and non believers to get together and share their philosophical views on existentialism, share their struggles in the defiance towards status quo or peer influence, and find happiness through open mindedness, volunteer work and other sorts of humanism. I developed a philosophical posture in life called Igocentrism. Science has shown us how the three main sources of happiness are the so called Intrinsic Sources: self growth, relationships and the giving to others. However, society is negatively impacted by the pursuit of the so called Extrinsic Sources: money, status, and physical appearance. I believe this unrelenting idolatry towards the feeding of one self leads to ego-centrism, so I figured an appropriate antonym should name this new-founded ideology. Igocentrism also focuses on the liberation from religious belief, as in the societal definition of \"religion\". It is a deist approach to the existence of God - not necessarily atheist and yet open to the possibility of a non intellectual creator - which commends a utilitarian morality over an epistemological religious morality based on scripture. This group is intended for people who would like to learn more about igocentrism and hopefully find bliss in what could very possibly be the only finite life we have in this world.<\/p>","lon":-71.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/highres_445470094.jpeg","photo_id":445470094,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/600_445470094.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/thumb_445470094.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197384954,"name":"Ricardo Martins","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/highres_252416562.jpeg","photo_id":252416562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/member_252416562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/thumb_252416562.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"I.G.O Society of Free Thinkers","id":19250158,"state":"MA","urlname":"I-G-O-Society-of-Igocentric-Free-Thinkers","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.2400016785,"who":"Igomaniacs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451425174000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"charity-work","name":"Charity Work","id":16453},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"charity","name":"Charity","id":25598},{"urlkey":"cancer-support-group","name":"Cancer Support Group","id":33425},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Young-Professionals-Group-The-Lemon-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"The Lemon Society of Boston is a young professionals group which allows members to network with other like-minded professionals, build leadership skills and contribute to a worthy cause all while having a great time!

Increasingly studies are attesting to the powerful effects sound vibration has on our physical and emotional well-being. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mantra, which means \u201cthat which saves the mind\u201d or \u201cinstruments of the mind\u201d, is a collection of mathematically precise and melodic Sanskrit sound vibrations designed for specific energetic intentions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the Maha Mantra called the \u201cgreat\u201d Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This specific Mantra deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for two reasons: 1) it is one of very few mantras that combines both the feminine and masculine divinities simultaneously. 2) It can be chanted at any time and place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the origin of the Maha Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Mantra is found in the Kali-santara Upanishad, one of the 108 principle Upanishads, and was given by Brahma to the sage Narada.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the benefits of Japa Meditation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because the Maha Mantra combines both the feminine and masculine it is a Bhakti mantra or \u201cmantra of loving relationships\u201d. This works on transforming and improving the practitioner\u2019s relationships on three levels - 1) Personal (relationship with oneself); 2) Interpersonal (relationships with others); and 3) Spiritual (relationship with the divine). <\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Japa Circles?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles provide a powerful space in which the simultaneous recitation by all members amplifies the energy of the mantra exponentially. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What takes place at a Japa Circle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 15 minutes the practitioner fills out a four question survey and performs breathing and mindfulness exercises. For 30 minutes the actual Japa meditation takes place. Practitioners recite the mantra softly in rhythm and cadence with the instructor with increasingly relaxation and joy. The final 15 minutes is used for the concluding breathing exercises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of the Survey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles and the various level s can only measure quantity of a practitioner\u2019s Japa meditation.

If you want to dig in and get motivated, this group is for you. We'll be talking about everything that increase sales from getting honest reviews on sites like Amazon and Goodreads to tracking advertising efforts and their results. There is nothing shameful about being proud of your book and working hard to share it with the world. There is nothing shameful about trying to make a return on your year's of labor and time spent honing your skills.

There is no critique. There is no editing. There is 100% acceptance of the \"in the moment efforts\" of each participant. Each particiant leaves with a set of inspirations which they can process and refine outside of the workshop.
