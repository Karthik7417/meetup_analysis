Its a group for discussing anything about topics that you might be interested to learn and have questions about regardless of your level of knowledge or expertise. We encourage people with a desire to learn and anyone with a desire to share their knowledge in a kind a gentle way to others that stimulates thought and empowers those that want to learn but are insecure and feel embarrassed to ask questions in other settings such as school or work who might feel like they are being judged for their lack of understanding. We encourage open discussions and one on one break out sessions for those that might have answers and those that are seeking answer to connect. This group is meant as an alternative to the anxiety and excitement that one might feel after work or school that sometimes drives them to a place to drink or do drugs and instead replaces that excitement with something more productive safe and equally as exciting to explore and learn about all the things you alway wanted to know about but felt to shy, or dumb or whatever else type of label you might have mistakenly given yourself just for missing some knowledge. We encourage anyone to join the group that might want to just talk learn or teach. The group will start with a round table of questions of what members want to discuss and then break out sessions of those who can provide answers or feedback or just going into discovery modes for ourselves and with our peers that share a desire for the same information. Topics can include anything from order of operations in a basic algebra class to algorithm analysis about space time complexity in a computer system. Nothing small or large is off table. The only rule is to be kind and to give help where you feel you can with out a feeling of self righteousness for those who know or shyness and pride from those who don't.

But due to moving around and there, we are looking to expand our social reach and our immediate circle of friends and just fun people to hang out with.<\/p> \n<p>I see many many focused group for desis and Indian alike. But then they all end up being a group where especially when you are a new parents or a person who is trying to explore American and other cultures around run into some walls! Simple because everyone in the group is too much focused on being desi and doing desi stuffs. Don't get me wrong but I love to do that from time to time but as someone living in a country other then India, we need to adapt to that culture as well. That is why the name \"Fusion Desi\"!!<\/p> \n<p>Now, who we are looking for?<br>1. If you recently moved into the tri state area and love to explore it on your convenience time, then join in! Don't worry, we know that you have family to take care so we won't plan the event in a blind!<\/p> \n<p>2. Since we are a new parents, we welcome same however, we also understand that sometime living kids with nanny is the best thing to do!! So we got your back.<\/p> \n<p>3. We enjoy dressing up but staying classy. So like minded folks always welcomed!!<\/p> \n<p>4. Lastly, as the group gets bigger and more interesting we will defiantly try to expand the taste of the group with various types events voted by the members!! For a starter, since this is a new group we are hoping that we will have enough people very soon to take and advantage of the beautiful weather we are having. We are hoping that we will be able to plan welcome dinner for the group member at a group members home or at a upscale dinner place!! So, what you are waiting for then?

What would you really be able to do if you felt more confident, courageous and comfortable in your own skin? How would you feel about yourself if you no longer beat yourself up about the decisions you made, or didn\u2019t make? I have good news: There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. It\u2019s just fear. Fear that is subtle, insidious and tricky. And we want to help you master it. It doesn\u2019t matter how successful you already are, or how many challenges you\u2019ve faced, everyone deals with fear. It\u2019s in our biology. But just because we were born with it, doesn\u2019t mean it has to run our lives. Fearless Living has created a pathway for you to become awake to a new way of seeing the world, a world that supports you, loves you and guides you. Oprah says, \u201cEveryone needs Fearless Living.\" Imagine having the courage and the confidence to make new decisions for your life. Imagine having a clear set of guidelines and principles so you no longer repeat the patterns of the past. Imagine having support to show you how to use these new guidelines and tools in the life you have right now. Because Fearless Living isn\u2019t about jumping out of a plane, it\u2019s about jumping into life..fully, completely, authentically. And not in any woo-woo way (not that we don\u2019t love some woo-woo), but rather, in practical, grounded, down to earth ways that work. Fearless Living has been tested and refined by thousands of people who have used it to change their lives. Fearless Living was developed by Rhonda Britten, an Emmy Award-winner, repeat Oprah guest, Tedx Speaker, Huffington Post Blogger, 4x bestselling author and the first life coach on television in the world. She\u2019s changed lives in over 600 episodes of reality television and is most well-known for her work on the hit daytime NBC show, \u201cStarting Over.\u201d Named \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite Life Coach,\u201d she has devoted her life to helping people master their emotional fears: fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of success, fear of loss, etc. This Meetup Group is based on Rhonda\u2019s bestselling book, \u201cFearless Living.\u201d Rhonda says, \u201cNo one can be fearless alone\u201d and that\u2019s why I invite you to join me for this shake-up-your-life meet up group. My commitment to you is I will show you what\u2019s worked for me and for thousands of people who want to leave fear in the dust. If you\u2019re ready to master anything holding you back so you can go anywhere, do anything, meet anyone, sign up today.

POP Pilates\u00ae is an incredible fusion of ab-chiseling and total body defining moves choreographed to your favorite hits.

The fundamentals of breathing, core engagement and powerhouse-based movements are shared, however, the emphasis on moving to the beat of pop music is what makes POP Pilates\u00ae so unique.
