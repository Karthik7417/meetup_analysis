It has since expanded globally, provided free data access to scientists and conservationists worldwide, amassed a user community of 200,000 users and will cross 300 million observations. In 2015 eBird launched its own mobile data entry apps for iPhone and Android and integrated with the Macaulay Library to create a 21st Century digital museum of photos and sounds, all of which can be easily added right through your eBird checklists. eBird also has united a global community of birders by being fully multi-lingual and having specific versions worldwide, despite having completely integrated data working behind the scenes in whatever language. May 2015 saw the first ever Global Big Day, a cooperative effort by birders worldwide to take a snapshot of birdlife worldwide, engaging over 40,000 birders who recorded 6000+ species in the process. With 2016 poised to be eBird's best year ever, this presentation will discuss what eBird offers today and how it hopes to continue to unite birders worldwide in the common cause of creating the best and most complete biodiversity database in existence and get it into the hands of those who need it most.

no limits!\"<\/b><\/p> <p>Thanks to the efficiency and BI (business intelligence) of Fair Foods of Dorchester (FairFoods.org), founded about 35 years ago by self-reported vegetarian Nancy Jamison, we have way more than AMPLE food for any intended audiences, and the operation is bettered if MORE people take the food than if FEWER take the food.<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is NO QUALIFICATION (no test of need) and no limit to how much you can cart off (just pay $2\/bag and $1\/loaf of bread).\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's why I post it on a\u00a0meetup\u00a0like this (not merely on a volunteer meetup).<\/p> <p>There are tens of thousands of college students who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>There are tens of thousands (myriads) of homemakers and working individuals who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>Lots and lots of seniors AND needy folks, and there's no operational shame in prudent fiscal management if you know that you can get quality produce at a far lower price.<\/p> <p>[The snag is that, unlike in grocery stores - or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items - about 5-8 different vegetables and 2-3 fruits, and you're often 'gifted' with extra items - 30 ounce jug of fresh hummus or lentil salad or chickpea salads, pound of garlic, large one-lb plastic container of ground pepper, or lots of other 'big items' we don't typically buy.]<\/p> <p><b>Make us busy -

Her groundbreaking research at UPenn identified paths to unleash hidden gifts and lead each of us to thrive in life.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e9CR--mcoP0&amp;list=PLA625204FA97A721E&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video\">Watch a video interview with Christine<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/repository.upenn.edu\/mapp_capstone\/5\/\">read one of Christine's studies<\/a> or listen to an audio interview andlearn more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/\">www.christineduvivier.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a Free webinar- Register Here for the links and dial-in information: http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/register-have-more-impact-in-less-time-webinar\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/228202462\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":3600000,"name":"Christine Duvivier: Have More Impact in Less Time","id":"228202462","time":1455147000000,"updated":1455154096000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1362582942000,"name":"Personal Growth Network","group_lon":-71.1999969482,"id":7491122,"urlname":"Personal-Growth-Network","group_lat":42.2200012207,"who":"Lives Well-Lived"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Beverly","address_1":"314 Cabot St","name":"Papa Gino's","lon":-70.878685,"id":23890921,"lat":42.552982,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":16.5534744263,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440628533000,"fee":{"amount":0.5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Map below:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/b\/6\/600_438484022.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>PLEASE SIGN-UP SO OTHER PEOPLE WILL KNOW OTHERS WILL BE ATTENDING.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Official<\/i><\/b> time reset to 6:30 pm, \u00a0of course, there is nothing to change people coming earlier at around 6:00\u00a0as usual.<\/p> <p><br\/>We have had\u00a06 to\u00a08 people lately for each Cribbage night, but having more people is always better.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the cards.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/salemsocialcards\/events\/227783088\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Cribbage Meetup Wednesday @ Papa Gino's Beverly","id":"pdwgklyvdbnb","time":1455147000000,"updated":1455159563000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326050741000,"name":"Salem Social Cards","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3068172,"urlname":"salemsocialcards","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":6.19995117188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432176954000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please come out and join us for a pleasant evening of competitive party bridge in\u00a0 Newton Centre.\u00a0 Wednesday night bridge here has been a multi-year Metrowest tradition; it is a nice quiet spot with a fireplace, good food, ample table space.\u00a0 The more the merrier, so long as you know how to play bridge and love it.<\/p> <p>This is officially canceled unless 5 players sign up by 5pm.

Christine believes that within each of us lie tremendous untapped reservoirs of potential. Discovering the strategies and power of positive change and, conversely, releasing what holds us back, has been the defining journey of her life and work.<\/p> <p>Today, drawing on Christine's 20 + years of mentoring business executives, parents, and leaders from around the world, along with her research in positive psychology, she guides people to unleash the best within\u2014no matter where they stand currently. Learn about what Christine calls, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/2011\/02\/bright-student-bottom-myths-of-education\/\">The Gifts that Conflict with School<\/a> (and are well-suited to leadership and success).<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/b\/f\/600_446126815.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>She has mentored, facilitated, spoken and led positive change with thousands of individuals and groups worldwide, including Fortune 50 executives, individuals, families, and communities. Author of \"What I'd Say if You Wouldn't Roll Your Eyes... love notes to my child,\" Christine mentors and facilitates other professionals-- including leaders, physicians, coaches, teachers and counselors-- using positive approaches to bring out the full potential in themselves and others.<\/p> <p>Clients say, \"Christine helped me become the leader I am... get promoted.... turn problem staff to top performers... engage my team.... get people on board with new strategy and culture.... transform my relationships... see the best in me....feel energized.\"<\/p> <p>She has personally experienced the power of positive change in her life and work, beginning her study and application at age 17. As a mid-level employee in a 135,000- person company, she discovered how to have much greater impact, in much less time, as she followed her own vision, which was contrary to everything around her. As a result, Christine led a team that convinced the executive committee to adopt a radical new goal, went on to engage employees worldwide in a change that boosted customer loyalty 20%, and was promoted to Worldwide Director of Customer Quality and Loyalty.<\/p> <p>While studying and working with Martin Seligman, David Cooperrider, George Vaillant and other founders in the science of positive psychology &amp; well-being, she experienced the power of positive change when tragedy struck and she was catapulted into her own post-traumatic growth and resilience. Her groundbreaking research at UPenn identified paths to unleash hidden gifts and lead each of us to thrive in life.<\/p> <p>Watch a video interview with Christine, read one of Christine's studies or listen to an audio interview and learn more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\">www.christineduvivier.com<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/register-have-more-impact-in-less-time-webinar\/\">Register Here<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Register Here: http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/register-have-more-impact-in-less-time-webinar\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Science-of-Happiness-Boston\/events\/228283643\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":3600000,"name":"Christine Duvivier: Have More Impact in Less Time","id":"228283643","time":1455147000000,"updated":1455152825000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429219600000,"name":"The Science of Happiness: Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18550910,"urlname":"The-Science-of-Happiness-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Flourishers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"19 Stuart Street","name":"Hostelling International - Boston","lon":-71.063026,"id":7915842,"state":"MA","lat":42.35096,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.720417141914,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454105509000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this workshop you'll learn the basics of planning your train trip across the USA.

Reiki healing is a natural therapy that gently balances life energies and brings health and well being to the recipient.<br\/>\u2022 This simple, non-invasive healing system works with the Higher Self of the receiver to promote health and well-being of the entire physical, emotional and psychic body. Therefore it is truly a system of attaining and promoting wholeness of mind\/body\/spirit.<br\/>\u2022 Reiki is a specific type of subtle energy work in which healing is performed by the touch of the hands, allowing the flow of the energy from a limitless source to the recipient via the reiki practitioner. Reiki is an extremely powerful yet gentle energy that can be easily channeled to yourself and others, even by simple intention.<br\/>\u2022 Reiki healing is a pure energy form.

The Gurdjieff teaching offers a map of human being that gives the emotional center as much importance as the intellectual and moving\/instinctive centers. That map serves best as a guide for self-observation: we learn what we are, even from moment to moment. The life of the feelings, ranging from triggered reactions to deeply felt knowledge, is there to be discovered. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>The emotional center doesn\u2019t yield its secrets easily. Emotions are quicker and more subtle than movement and thinking. Their language needs to be understood. How is it possible in practice to move toward this understanding? And what is the role of attention in this process of questioning and discovery?<\/p> <p>Many emotions are what they are: ordinary, not so interesting or revealing. But sometimes a feeling appears that is immediately recognized as a different quality of knowing accompanied by a new experience of self\u2014of one\u2019s identity. These moments of finer quality can serve as a guide in the direction of self-study, deeper questioning, and relatedness. Gurdjieff once described the emotions as potentially a means of knowing. What a promising idea, that emotional awareness can develop into a unique way of knowing, appreciating, and direction-finding. On the other hand, he promised work.

You\u2019ll learn about Object Oriented Programming, a technique that allows you to use code written by other programmers in your own programs. You\u2019ll put your new Java programming skills to the test by solving real-world problems faced by software engineers.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>Why Take This Course?\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Java is one of the most popular programming languages used by software developers today. It is the core language used in developing Android apps, and is also commonly used in back-end web development. If you\u2019re new to programming and want to enter either of these fields, this course is a great place to get started.<\/p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t have a career trajectory in mind, Java programming is a great option for first-time coders due to its popularity and ease of use. This course will provide you with a solid foundation in computer science and Object Oriented Programming concepts, as well as set you on the path for success as a software engineer.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>Prerequisites and Requirements<br\/><\/b>No prior programming experience and knowledge is assumed or needed.

This talk will give an overview of US (and some Five Eyes) surveillance programs, the legal and constitutional questions they arouse, their effects on ordinary political activities, and strategies to circumvent and undermine them.<\/p> <p><b>About Alex.<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Restore_the_Fourth\">Restore The Forth's<\/a> National Chair, Alex Marthews is deep in the thick of battles on Capitol Hill to rein in the PATRIOT Act, and on Beacon Hill to increase police accountability. Alex previously ran nonprofits addressing poverty, housing, and girls' education in\u00a0East Africa, and interned with\u00a0EFF\u00a0back when it was much smaller. He moved to Boston from San Jose in 2005, and gives regular talks on surveillance policy and activism.

These are bedrock principles and fundamental rights in a free society. But what makes a search \"unreasonable\" when it comes to digital metadata, GPS location tracking, and iPhones? And how do courts conceptualize encryption, which seems to be somewhere between incriminating testimony and a traditional lock? Clearly our founding fathers did not foresee the privacy concerns we have with twenty-first century technology. \u00a0This talk will discuss how courts have determined (and struggled with) how to apply modern and quickly evolving technology to a legal framework established centuries earlier. From the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions on thermal imaging, GPS, and cell phone searches, to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decisions on CSLI and decryption, this talk explains the current state of the law and lays a foundation for where it is headed.<\/p> <p><b>About Max.<\/b>\u00a0An associate attorney with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/vjwlaw.com\/our-background\/\"><b>White &amp; Associates, P.C.<\/b><\/a>, Max Bauer addresses a wide range of substantive and procedural issues in the realm of criminal defense and privacy rights law. \u00a0He recently presented for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcle.org\/about\"><b>Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education<\/b><\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0the intersection between constitutional rights and modern technology at the program \"When Cell Phones Become Evidence.\" Although he has a limited technical security background, he has hosted a cryptoparty on Tor, SSL, and PGP.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>3.\u00a0<\/b><b>Separating the Bots from the Humans<\/b>\u00a0(7:35-7:55)\u00a0<\/p> <p>by Ryan Mitchell |\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/remitchell\">LinkedIn<\/a>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kludgist\">Twitter<\/a><\/p> <p>Web scrapers are often thought of as purely data collection tools; however, they can be used to probe large collections of websites for vulnerabilities and exploit found weaknesses, and they are often unfazed by traditional \u201csolutions\u201d like robots.txt files, AJAX loading, and even CAPTCHAs.\u00a0This presentation will provide an overview of what separates the bots from the humans and give examples of how scrapers\/bots can be used alongside more traditional tools to both attack and defend websites.<\/p> <p><b>About Ryan.<\/b>\u00a0Ryan Mitchell is a software engineer at\u00a0<b>LinkeDrive<\/b>\u00a0in Boston, where she develops their API and data analysis tools.

Mindful eating is about eating with awareness. Awareness helps people to have a better sense of when they are hungry and when they are full, when they overeat, what cues them to overeat, and what types of situations or environmental factors make overeating more likely to happen. Mindfully eating is typically thought of as slowing down, tasting one\u2019s food, pacing oneself and being able to appreciate food more. However, this is simply is not enough instruction for people who want more of a conscious approach to changing unhelpful eating habits.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Recently I found the book Eating the Moment by Pavel Somov, Ph.D. This book offers 141 exercises to eat mindfully. They are clever, helpful, and experiential options to increase one\u2019s awareness of eating. The mindful eating groups that I will be co-hosting will be based on these 141 exercises. My goal is to get through the entire book, but to find people who are interested in doing it with me. If you are interested in this journey, you must get the book. Every time we meet for dinner there will be 2-3 exercises to try during the week, and we will report on how they went for each of us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For this MeetUp I am asking people to read through the introductory material (if you haven't already) and read and complete pages 20-25. There are some \"essays\" to write regarding noticing the differences between hunger and craving cues. \u00a0Bear in mind that this involves some monitoring and tracking , so it is best to get started now if you want to be prepared to share your observations on Thursday. Remember that this is a group where participation is part of the process and there is no experiential learning if there is no experimenting\/ doing\/ trying.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Mindful Eating Meetups will be cohosted with other meetup groups, and will include locations on the North Shore as well as in and around Boston. We will try to meet consistently as there is more interest. That is also why the attendance may seem small or limited; because we are accommodating another group- the Cambridge Boston Ethnic dining group. As an FYI, this event will be mixed gender and may include men.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In addition, here is an exercise that I would like participants to consider, in the overarching theme of awareness of ethnic diversity and food:<\/p> <p>1)\u00a0 Research the country of the ethnic food MeetUp group and make a list of current facts about the country. Consider facts that you find interesting or fascinating and share your facts with the group.<\/p> <p>2)\u00a0 Find a food or spice that the restaurant uses in its dishes and research any health benefits, uses for the food, or other interesting facts about the food. Introduce the food to the group. Share the unique aspects of this food\/ spice and\/ or recipe with the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As always, I will document people who NO SHOW as a NO SHOW and move towards not letting you attend future events. So if you make a commitment, come.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"look for the yellow banana on the table \/RSVP under my name","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/228542107\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Mindful Eating- Peruvian Fusion","id":"228542107","time":1455231600000,"updated":1455896209000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"655 Boylston St","name":"Charlesmark Hotel and Lounge","lon":-71.078438,"id":21106282,"lat":42.349785,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.828665971756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453348530000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Whether you are single or a couple, please come and celebrate Valentine's Day with us at Charlesmark Hotel &amp; Lounge in Boston!

Among the most important decisions is whether to approach BDA with traditional, proprietary products or with open source frameworks and technologies. In this presentation, Pivotal's Jeff Kelly will discuss why an open source approach, though not without its challenges, is the better way to lay the technology foundation for extracting the most value from your data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Jeff Kelly is a Big Data strategist at Pivotal Software. In this role, Jeff spends his time researching, writing and speaking about trends impacting Big Data analytics in the enterprise and best practices for success. Prior to joining Pivotal, Jeff was the lead Big Data analyst at research firm Wikibon, where he published the industry's first Big Data market forecast in 2012. Before that, Jeff was a technology journalist with TechTarget covering the data management and business intelligence markets.<\/p> <p><br\/>Talk #2: \u00a0I've just wrapped up developing a system for Tripadvisor that uses Kafka and Samza to replace our existing ETL systems.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Our hope is that this series can act as a catalyst to start and\/or deepen intercultural and interfaith communication, trust building and partnership.<\/p> <p>The gathering is free of charge.

When we are honest with ourself we resonate with rejuvenation. We stare at our shadow and see it dissolve. We come to recognize the light of our being.<\/p> <p>Honesty ... The word originally comes from honor. This healing is about being willing to honor your self and to do that you have to be honest with what is serving you and what is not. It could be a way of thinking or a relationship in your life. Whatever it is, I will be opening up a space to acknowledge and transmute what is not you and align with your higher self.<\/p> <p>Being honest is as hard or as easy as we make it. If we want to play games with ourselves and keep telling ourselves the same old story because we like to be the victim or feel comfortable, then transformation is going to take a while. But if we honestly engage our shadow, it dissolves through the love of our heart. We taste the fruit of liberation.<\/p> <p>Also, we might try to actually channel Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Until next time, stay tuned :)<\/p> <p>Brian<\/p> <p>(781)[masked]<\/p> <p>General Info:<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect? When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be new years resolutions - specifically bringing in the vibrations we need! Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls. What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the Tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Please bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!

Very interesting and intriguing insights into what we have been doing all along. Understanding where it comes from and how it was discovered teaches us why we may be drawn to it and where we might take it.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a Friday evening, please be on-time and allow for enough time for traffic and finding parking. Parking near the main MIT entrance is sparse on the streets, but there is a small parking lot that often has empty spaces at night: 139 Mass Ave Visitor Lot, look for the Bank of America ATM. Parking garages are on Vassar street to west of Mass Ave.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/4\/4\/600_446443844.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Nocturne: Aqueduct of Izcuchaca,\u201d Arequipa, Peru, Carlos and Miguel Vargas, ca. 1920<\/p> <p><br\/>From Lance's lectures:<\/p> <p>The night has always been associated with romance, mystery, fear, and the unknown. The nocturne has also been a natural subject for art. Albrecht Durer printed gruesome night scenes in the early sixteenth century. Rembrandt exploited night and darkness in his paintings to increase their emotional impact. During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Goya, DeGericault, and Delacroix painted both horrific and romantic night scenes. Following in this tradition, photographers ventured into the night with their cameras within a few years of the discovery of photography.<\/p> <p>The history of night photography is almost as long as the history of the medium itself. Only ten years after the introduction of the daguerreotype in 1839, John Adams Whipple daguerrotyped the moon through a telescope. In 1863, Whipple used electric lights to take night photographs of Boston Common [<i>consider that the origin of the Greater Boston Night Photogs!!<\/i> :-)]. However, it was not until the 1880's and the invention of the gelatin dry plate negative that night photography became a real possibility.

It\u2019s an inward journey where you meet your self exactly where you are, and illuminate your 7 major chakras (energy centers). Each chakra is key holder to different parts of your self and your life, and may be holding old patterns that no longer serve you. In Chakradance\u2122, you will balance, unblock, and free up your energy flow as you simply listen to the rhythm of your soul. When energy is flowing through you, you feel better and more clear emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually. You will also be guided through meditation and creating a mandala. Come enter into this beautiful waking dream, and possibly even meet your inner warrior!<\/p> <p>DJ Mystical Michael has been a DJ for more than thirty years, beginning with turntables, then moving to CDs and now digital on his MacBook.

More postings coming...<\/p> <p><b>About the Seminar<\/b><\/p> <p>No wine evokes a passion for the land and its wines more than Barolo. One hundred and eighty-one crus spread over eleven communes, all planted with just one magical grape variety: Nebbiolo. In many ways the one grape planted in subtly varied sites of the region resembles Burgundy. But unlike Burgundy, prior to the mid-18th century, the reds here were vinified into a sweet wine of low alcohol content. Count Camillo Benso of Cavour recognized that the wines could be improved and invited French enologist Louis Oudart, to consult. Oudart produced the first dry Nebbiolo wines and set the stage for greatness.

The thick-skinned grape is a natural cross of two esoteric varieties that are from Montpellier (in Languedoc-Roussilon) and Gaillac in the Sud-Ouest. Today the majority of France\u2019s Malbec is found in Cahors, a small town on a switchback river that gently flows towards Bordeaux.<\/p> <p><br\/>Malbec\u2019s Blind Tasting Tell: Look for a magenta-tinged rim. Malbec wine is a deep purple-red that is nearly opaque, similar to Syrah and Mourvedre. However, Malbec wines will often have a bright magenta rim. A tell!<\/p> <p><br\/>Malbec Loves High Elevation.\u00a0 In lower elevations, Malbec grapes struggle to produce the acidity they need to create great tasting and long lasting wine. High elevation areas with a wide diurnal temperature shift (ie hot days, cold nights) make the grapes produce more acidity.<\/p> <p>Not As Much Oak as You Might Think.\u00a0 Because of Malbec\u2019s bold flavors and richness, many wine tasters believe that industrious use of oak is employed. Not true! In the $9-12 range you\u2019ll find most Argentine Malbec to have only about 6 months of oak aging. 10-12 months of oaking Malbec will give it that classic \u2018blueberry\u2019 smell. Some Malbec wines are aged for a long time (18-20 months), but you have to pay to play. Expect to spend around $24+ for Reserva Argentine Malbec and more for US Malbec.<\/p> <p><br\/>(source:\u00a0 Wine Folly <a href=\"http:\/\/winefolly.com\/review\/what-is-malbec-wine\/)\"><a href=\"http:\/\/winefolly.com\/review\/what-is-malbec-wine\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/winefolly.com\/review\/what-is-malbec-wine\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0 )<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Please bring: a bottle of Malbec (or mostly Malbec) in the $15-$25 range, in a paper wine bag, 4 glasses, and some go-with food to share.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>In case of bad weather, please keep an eye on this board and your email so that you know whether or not it has to be cancelled.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Blind-Tastings\/events\/227751684\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Get Warm and Cozy with Malbec","id":"227751684","time":1455408000000,"updated":1455474799000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348239833000,"name":"Boston Blind Wine Tastings","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":5036692,"urlname":"Boston-Blind-Tastings","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Tasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"595 North Ave.  Right off I95 exit 39","name":"Lakeside Tavern at lakeside Inn","lon":-71.072342,"id":24336298,"state":"MA","lat":42.503941,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.96626377106,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454704146000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is Sandie I am the Bar Manager over at The Lakeside Tavern...

But there is no Resurrection without the Cross.

Time, space, extraneous noise and interruption are altered as we move toward center. This creates a personal, sacred space, a high frequency bubble of awareness that allows your stress to be transformed by the laws of resonance.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 This interactive model gives you multiple options. You\u00a0\u00a0may use your mouse to move the cursor or you may choose to allow the program to do that for you. Either way, you may follow the mouse with your eyes or a finger. Close or cover one eye... and follow with the other: \u00a0you access &amp; enhance the opposite side of your brain. Do the same with the other, then perhaps, both. If you are using your finger to follow the cursor along the path use one finger the first time... use the same finger on the other hand next time. Again, this accesses different parts of your brain and brings clearing &amp; energy to that part that is being stimulated. This translates into clearer neurological pathways, clearer energy meridians in your body and opportunities for greater insight, stronger connections to your own intuition and spirit.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Before your 'walk, you could smudge, light a candle, say a prayer, call in the Four Directions, invite\u00a0your angels or\u00a0guides to be present with you on the path.... Set your intention if you wish, ask your guidance to show you what you need to know, or what is standing in your way. You might ask\u00a0 to understand and \u00a0release an\u00a0illusion that is keeping you from a relationship or abundance in your life.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 As you return from center, you may invite\u00a0understanding, knowing, peace to fill your awareness.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 Take time for yourself after your 'walk'. Have some water handy. This kind of vibrational\/energy work allows the body to transmute and release\u00a0long held concepts, belief forms, illusions from their resting place in cellular memory to be transformed into energy that supports you instead of weighing you down. Just as if you did yoga or had a massage, your body may\u00a0release and clear pure water will support the process.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 Even in an interactive online labyrinth... you are never alone... If we all walk at 3 on the 2nd Sunday... we walk together. And always, even when it seems we are walking alone, or not...\u00a0 our guides &amp; angels are there.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 Will be posting a couple of holiday events... hope to see you in 3D soon.

This internationally admired estate has been capably run by the Perrin family over the decades. We are more than a little proud to welcome Emmanuel Lemoine, who has worked with the Famille Perrin wines for some time. He will provide a bit of history and a lot of what distinguishes these terrific red wines.<\/p> <p>In this seminar you will taste outstanding Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Papes from three decades: 1998, 2001 and 2012. Both the 2001 and 2012 wines received 96 points from Robert Parker's The Wine Advocate, who said of the 2012 'What I think might end up being the best Beaucastel since the 1990 or 2001, the 2012 Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape offers a full-bodied, decadent style to go with awesome black and blue fruits, garrigue, licorice, crushed flowers and violets. The purity here is truly something?'\u00a0<\/p> <p>Attendees will also be among the first to taste the 2013 Chateauneuf prior to release, along with the current releases of the Perrin's Gigondas, Vacqueyras, and Vinsorbes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Not to be missed!<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0Harborview 3<\/p> <p>Speakers:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wine-expos.com\/page.cfm\/Action=Visitor\/VisitorID=3044\">Emmanuel Lemoine<\/a><\/p> <p><b>About Boston Wine Expo<\/b><\/p> <p>Boston Wine Expo happens every year and currently comprises an entire week of festivities celebrating wine, food and culture from the greatest wine-growing regions of the world.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A weeklong series of events<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Outstanding cuisine from more than 40 restaurants<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Expanded education series<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Nightly vintner dinners at top restaurants<\/p> <p>\u2022 VIP and\u00a0Grand Cru Wine Lounge, barrel samplings and vertical tastings<\/p> <p>Get more details here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wine-expos.com\/page.cfm\/Link=1\/t=m\/goSection=1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wine-expos.com\/page.cfm\/Link=1\/t=m\/goSection=1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.wine-expos.com\/page.cfm\/Link=1\/t=m\/goSection=1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There is a huge--as in thousands of people--Grand tasting Sat. and Sunday, and a VIP tasting as well, which is fairly expensive.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent.

Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening.

Best bet is to take the T to Back Bay or Hynes Convention Center (which is the closest T stop).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be downstairs.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sojust-tm\/events\/228166650\/","yes_rsvp_count":58,"duration":9000000,"name":"Dating While Progressive (@SoJust Singles Party)","id":"228166650","time":1455490800000,"updated":1455636990000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1154919590000,"name":"Socializing for Justice","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":299655,"urlname":"sojust-tm","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"SoJusters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02115","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"903 Boylston Street","name":"Lir","lon":-71.084137,"id":16348522,"state":"MA","lat":42.34827,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.08761620522,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453149424000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tired of online dating?

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

This, as it turns out, is fantastic news: When all of your strategies are blown, there is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of what it really means to love-which makes you more awesome at giving love, receiving it, and surviving its absence.<\/p> <p>Join us for an evening conversation about the realities of love.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The program will include meditation (instruction will be given), a talk from Susan, and one-to-one discussion with a random partner.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Instead of kittens with balloons and heart-shaped candies, let's celebrate the truth of love as a path of fierce warriorship.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/228709964\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvdbtb","time":1455580800000,"updated":1455594722000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"239 Holland St","name":"PJ Ryan's","lon":-71.126854,"id":23532402,"lat":42.402561,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.13978433609,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455110542000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>On Monday 2\/15 PJ Ryan's is hosting a huge release party for Ommegang's Barrel-Aged Three Philosophers.

no limits!\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Thanks to the efficiency and BI (business intelligence) of Fair Foods of Dorchester (FairFoods.org), founded about 35 years ago by self-reported vegetarian Nancy Jamison, we have way more than AMPLE food for any intended audiences, and the operation is bettered if MORE people take the food than if FEWER take the food.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is\u00a0NO QUALIFICATION\u00a0(no test of need) and\u00a0no limit to how much you can cart off\u00a0(just pay $2\/bag).\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's why it's posted on a\u00a0meetup\u00a0like this (not merely on a volunteer meetup).\u00a0<\/p> <p>* There are tens of thousands of college students who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.\u00a0<br\/>*\u00a0There are tens of thousands (myriads) of homemakers and working individuals\u00a0who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.\u00a0<br\/>*\u00a0Lots and lots of seniors AND needy folks, and there's no operational shame in prudent fiscal management if you know that you can get quality produce at a far lower price.\u00a0<\/p> <p>[The snag is that, unlike in grocery stores - or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items - about 5-8 different vegetables and 2-3 fruits, and you're often 'gifted' with extra items - 30 ounce jug of fresh hummus or lentil salad or chickpea salads, pound of garlic, large one-lb plastic container of ground pepper, or lots of other 'big items' we don't typically buy.]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Make us busy -

Since Brewing the American Dream began in 2008, Samuel Adams and Accion have provided nearly $8.5 million in microloans to 825 entrepreneurs nationwide, coached more than 6,000 small business owners, and helped create or retain more than 3,300 jobs.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/228138652\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":10800000,"name":"Play\/Learn Kitty Whist","id":"228138652","time":1455663600000,"updated":1455769304000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01730","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bedford","address_1":"202 Burlington Rd","name":"The MITRE Corporation","lon":-71.238541,"id":8056542,"state":"MA","lat":42.502563,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.0995979309,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455025960000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Pizza, refreshments and networking at 6pm<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Agenda:<\/b><\/p> <p>6:00-7:00 Networking<\/p> <p>6:00-6:45 Roundtables<\/p> <p>7:00-7:10 Announcements<\/p> <p>7:10-8:20 Presentation<\/p> <p>8:20-8:30 Questions and Answers<\/p> <p>Visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/boston-spin.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boston-spin.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston-spin.org\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0for additional details.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Presentation:\u00a0Simplifying Performance Testing with Production Data<\/b><\/p> <p>Will Hurley, Sr. Director of Astadia, will discuss system performance models, the primary challenges of which are where and how to start. Whatever the performance characteristics being estimated or modeled, we need a solid approach that addresses both business and system needs. All too often performance tests inadvertently mix load and stress scenarios with little regard for how this will confound recommendations and business decisions. If you are a test manager, a business process owner, or you simply want to better understand performance testing, you will be interested in Will Hurley's case study. Mr. Hurley presents a real-world example that demonstrates the impact on business decisions, and shows how to use production data and statistical modeling to improve both the analysis and business decisions. The case study is based on a back-end re-hosting project where acceptance criteria were based on an achieving \"equal or faster\" performance. Take away new insights and approaches to improve performance-based decisions for your organization.<\/p> <p><b>About the speaker: \u00a0 Will Hurley\u00a0- Sr. Director, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.astadia.com\/\">Astadia, (Nashua, NH)<\/a>.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>During his twenty-four year career Will has ridden the crest of numerous software development waves.

MV* patterns leave you with state spread across your entire application and with a smorgasbord of options for component communication (callbacks, eventing, shared services, etc\u2026). Redux provides a compelling solution for both of these challenges by evolving on the ideas of Facebook's Flux architecture and adding others from the Elm language.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Redux gives you a single source of truth for your UI's state and a simple subscription mechanism for components. The entire UI can is generated from this state tree and components subscribe to changes in a the slice of state that they care about regardless of what caused that slice to change. It even goes a further step further to simplify the data flow mental model by serializing\/synchronizing all state updates. This makes UI changes easy to log and apply forward and backward in time (ie time travel debugging).<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/d\/4\/3\/member_15747971.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/academictech.ou.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/lightning_talks_660x3301.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Lightning Talks<\/p> <p>Speaker - You?

In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world\u2019s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.<\/p> <p>Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico\u2019s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.<\/p> <p>With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. <i>Born to Run<\/i> is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front of the cafe near the windows.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group\/events\/228275431\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the ... by Christopher McDougall","id":"228275431","time":1455665400000,"updated":1455861730000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246242470000,"name":"Cambridge Book Club","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1481208,"urlname":"Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":9,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454538935000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dating is an intimate, private, and public act - yet there are parts about it that we are still hesitant to discuss openly. \u00a0When it comes to talking about the role of race in dating, the conversation becomes that much more difficult. \u00a0Let's get together to discuss the intricacies, complexities, and challenges that come about through race and dating.<\/p> <p><i>*This discussion will revolve around the role of race in dating, not exclusively interracial dating.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen. He began his training with Horace Daukei, the last surviving traditional doctor (medicine man) among the Kiowa Tribe. Ben went on to study with Chinese Master Li Tai Liang.
