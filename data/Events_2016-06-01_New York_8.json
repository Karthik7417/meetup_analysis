My people, it's supposed to rain this week so let's meet next week on Saturday, May 21st in Central Park. Come hangout picnic style. Bring an item if you can; Snacks, Food, Water, Mat, drinks and MUSIC (highly recommended). If we have a DJ in the house LOL, please email me if not we can use our cell phones.<\/p> <p>Just anything you can lay your hands on :) It should be casual and fun. The games include playing dodge ball, bike riding, running or \u00a0take long walks around the park and return to our station just for the fun of it. Come with cards or even chess if you like. Also add dance competition to the list of activities :)<\/p> <p>I am going to keep updating the event, we want it to be very fun and interactive. Again, please free to share ideas.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Africans-in-NYC-Meetup\/events\/230419562\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":10800000,"name":"Outdoor Activities!","id":"230419562","time":1463860800000,"updated":1463872882000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1457653457000,"name":"Africans in NYC Meetup","group_lon":-73.8600006104,"id":19691537,"urlname":"Africans-in-NYC-Meetup","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"86th Street Transverse Road","name":"Great Lawn Softball Field 7","lon":-73.96562,"id":8528672,"state":"NY","lat":40.783405,"repinned":true},"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":0,"distance":2.64238095284,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1460413449000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>General rules of the game:<\/i><\/p> <p>No called balls\/strikes. \u00a0You get three swings to put the ball into play.<\/p> <p>No taking leads.<\/p> <p>Sliding is allowed but be careful. \u00a0Be mindful of who is covering the base if you choose to slide.<\/p> <p>Game is capped at 24 to ensure those that sign up will get a lot of playing time and at-bats.<\/p> <p>Unless someone wants to play C the entire game, the position will be rotated amongst all team members equally.<\/p> <p>Unless someone wants to pitch the entire game, the position will be rotated amongst all team members equally.<\/p> <p>If 24 people sign up, the defense will be rotated so that each team member plays 4 innings in the field for each 1 they sit.<\/p> <p><i>Fee structure:<\/i><\/p> <p>First game free.<\/p> <p>$5 per person per game<\/p> <p>$25 for the season.<\/p> <p>Please arrive promptly by 4pm.<\/p> <p>I'll email\/post in the event of inclement weather potentially impacting the game. \u00a0Alternatively you can call the hotline at[masked] x111\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Central-Park-Saturday-Afternoon-Co-Ed-Softball\/events\/230414577\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":7200000,"name":"Let's Play Softball!","id":"cwxkslyvhbcc","time":1463860800000,"updated":1463873362000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1460411533000,"name":"Central Park Saturday Afternoon Co-Ed Softball","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":19829228,"urlname":"Central-Park-Saturday-Afternoon-Co-Ed-Softball","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Softball Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14227032661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460850761000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Saturday afternoon from 4:1500 to 5:15 PM<\/p> <p>This group is not for beginners!

Something that was written pre-literary award era, whose only award is the mere fact it has entered the canon of literature. Mary Ann Evans, known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, journalist, translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. Most of her novels are set in provincial England and known for their realism and psychological insight.<\/p> <p>Evans used a male pen name, she said, to ensure her works would be taken seriously. Female authors were published under their own names during Eliot's life, but she wanted to escape the stereotype of women only writing lighthearted romances. She also wished to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Middlemarch,<\/i> was first published in eight installments during 1871\u20132. The novel is set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch during 1829\u201332,and it comprises several distinct (though intersecting) stories and a large cast of characters. Significant themes include the status of women, the nature of marriage, idealism, self-interest, religion, hypocrisy, political reform, and education. Although the first reviews were mixed, it is now widely regarded as her best work and one of the greatest novels written in English.<\/p> <p>The poet Emily Dickinson expressed high praise for the novel, and it was admired by Friedrich Nietzsche for its exposure of the fear of social realities that lie beneath any conception of society. Virginia Woolf called it \"One of the few English novels written for grown-up people.\"<\/p> <p>This is not a light read--it weighs in at 800 pages!

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>(photo of atrium and location of meetup table)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/4\/0\/600_433449280.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(photo of atrium entrance at the corner of 53rd and Lex.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Don't forget:<\/p> <p>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!<\/p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!<\/p> <p>* You will be asked to sign a waiver for 2016 as we're not a litigious group. If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged\/events\/230690595\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":9900000,"name":"Women's Only Half-Court Indoor Hoops","id":"230690595","time":1463864400000,"updated":1463876212000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284011099000,"name":"[New York Co-Ed]  Basketball for the Vertically Challenged","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1703973,"urlname":"Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"bball shorties"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"240 East 31st Street (between 2nd and 3rd Ave.)","name":"Resurrection Church (Meeting at Church of the Good Shepherd)","lon":-73.961342,"id":24482248,"state":"NY","lat":40.768749,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.98591780663,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463535429000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Lift Your Hearts, Lift Your Spirits!

<p>\"Anthropologist Helen Fisher studies gender differences and the evolution of human emotions. She's best known as an expert on romantic love, and her beautifully penned books \u2014 including Anatomy of Love and Why We Love \u2014 lay bare the mysteries of our most treasured emotion.Why you should listen<\/p> <p>Helen Fisher's courageous investigations of romantic love -- its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its vital importance to human society -- are informing and transforming the way we understand ourselves.\u00a0Fisher describes love as a universal human drive (stronger than the sex drive; stronger than thirst or hunger; stronger perhaps than the will to live), and her many areas of inquiry shed light on timeless human mysteries, like why we choose one partner over another.<\/p> <p>Almost unique among scientists,\u00a0Fisher explores the science of love without losing a sense of romance: Her work frequently invokes poetry, literature and art -- along with scientific findings -- helping us appreciate our love affair with love itself.

The party met some foes from their recent past, the demonic goblins who they discovered were in the employ of the Kraken Society and were involved in kidnapping schemes. The most devastating revelation was that an enemy troop logistical unit with minotaur defenders, orc archers and an orc wizard boss worshipped Orcus, the Demon Prince of the Undead which suggests that Orcus may be the BBEG behind the orc attacks which have plagued the Silver Marches region. A captured prisoner claimed they were preparing an assault on Silverymoon which seemed plausible given the tactical acumen shown by the orcs and their allies. Nonetheless, the party proved highly skilled in dispatching the demonspawn efficiently and quickly. In the next adventure, the party pushes on to the city of Nesme in the western reaches of the Evermoors. Finally, the party cleric had a vivid premonition of a psychic hag that might have clues to offer as to Farlien's recent travels. The party earned 1,025xp, 175gp and 5 slings &amp; ammo from the spoils of combat.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/230803524\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":14400000,"name":"D&D 5e Silvery Moon","id":"230803524","time":1463866200000,"updated":1463885862000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"61 Greenpoint Ave suite 306","name":"Gallery AWA","lon":-73.95842,"id":24412489,"lat":40.730022,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.15796947479,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460866213000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please Join us\u00a0as we share the practice of Level 1 Zhineng Qigong.<\/p> <p>Beginners are welcome to attend and learn.

When a rock musician is banned from performing at a high school Halloween dance and ends up perishing in a hotel fire, he vows vengeance on the town and comes back from beyond the grave to obliterate the population. He does this through one of his most rabid fans, the nerdy Eddie Weinbauer (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/marc-price-p57789\">Marc Price<\/a>), a high school outsider. He is such a fan that he plays the rock star's final album \"Songs in the Key of Death\" in reverse, looking for instructions on how to live his life.

It is not always guaranteed you will be able to sit in the same tables but I can guarantee you will always meet great people at these concerts and will enjoy great music :)<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/b\/f\/600_449855519.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018The Flame: Flamenco Infused Jazz\u2019 is a series of jazz flamenco concerts that showcases the work of musicians whose artistic vision, although strongly based in Jazz sounds and approaches, latches onto the roots of Flamenco.<\/p> <p>The fusion of Flamenco with the flavors of the old and new continents not only preserves this genre, but also helps to take it further into the future.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/funthingstodoinnyctoday\/events\/231017559\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":5400000,"name":"\u2018The Flame: Flamenco Infused Jazz\u2019 featuring guitarist Alberto Carri\u00f3n","id":"231017559","time":1463868000000,"updated":1463874624000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1217100557000,"name":"Alternative to the Bar Fun Things To Do In NYC Today!","group_lon":-74,"id":1235637,"urlname":"funthingstodoinnyctoday","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"NYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hoboken","address_1":"519 Washington St","name":"Aether Game Cafe","lon":-74.028984,"id":24519988,"state":"NJ","lat":40.742798,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.1048643589,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462053487000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This meetup is a place for people to come together and play lighter style, party, and social games. \u00a0Think games like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Betrayal at House on the Hill, The Resistance, or Superfight. \u00a0The focus is more on having a good time and meeting new people than playing the most competitive games that exist. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThere is a $5 per person cover charge at this venue, but that includes ample table space, and access to a selection of over 160 games.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Boardgame-Shindig\/events\/230928877\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":18000000,"name":"Community Boardgame Meetup","id":"fvwxslyvhbcc","time":1463868000000,"updated":1463886936000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1462051407000,"name":"Hoboken Boardgame Shindig","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":19901086,"urlname":"Hoboken-Boardgame-Shindig","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Boardgamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"219 Bowery","name":"Homemade ","lon":-73.993111,"id":24517225,"state":"NY","lat":40.721767,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":1.96171653271,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461908737000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/1\/1\/600_450156625.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0honor of the great musician\u00a0Prince, we are throwing a purple themed dinner party.

THE OTHER MOZART is based on facts, stories and lines pulled directly from the Mozart family's humorous and heartbreaking letters.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>With the opulent beauty of the dress and hair design, the sweet smell of perfume and the clouds of dusting powder rising from the stage, THE OTHER MOZART is a multi-sensual experience that transports the audience into a world of outsized beauty and delight - but also of overwhelming restrictions and prejudice where, finally, this other Mozart tells her story. Period style movement creates a world of opulence and elegance through articulate delicacy of expressive balletic gestures, reverent court bows, and fan language.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nMusic<\/p> <p>Along with music composed by her famous brother and Marianna Martines (a female composer who inspired Nannerl), the play features original music by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen --- featured composers of the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center, BAM and the International Contemporary Ensemble -- for the instruments Nannerl knew intimately such as clavichords, music boxes and bells, as well as teacups, fans, and other ordinary objects that might have captured her imagination.<\/p> <p>The production features music composed by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen\u00a0(of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival and the International Contemporary Ensemble) with additional music by Marianna Martines and Wolfgang A. Mozart. Sound design by Nathan Davis. Period style movement directed by Janice Orlandi. Costume design by Magdalena Dabrowska (dress) and Miodrag Guberinic (pannier \/ corset sculpture), with dress concept by Anna Sroka and hair design by Courtney Bednarowski. Lighting design by Joshua Rose.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i>Origins &amp; Performances<\/i><\/p> <p><i>THE OTHER MOZART was developed at the Piccolo Spoleto festival and at the Cherry Lane Theatre\u00a0in NYC as part of the All For One Festival. It was presented at the Berkshire and New Orleans Fringe festivals, at Toronto University and in Munich at the Pasinger Fabrik. The play repeatedly returned to Austria in 2014 at the invitation of the Mozarteum Foundation and Mozarteum University in Salzburg. The play had a critically acclaimed Off-Broadway run at the HERE Arts Center\u00a0in New York City, and in London at St. James Theater. It continues touring internationally.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAwards &amp; Nominations<\/p> <p>THE OTHER MOZART was nominated for the 2015 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Sound Design in a Play and the 2015 Off Broadway Alliance Award for Best Solo Performance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The play was nominated for eight New York Innovative Theatre Awards:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Solo Performance - Sylvia Milo,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Director - Isaac Byrne,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Costume Design - Magdalena Dabrowska &amp; Miodrag Guberinic,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Set Design - Anna Sroka,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Sound Design - Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Music - Phyllis Chen &amp; Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Full-length script - Sylvia Milo and\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Premiere Production of a Play,\u00a0<\/p> <p>winning Outstanding Solo Performance and Outstanding Original Music.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Press &amp; Articles<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.broadwayworld.com\/off-broadway\/article\/Samantha-Hoefer-to-Share-Lead-Role-in-THE-OTHER-MOZART-Off-Broadway-Starting-1024-20151020\">Broadway World<\/a> (event description largely from here).<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2015\/sep\/08\/lost-genius-the-other-mozart-sister-nannerl\">The Guardian<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/01\/theater\/the-other-mozart-at-here-arts-center.html?_r=2\">The New York Times<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-big-stars-of-experimental-theater-1402970184\">The Wall Street Journal<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theothermozart.com\/\">Official Page<\/a>\u00a0(see for more articles)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nYou must pay your tickets at using the link provided above.

He had a series of famous Italian restaurants and even operated The Rainbow Room. Vice Versa was started by a Tony May Alumni Group. Started in 1999 and Zagat rated 24, for \u201ctop notch Italian cooking in a sleek interior and a pleasant dining experience.\u201d Vice Versa is a NY Magazine Critics top pick stating, \u201cthe modern lines of Vice Versa are so (unassuming) it's easy to walk right by its storefront. Do so, and you'll be missing out on one of the most congenial and gratifying restaurants in the theater district, as well as one that's become a whispered neighborhood favorite. Like a hit play that opened with little fanfare, Vice Versa is full of diverting surprises.\u201d Owned by Franco Lazzari and Stefano Terzi, they use only the highest quality ingredients produced locally or imported from Italy. In the kitchen, Stefano makes all pasta from scratch. Stefano\u2019s cooking respects the characteristics of each ingredient and values their qualities in each recipe-a true embodiment of the philosophy of Italian Cuisine. 4.5 stars on Open Table, 4 stars on YELP, Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor.<\/p> <p>Our menu includes: garden salad with parmigiana, eggplant cannoli filled with ricotta over mixed vegetables, saltimbocca of pork loin with pancetta and sage, beef and pecorino rollatine pizzaiola with tomato, oregano and capers, sesame coated seared salmon with horseradish sour cream and spinach and of course Italian desserts.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup\/events\/230323238\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"Sold out!!!

I'm not trying to be mean but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better, but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Even if the meetup is full, please put your name on the waitlist. I will let you know if a spot becomes available. Also, if there are a lot of people on the waitlist, it lets me know which kind of restaurants are popular so that I may schedule more of those in the future. Thanks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please note that meetup events are strictly for members. No +1s are allowed as reservations are made in advance and spots are assigned. First time members must confirm in writing that they will attend. Individuals that are no shows are immediately banned from the group.

The year is 1912. The Titanic has just set sail for New York from England, yet to meet its fateful end. Parliament has introduced an Irish Home Rule bill. The aristocracy still enjoys a life of supreme privilege, residing in country manors and stately homes, surrounded by dutiful servants. Yet the wheels of democracy are moving slowly forward and life, as the nobility have known it, is beginning to change\u2026. Join us for a splendid spring dinner party complete with parasols, Pimm\u2019s Cups and punch. Dinners can expect classic dishes straight from the aristocratic tables of the old school nobility.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dishes like Galantine of Chicken, Consomm\u00e9 Royale, Whole Baked Haddock in Sharp Sauce, frothy Champagne ices and an Eton-y-inspired Mess. Each course will be paired with delectable Old World wines and stories of historical intrigue: How divided were upstairs and downstairs? Who were the most gossip-worthy socialites of the period?

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/231138380\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:30 am!","id":"hssxjlyvhbdc","time":1463923800000,"updated":1463936328000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439688959000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Start your Sunday off right!

If it's rainy or bad weather, I won't be there, but if the suns out, you can find me under the hill. I will let the group know ahead of time if I have to cancel in advance. The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together.

Huntington and his second wife, Arrabella Yarrington, who was the teen aged daughter of the proprietor of a boarding house where Collis stayed while developing railroads in Virginia. Arrabella used her husbands wealth to accumulate a large art collection, which is now housed at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, and encouraged her son Archer to pursue intellectual and artistic activities.<\/p> <p>The National Academy is an honorary association of American artists which operates a school and museum and is housed in the opulent townhouse that was Archer and Anna's home and Anna's sculpture studio. The academy is closing the museum on June 1 to sell the building to create an endowment and move to a new location. Archer established the Hispanic Society in 1904 as part of his lifelong interest in the history and culture of Spain. Archer and Anna met when he commissioned her to create a sculpture of El Cid for the courtyard of the Hispanic Society.<\/p> <p>Here is a link to the National Academy museum:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalacademy.org\/museum\/\">National Academy Museum<\/a><\/p> <p>Here is a link to the Hispanic Society web site:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hispanicsociety.org\/\">Hispanic Society<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Meet:<\/b> 11:00 in front of the National Academy museum at 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street.

The temptation to go out and buy extremely expensive lighting gear is strong, but is it necessary? That's what we're going to find out.<br\/>For the next workshop at Adorama, we will be going through the steps to create a beautiful portrait. We'll be using studio strobes and top of the line light modifiers to get a high quality shot. And the twist (because there's always a twist): we going to attempt to recreate the shot using less expensive modifiers and speed lights (flashes, flash guns or hot shoe flashes). In addition to recreating a studio shot with speed lights, we'll also go over all the steps necessary to create the portrait including creating a concept, deciding the type of lighting to use, hair style and make up that would compliment the shot.<br\/>Okay, okay . . . . there's another Adorama Gift Certificate that will be looking for a new home in someone's pocket.

The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/231167059\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"cvdgrlyvhbdc","time":1463932800000,"updated":1463945493000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":7,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457279362000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You asked for more....so Vonnegut it is.<\/p> <p>Mr. Vonnegut gave himself an \"A\" ranking this book, so at least we know it came out as he intended. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\"<i>Jailbird<\/i>\u00a0takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government\u2014and in the heart.

The angel carries a lily in her left hand \u2014\u00a0a symbol of the water's purity, very important to a city that had previously suffered from a devastating cholera epidemic before the system was established.

From the steps of Vanderbilt Gate on Fifth Avenue and 105th Street, the sweeping view of the Center Garden's formal green lawn is capped at the far end with this elegant geyser fountain. One of three stylized gardens that make up the six-acre Conservatory Garden, the Center Garden features hallmarks of its classic Italian design, geometric shaped vegetation, and fountains. The Italian garden is a popular site for wedding photography. In spring, its the fitting floral backdrop to the annual Frederick Law Olmsted Awards Luncheon of the Conservancy's Women's Committee.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Inside Conservatory Garden, East Side from 104th-106th streets; enter at Fifth Avenue and 105th street, or 106th St. gate inside Park<\/p> <p><br\/>Conservatory Garden<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/conservatory-garden-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Conservatory Garden is Central Park's six-acre formal garden. It is divided into three smaller gardens, each with a distinct style: Italian, French, and English. The Garden's main entrance is through the Vanderbilt Gate, on Fifth Avenue between 104th and 105th Streets. This magnificent iron gate, made in Paris in 1894, originally stood before the Vanderbilt mansion at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street.<\/p> <p>The Italianate center garden is composed of a large lawn surrounded by yew hedges and is bordered by two exquisite all\u00e9es of spring-blooming pink and white crabapple trees. A 12-foot high jet fountain plays on the western end of the lawn, backed by tiered hedges and stairs that lead up to a wisteria pergola. On the walkway under the pergola are medallions inscribed with the names of the original 13 states.<\/p> <p>The northern, French-style garden showcases parterres of germander and spectacular seasonal displays of spring tulips, and Korean chrysanthemums in autumn, all within an ellipse of Japanese holly. In the center is the charming Three Dancing Maidens fountain by German sculptor, Walter Schott. To the south is the very intimate English-style garden. There are five mixed borders of trees, shrubs and perennial plants, and five seasonal beds featuring spring bulbs that are followed by annual flower displays. A slope of woodland plants lines the western edge of this garden. At the center is sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh's lovely Frances Hodgeson Burnett Memorial Fountain, a tribute to the author of the children's book, The Secret Garden. The children \u2014 a girl and a boy, said to depict Mary and Dickon, the main characters from the classic \u2014 stand at one end of a small water lily pool.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Conservatory Garden is an officially designated Quiet Zone and offers a calm and colorful setting for a leisurely stroll, and intimate wedding, or an escape with a good book.<\/p> <p>For many years the garden was tended by volunteers from the Garden Club of America and in 1983 it was restored by the Central Park Conservancy.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>East Side from 104th-106th Streets.

The heart of the North Woods is the Ravine. Fallen trees, or snags, are left where they land (unless hazardous or obscuring paths), providing nutrients to surrounding plants, homes to wildlife and a natural look to the landscape.<\/p> <p>Once entering through the magnificent rustic Glen Span Arch at the eastern edge of the Pool (between 100th and 103rd Streets), Park visitors are treated to a view of the Loch, a stream rebuilt by the Conservancy in the 1990s. The North Woods is a favorite spot of birdwatchers and hikers. Free guided tours are available regularly. You can learn more about the North Woods, and the Park's other woodlands (the Ramble and the Hallett Nature Sanctuary), through one of our Woodland Discovery Programs.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>East Side to Mid-Park from 101nd - 110nd Streets.<\/p> <p><br\/>Blockhouse<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/blockhouse-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Central Park's oldest building, the Blockhouse is also the only remaining fortification of the many built in 1814 to defend against the British. It stands on the edge of a high precipice above the lower topography of Harlem. The rugged stone structure once had a sunken wooden roof and mobile cannon that could be deployed quickly. Today, the Blockhouse is empty, roofless, and securely locked.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side at 109th Street and Central Park West.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare Garden<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/shakespeare-garden-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shakespeare Garden is a four-acre landscape is named for the famed English poet and playwright. The garden is features flowers and plants mentioned in his poems and plays, with small bronze plaques scattered throughout the garden with quotes from the Bard.<\/p> <p>The garden was first conceived in the 1880s when park commissioner George Clausen asked the Park's entomologist to create a garden adjacent to the nature study center in the Swedish Cottage. In 1913, Commissioner Gaynor dedicated it officially to the works of Shakespeare. After years of neglect, Shakespeare Garden, just as most of Central Park, fell into disrepair. In 1987, Central Park Conservancy restored and expanded the garden, repaving pathways and installing rustic wooden benches and bronze plaques with quotations from the Bard's masterpiece.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>West Side between 79th and 80th Streets.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Ramble<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/assets\/images\/2014\/things-to-see-and-do\/Ramble-750.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To use the words of Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted, The Ramble is a 38-acre \"wild garden.\" \u00a0Central Park's designers imagined a tranquil spot where visitors could stroll, discover forest gardens rich with plantings, and meander along the paths. This truly is a place for the urban explorer to escape the city and get utterly lost in nature.<\/p> <p>This was one of the first parts of the Park to be built, and except for the bedrock platform, it is totally artificial. Even the water running in the stream and the adjacent Lake is turned on and off like a faucet. Some of the trees you see date back to 1859 when the Ramble was planted.<\/p> <p>Beneath the leafy canopy, you are surrounded by a thriving wildlife habitat. Because of its location on the Atlantic Flyway \u2014\u00a0the migration route birds follow in the spring and fall \u2014 the Ramble is the center of birding activity in the Park. Over 230 species have been spotted, and over 40 other species remain in the Park all year long.<\/p> <p>Every year, more than 25 million people visit Central Park, which is more than any other urban Park in the world. By working with environmental groups, the Central Park Conservancy has developed a woodland restoration and management plan, which involves your participation as well.<\/p> <p>First, \"carry in, carry out.\" \u00a0All of the trash and recycling bins have been removed from inside the Ramble, and placed at the entrances. If you enjoy a picnic in this beautiful setting, don't forget to take your leftovers with you and dispose of them properly. It's a simple gesture, but it really helps the environment and the Conservancy staff responsible for its care.<\/p> <p>Location<\/p> <p>Mid-Park from 73rd to 79th Streets.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/maps\/index.html?attraction=506619071\">\u00bb Map It<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nBelvedere Castle<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.centralparknyc.org\/visit\/things-to-see\/images\/belvedere-l.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Calvert Vaux, co-designer of Central Park, created the miniature castle in 1869 as one of its many whimsical structures intended as a lookout to the reservoir to the north (now the Great Lawn) and the Ramble to the south. Belvedere provides the best and highest views of the Park and its cityscape. It's fitting, considering its name translates to \"beautiful view\" in Italian.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\"Right now, the temperature in Central Park is...\" Since 1919, the National Weather Service has taken measurements onf New York's weather from the castle's tower with the aid of scientific instruments that measure wind speed and direction. In a fenced-in compound just south of the castle, other data such as the rainfall is recorded and sent to the weather service's forecast office at Brookhaven National Library on Long Island.

After the Park Commission acquired the riverfront properties, it built a number of pavilions to serve as dance halls for the crowds of picnickers and campers who came to the park from New York City and elsewhere. The Alpine Pavilion, where the barn dance will be held, built during the Depression years, continued that tradition. The ground floor was dedicated to changing rooms for a Hudson River bathing beach that was then in operation at the site. But the second story was set up for dancing, with a beautiful hardwood floor. \u201cYou really get a chance to touch a part of America\u2019s past when you give this a try, especially in a setting like this,\u201d Nelsen said. \u201cAnd Dave is an amazing teacher.

I\u2019m limiting the number of people who can attend, so that I can spend time with each of you to help with anything you need in getting really compelling images of the sites that we visit along the way. That can range from basic photo or camera help to assistance with composition and advanced techniques.<\/p> <p>Also, as an\u00a0added value, you'll be able to send me your photos (or links to them) from this workshop for evaluation and feedback. I'll make comments and suggestions, and in many cases, do some photo editing on your photos to demonstrate how to make a good image even better.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our first stop will be Strawberry Fields, an intimate haven just inside the park set aside as a memorial to John Lennon. From there, we\u2019ll circumnavigate The Lake to take advantage of panoramic views with the elegant skylines of Central Park West or Fifth Avenue in the background.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll \u201cget lost\u201d in The Ramble, a bucolic, forested tract with a picturesque stream and rustic bridges where, for the moment, you can imagine that the city is far away.<\/p> <p>Finally, we\u2019ll arrive at Bethesda Terrace, an iconic, romantic plaza that you\u2019ll recognize from countless movies. We\u2019ll explore the Terrace from the grand sweep of its monumental staircases to the intricate carvings of honeybees and birds along its steps.<\/p> <p>All together, we'll see 30 unique and photogenic features in the heart of Central Park, and along the way, Steve will regale you with stories of the Park and the specific sites we'll visit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It will be a journey that will delight your sense of color, texture, and proportion as well as refresh your spirit.<\/p> <p><i>Note: If you are new to photography or could use a refresher on topics like f-stops, depth of field, basic composition, etc, I will conduct a free pre-tour session on those topics 45 minutes prior to the listed starting time of this photo tour. \u00a0Message me once you have signed up if you would like to attend.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be holding a sign near the first park bench closest to the southeast corner of CPW at W. 72nd Street","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ShutterbugExcursionsNY\/events\/230790901\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Heart of the Park: Central Park Photo Workshop - with Bonus!","id":"230790901","time":1463943600000,"updated":1463962270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449769520000,"name":"Shutterbug Excursions NY","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19200792,"urlname":"ShutterbugExcursionsNY","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Shutterbugs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.868552923203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461896966000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come get creative while getting to know yourself and a few others along the way.\u00a0<\/p> <p>No-pressure setting to do a little writing and some sharing if you'd like.<\/p> <p>-----------<\/p> <p>We'll work on some exercises that get you thinking outside of the box and writing even if you aren't feeling very creative or inspired.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You're free to write whatever style you'd like - poetry, short story, prose, a list ...\u00a0<\/p> <p>We just want to help facilitate some ideas and content while enjoying good vibes and some craft cocktails.<\/p> <p>------------<\/p> <p>Come light.

Be sure to post a comment with which wine you will be bringing so that we can have a variety of bottles.

Early on it is clear that Addie has a rebellious streak, joining the library group and running away to Rockport Lodge. Is Addie right to disobey her parents? Where does she get her courage?<\/p> <p>2. Addie\u2019s mother refuses to see Celia\u2019s death as anything but an accident, and Addie comments that \"whenever I heard my mother\u2019s version of what happened, I felt sick to my stomach\" (page 94). Did Celia commit suicide? How might the guilt that Addie feels differ from the guilt her mother feels?<\/p> <p>3. When Addie tries on pants for the first time, she feels emotionally as well as physically liberated, and confesses that she would like to go to college (page 108). How does the social significance of clothing and hairstyle differ for Addie, Gussie, and Filomena in the book?<\/p> <p>4. Diamant fills her narrative with a number of historical events and figures, from the psychological effects of World War I and the pandemic outbreak of influenza in 1918 to child labor laws to the cultural impact of Betty Friedan. How do real-life people and events affect how we read Addie\u2019s fictional story?<\/p> <p>5. Gussie is one of the most forward-thinking characters in the novel; however, despite her law degree she has trouble finding a job as an attorney because \"no one would hire a lady lawyer\" (page 145). What other limitations do Addie and her friends face in the work force? What limitations do women and\/or minorities face today?<\/p> <p>6. After distancing herself from Ernie when he suffers a nervous episode brought on by combat stress, Addie sees a community of war veterans come forward to assist him (page 155). What does the remorse that Addie later feels suggest about the challenges American soldiers face as they reintegrate into society? Do you think soldiers today face similar challenges?<\/p> <p>7. Addie notices that the Rockport locals seem related to one another, and the cook Mrs. Morse confides in her sister that, although she is usually suspicious of immigrant boarders, \"some of them are nicer than Americans\" (page 167). How does tolerance of the immigrant population vary between city and town in the novel? For whom might Mrs. Morse reserve the term \"Americans\"?<\/p> <p>8. Addie is initially drawn to Tessa Thorndike because she is a Boston Brahmin who isn\u2019t afraid to poke fun at her own class on the women\u2019s page of the newspaper. What strengths and weaknesses does Tessa\u2019s character represent for educated women of the time? How does Addie\u2019s description of Tessa bring her reliability into question?<\/p> <p>9. Addie\u2019s parents frequently admonish her for being ungrateful, but Addie feels she has earned her freedom to move into a boarding house when her parents move to Roxbury, in part because she contributed to the family income (page 185). How does the Baum family move to Roxbury show the ways Betty and Addie think differently than their parents about household roles? Why does their father take such offense at Harold Levine\u2019s offer to house the family?<\/p> <p>10. The last meaningful conversation between Addie and her mother turns out to be an apology her mother meant for Celia, and for a moment during her mother\u2019s funeral Addie thinks, \"She won\u2019t be able to make me feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me anymore\" (page 276). Does Addie find any closure from her mother\u2019s death?<\/p> <p>11. Filomena draws a distinction between love and marriage when she spends time catching up with Addie before her wedding, but Addie disagrees with the assertion that \"you only get one great love in a lifetime\" (page 289). In what ways do the different romantic experiences of each woman inform the ideas each has about love?<\/p> <p>12. Filomena and Addie share a deep friendship. Addie tells Ada that \"sometimes friends grow apart\u2026But sometimes, it doesn\u2019t matter how far apart you live or how little you talk\u2014it\u2019s still there\" (page 283). What qualities do you think friends must share in order to have that kind of connection?\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Usually in the room to the right of the registers (when looking at registers)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-1059\/events\/229845629\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Discussion of The Boston Girl by Anita Diamant","id":"229845629","time":1463958000000,"updated":1464177275000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1196884090000,"name":"The Woodbridge\/Edison Book Club Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.2900009155,"id":860038,"urlname":"bookclub-1059","group_lat":40.5600013733,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York City","address_1":"138 West 29th Street","name":"Pioneers Bar NYC","lon":-73.991745,"id":17146172,"state":"NY","lat":40.747345,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.205546021461,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431915635000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Thanks for coming out, literally and figuratively!

I've been living with these frequencies since 1998 and growing and evolving in my personal life as well as using this healing as part of my service for others. I love the flavors that these energies contain - there is Cosmic electricity that can move things along, breakthrough blockages, and inspire changes in your psyche and life around you.<br\/>You will hear about the history of this modality and get to experience it in a guided meditation and group downloading of the energy. The least you experience and perceive is a relaxing state od being - you may however experience your consciousness expanding, freeing you from outmoded mental concepts and beliefs that no longer serve you. Are you ready to take a ride into this rainbow sunrise of your new life?<br\/>See you there!<\/p> <p>Love and Light,<\/p> <p>Karuna<br\/>Seichim Master Teacher<\/p> <p>\u201cAll human beings are capable of emitting healing energy from the center of their palms. We can see by our auric field that our bodies are conduits of a vaster energy. We all know on some level that we can heal ourselves. After the initiations in Seichim, you will remember this in a whole new way. You will also see how you can infuse others with this healing energy*.<br\/>Seichim is a conscious, Universal, multi-spectrum energy. It is an ancient system of healing wisdom translated from Egyptian hieroglyphics into Sanskrit. Seichim, the word is used to designate both the energy itself and the healing system, which uses this conscious energy.<br\/>We are all born with a connection to these Universal energies. The initiations allow us to conduct, in a very conscious way, vast amounts of this power. The Seichim frequencies are powerful tools for growth and transformation. The energy can also be used in many healing modalities (the Quartz Crystal Bowls, copper devices, homeopathy, color therapy, etc.).<br\/>The ancient masters of Seichim revealed the existence of seven facets. Seichim Master Teachers are empowered to pass on all of these facets. Each facet is unique and complete within itself. The facets build on experience from preceding facets. Anyone becoming an initiate of any facet has complete, permanent empowerment of the unique attributes of that level. No further action or involvement with any organization is required.<br\/>Each initiation triggers healing, cleansing and balancing in the initiate. This is a powerful energy and individual exploration time varies. Once initiated, a practitioner\u2019s life starts moving forward quickly. It becomes full of new experiences and opportunities to share and enjoy the energy in each of its unique aspects.\"<br\/>- The Seven Facets of Seichim by R.

Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup. Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FREE-or-inexpensive-things-to-do-on-Long-Island\/events\/231275942\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup 2 Drink Min.","id":"231275942","time":1463959800000,"updated":1463972906000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374770590000,"name":"FREE or inexpensive things to do in New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":9513972,"urlname":"FREE-or-inexpensive-things-to-do-on-Long-Island","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Cheap-we-are"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"18 W 33rd St","address_2":"Between 5th and 6th ave","lon":-73.986519,"phone":"212-290-0080","name":"Foley's Pub","id":781445,"state":"NY","lat":40.748158,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.222603023052,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463586609000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>By virtue of Sidney Crosby's overtime goal and the Pens' Game 2 win, we are assured of at least a Game 5 back in Pittsburgh in this series.

A year and a half of front pages later in 1976, Willens joined the Associated Press as one of their first female photographers.

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LOA-NYC\/events\/230853964\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"tlmvslyvhbfc","time":1464040800000,"updated":1464052667000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1171915610000,"name":"\"Law of Attraction NYC - Awaken Your Genie\"","group_lon":-74,"id":432762,"urlname":"LOA-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Powerful Attractors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":26,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460813108000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Organization fee","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/5\/2\/600_436315122.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>What day is today?

In our modern moment Agile and Scrum are tossed around by leaders as the newest management fad. What leadership has to recognize is that this requires not only changes in their organizations, but changes in themselves. The world of today is undergoing a rapid transition from one phase to another, and those leaders who cannot fundamentally shift how they view the world, their companies, and the way they think about work itself simply won't make it. As one evolutionist put it in 1964, \"It is not the strongest species that survives, or the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/0\/2\/600_449826914.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jj-sutherland-b1486b6\">JJ Sutherland<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jjsutherland\">@jjsutherland<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Cost: Free thanks to sponsors<\/p> <p>Sponsor(s):<\/p> <p>Thank you to our sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/becteam.com\/\">Berkana Enterprise Consulting<\/a>\u00a0 and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/excella.com\/\">Excella Consulting<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/a\/0\/600_447713408.jpeghttp:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/8\/b\/600_444146507.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Don't forget to \"like\" either our Facebook and\/or LinkedIn page for a chance to win an \"Agile Related book\".\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/becteam\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/becteam\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/becteam<\/a><\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/becteam\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/becteam\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/becteam<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>BEC is HIRING: We are looking for Agile Coaches &amp; Scrum Masters all over the US.

The suddenly,\u00a0they\u00a0were tasked with ferrying one of these mysterious items and the courier carrying it to somewhere it would be safe.<\/p> <p><br\/>They learned quickly that numerous were those with interest in what they\u00a0possessed. Their mission was immediately fraught with danger and the party was running for its life. Then, just as quickly as it had started, it was over. The adventurers became separated from many in their group including Melrick, the wizard that had hired them to protect his journey.<\/p> <p><br\/>They passed\u00a0through\u00a0an alien realm they\u00a0soon\u00a0became certain was the dark realm known as the Shadowfell. Their stay on the plane of shadow was short-lived, however, and\u00a0they soon found themselves back in the natural world. But they were very far from home and a number of their comrades were not with them.<\/p> <p><br\/>What will Robin, Meline, Trask, Poe, Zyle, and Malako do now? Do they try to reunite with their mates and finish their mission? If so, how will they go about finding them? These are questions they all ponder and one of their number does so along with the realization that they\u2019ve arrived at his homeland. A homeland he had\u00a0left nearly two decades prior swearing to only return when he had made his fortune.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Pursuit of Power\" is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the first and third Thursdays of each month. We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Monday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game. This game will run in parallel with the\u00a0\u201cKeeper of the Keys\u201d game with my hope being both groups can meet for a massive gaming session every now and again.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/229795629\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"In Pursuit of Power - An Azocar Adventure","id":"kfvsrlyvhbvb","time":1464042600000,"updated":1464054183000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Springfield","address_1":"595 Morris Ave","name":"Scotty's Steak House","lon":-74.325691,"id":23970419,"lat":40.71714,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.7574539185,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422937095000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our weekly Meet Up will take place at Scotty's Steakhouse and Comedy Cove in Springfield, just a bit off of exit 9B on Route 24!

This course provides the basics you need to get started building an Angular 2 application. First, you'll learn how to set up your environment, learning about components, templates, and data binding and how they work together. Next, you'll discover how to build clean components with strongly-typed code, as well as building nested components and how to use dependency injection to inject the services you build. Finally, you'll cover how to retrieve data using HTTP, navigation and routing, and you'll revisit the Angular 2 setup process. By the end of this course, you'll be up to date on all the latest Angular 2 knowledge and you'll be able to use Angular 2 to create great apps in the future.<\/p> <p><b>About the Author:<\/b>\u00a0Deborah Kurata is an independent consultant with over 15 years of experience in designing and developing successful Microsoft .NET applications as well as mentoring software developers.

We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition.

The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

But can physical sciences solve the biggest mystery\u2014the emergence of human consciousness? Can consciousness be reduced to electrical and chemical processes that occur in a vast, intricately connected collection of neurons? This panel will bring together physicists, historians, cognitive scientists, and mathematicians to explore the questions: Does consciousness emerge solely from matter? Does consciousness cease completely when biological systems supporting it stop functioning? Does today's science possess tools to answer these questions definitively? And when we obtain answers to these questions, what are the implications for human existence and ethics?

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan.\u00a0\u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014<\/p> <p><br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014 \u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

It was first published in Strand Magazine in 1893 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget.<br\/>One of Doyle's sentimental pieces, the story is remarkable in that Holmes' deduction during the course of it proves incorrect. (Nevertheless, the truth still comes out.) According to Dr. Watson:<br\/>\"...where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded... Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Synopsis<br\/>Sherlock Holmes, suffering from boredom due to a want of cases, returns home from a walk with Dr. Watson early in spring to find he has missed a visitor, but that the caller has left his pipe behind. From it, Holmes deduces that he was disturbed of mind (because he forgot the pipe); that he valued it highly (because he had repaired, rather than replaced, it when it was broken); that he was muscular, left-handed, had excellent teeth, was careless in his habits and was well-off.<br\/>None of these deductions is particularly germane to the story: they are merely Holmesian logical exercises. When the visitor, Mr. Grant Munro (whose name Holmes observed from his hatband) returns, Holmes and Watson hear the story of Munro's deception by his wife Effie. She had been previously married in America, but her husband and child had died of yellow fever, whereupon she returned to England and met and married Munro. Their marriage had been blissful \u2014 \"We have not had a difference, not one, in thought, or word, or deed,\" says Grant Munro \u2014 until she asked for a hundred pounds and begged him not to ask why. Two months later, Effie Munro was caught conducting secret liaisons with the occupants of a cottage near the Munro house in Norbury.<br\/>Grant Munro has seen a mysterious yellow-faced person in this cottage. Overcome with jealousy, he breaks in and finds the place empty. However, the room where he saw the mysterious figure is very comfortable and well-furnished, with a portrait of his wife on the mantelpiece.<br\/>Holmes, after sending Munro home with instructions to wire for him if the cottage was reoccupied, confides in Watson his belief that the mysterious figure is Effie Munro's first husband. He postulates that the husband, having been left in America, has come to England to blackmail her.<br\/>After Munro summons Holmes and Watson, the three enter the cottage, brushing aside the entreaties of Effie Munro. They find the strange yellow-faced character; Holmes peels that face away, showing it to be a mask and revealing a young black girl. Effie Munro's first husband was John Hebron, a black man; he did die in America, but the couple's daughter Lucy survived. Afraid that Grant Munro would repudiate his love for her if he knew she was mother to a mixed race child, she had endeavored to keep Lucy's existence hidden. Overcome with desire to see her child again, Effie Munro used the hundred pounds to bring Lucy and her nurse to England and installed them in the cottage near the Munro house.<br\/>Both Watson and Holmes are touched by Munro's response. Watson observes:<br\/>...when [Munro's] answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. \"We can talk about it more comfortably at home,\" said he. \"I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.\"<br\/>Holmes says:<br\/>\"Watson, if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little overconfident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Adventure_of_the_Yellow_Face\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Adventure_of_the_Yellow_Face<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/221BNYC\/events\/231068341\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\"","id":"231068341","time":1464127200000,"updated":1464281569000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422585389000,"name":"221B NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18394372,"urlname":"221BNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sherlockians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012-3218","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1 W 3rd Street (btwn Broadway & Mercer)","name":"W 3rd Common","lon":-73.99839,"id":4287212,"state":"NY","lat":40.724869,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":1.79483389854,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437605885000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The next Pints 'n' Purls meetup will be at W 3rd Common\u00a0(1 W 3rd Street, between Broadway &amp; Mercer) from 6-9 pm, drop in any time you like.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/231227498\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvhbgc","time":1464127200000,"updated":1464138954000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"292 Graham Ave","name":"Action Burger","lon":-73.944008,"id":22635272,"lat":40.712231,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.55804038048,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438502043000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Random Anime night; And Cards against humanity, Uno, Spades, Monopoly, chess, scrabble, Operation, battleship, dominoes night.<\/p> <p>Happy hour special for meetup RSVP members only, all evening:<\/p> <p>3 shots for $5.<br\/>32oz rum and coke $10.<br\/>Buy a beer, get a free shot. $20 Rum &amp; coke, open bar for 2 hours.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/230886176\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvhbgc","time":1464129000000,"updated":1464141721000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nanuet","address_1":"119 Main St., 2nd Floor","name":"Rockland County Makerspace @CILK119","lon":-74.012962,"id":23685653,"state":"NY","lat":41.092907,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.7712497711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456583522000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Rockland County Makerspace offers weekly Arduino workshops with Dr. Duncan Bell, who has extensive experience in building many types of Arduino-based projects.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Bell will bring multiple types of Arduinos and shields, motors and lights, and even computers for the attendees to play with in a hands-on environment.
