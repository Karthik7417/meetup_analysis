If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

Campos<\/p>\n<p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<\/p>\n<p>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<\/p>\n<p>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from <br> these Luso-African countries.<\/p>\n<p>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England. Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<\/p>\n<p>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<\/p>\n<p>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<\/p>\n<p>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way: Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists.

After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs.

The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.

I'm Francesca - a 45 year old mom living in Maplewood. As a plus-sized woman, it's harder for me to find a network of like-minded women who come across the same challenges as I do in life... everything from shopping for clothes, to fitting in movie theater seats, to exercise. Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace. The experience is often sublime, and always tailored to exactly what it is that you need next in your life.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/5\/5\/highres_256741877.jpeg","photo_id":256741877,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/5\/5\/member_256741877.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/5\/5\/thumb_256741877.jpeg"}},"members":165,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423514461000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"lunch","name":"Lunch","id":19892},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"meet-for-lunches","name":"Meet for Lunches","id":28189},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Focused-Networking-Happy-Hours-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi all!

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play.

This group has something for everyone who loves to craft with paper. Learn some tips and tricks from a Stampin' Up! Professional, while hanging out with new friends making cards, hand made gifts and more!! The possibilities are endless... I like to call these events \"Girl's Night Out\" because I want you to feel like you are pampered!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy teaching new techniques, stamping with my friends, and making various home decor items using rubber stamps, die cuts, and beautiful papers.  Join my monthly classes for inspiration, socialization, or to learn something new!  \n\nI have several ideas for upcoming meetups -- some will be classes where we will make several cards or a home decor item, and others will be an open house style where you can each bring your own paper crafting projects, and you can use all of my non-consumables such as punches, the Big Shot die cutting machine (and all the many dies I have), stamps, and ink.  I will provide great snacks (usually involves CHOCOLATE in one form or another) and drinks, and assist you with your creative projects.  Each class will be priced according to materials involved.\nI hope you will join me and I look forward to meeting some new friends who share this hobby!\n\nStampingly,\n\nSelene Ferguson","lon":-73.5899963379,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184446280,"name":"Selene Ferguson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/highres_244070559.jpeg","photo_id":244070559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/member_244070559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/thumb_244070559.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"South Shore Stampin Haven","id":18435309,"state":"NY","urlname":"South-Shore-Stampin-Haven","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Stampers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424008402000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"italiancar","name":"Italian Cars","id":4595},{"urlkey":"britishcars","name":"British Cars","id":10826},{"urlkey":"sports-cars","name":"Sports Cars","id":15179},{"urlkey":"car-enthusiasts","name":"Car Enthusiasts","id":16333},{"urlkey":"cars","name":"Cars","id":20578},{"urlkey":"custom-cars","name":"Custom Cars","id":20579},{"urlkey":"exotic-cars","name":"Exotic Cars","id":27721},{"urlkey":"european-cars","name":"European Cars","id":28352}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCExotics\/","rating":0,"description":"Where exotics ignite passion; passion to drive, passion for the streets; exhaust notes like a grand symphony in the busy streets of NYC!

Please read the description all the way down, thank you.<\/p>\n<p> I am a new business owner in the Central NJ area and this group is for my fellow new female business owners and\/or professionals that are transitioning into entrepreneurship. Mastermind groups offer a combination of brainstorming, education, peer accountability, and support in a group setting to sharpen your business and personal skills. The main purpose of this group is to hold each member accountable to her goals, provide access to information\/resources, and support. How may we serve you? <br><\/p>\n<p>This group is for success-minded ladies who take full responsibility for their lives and are focused on solutions. We are made up of a diverse array of women. We will be small so we can develop a real community and connection. <br><\/p>\n<p>*This group is not a company, we are not peddling services or products, and our meetings will not serve as a platform to advertise any companies or businesses*. <br><\/p>\n<p>How it will work - The Roundtable <br><\/p>\n<p>This group will meet at least once a week. Each lady will take a turn and speak about what she is working on, goals, and with what she needs help. Whenever a person is speaking, everybody else will be respectful and listen to her without judgment. Then for the next 20-30 minutes, the rest of us will brainstorm, share ideas, solutions, and constructive feedback towards a solution for her. Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other. Come prepared to laugh, form friendships, and have intelligent discussions with other incredible females.\ufeff<\/p>","lon":-74.4000015259,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/highres_434510516.jpeg","photo_id":434510516,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/600_434510516.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/thumb_434510516.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11814005,"name":"Udochi E.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/highres_9340826.jpeg","photo_id":9340826,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/member_9340826.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/thumb_9340826.jpeg"}},"members":96,"name":"Millionaire Ladies' Mastermind Group","id":18450412,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Millionaire-Ladies-Mastermind-Group","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.5099983215,"who":"Incredible Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Beach","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424529156000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sportsfans","name":"Sports Fan","id":83},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"ultimatefrisbee","name":"Ultimate Frisbee","id":2077},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"long-beach","name":"long beach","id":19288},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"freestyle-frisbee","name":"Freestyle Frisbee","id":84705},{"urlkey":"co-ed-ultimate-frisbee","name":"Co-ed Ultimate Frisbee","id":88542},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"frisbee-other-pick-up-sports","name":"Frisbee & Other Pick-up Sports","id":1455832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Frisbee-Toss-Long-Beach\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you love the sun, sand and surf?

We have two families who recently have moved into the city to share our love with the people here. We originated as a result of day trips into the city for a number of years to share the light of the gospel. As we made acquaintances here, they requested a church where we could meet together. We started out as a one Sunday a month Bible study and as more interest grew we became a local body of believers with church services every Sunday and some services in the week. In June of 2014 we moved a pastor into the Bronx. Our congregation consists of the two families here, two families and some youth who drive in from Pennsylvania, and a number of dedicated people from the city. A personal note from the pastor:<br>Hi there! I am Tim. I was born in 1976. My brother (my co-pastor) and I are in the middle of six children. Today of those six, two are missionaries in Honduras, two of us are involved in the church plant here in the Bronx, and two are settled in Pennsylvania.

Here is what sets this group apart: <br><\/p>\n<p>1). We will typically have 1-3 meals per week. Some weeks will have more and some will have less. So far we have averaged around 2 per week. <br><\/p>\n<p>2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue. <br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity. I will cover all the meetup fees for now. If anyone wants to contribute feel free to but for now I am not going to ask.<\/p>\n<p> 4). A lot of groups seem to do the same activities or go to the same places over and over again. I will find new and exciting places to try that have good write ups and reviews. That being said, I am always open to member suggestions, so please send me suggestions of places you want to go. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you join the group and we can have a lot of fun exploring the amazing NYC food scene.

Yet, they use spiritual and other supernatural means to control and dominate the planet all the while conspiring to limit your potential as a divine being. They have subversively replaced our moral values given to us by our ancient ancestors with the worship of satanism, sex, money, materialism, militarism, power, racism, and sexism. They have further replaced true spiritualism with religious dogma and the belief in the five senses (physical existence) only. In fact, they are the chief architects of many of the planets conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Project Illuminated is a global effort to reveal the truth of our existence and show you how to create a new reality. One where you don't need to protest, amass a military like arsenal of weapons or get into wars to change the direction of the world. The powerful and free information as presented through this group will reveal the secrets of the universe that will help revolutionize our current thought process.

We can get to know each other if we commit to meeting in person. So your participation in at least two meet ups a year is required to remain in the group. We are a collective group and members are encouraged to post at least one meet-up event a year. This is a great way to keep our group active. We are very much looking forward to meeting you and your family. See you soon.<\/p>","lon":-73.6900024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/8\/7\/highres_435329575.jpeg","photo_id":435329575,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/8\/7\/600_435329575.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/8\/7\/thumb_435329575.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":90897732,"name":"cherie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/9\/7\/d\/highres_252591581.jpeg","photo_id":252591581,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/9\/7\/d\/member_252591581.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/9\/7\/d\/thumb_252591581.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Playgroup for LBGT Parents & their Kids.Birth-5yrs","id":18506618,"state":"NY","urlname":"Gay-Parents-of-Long-Island-the-5-Boroughs","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Parents"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426560087000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"camping","name":"Camping","id":374},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"photography-classes","name":"Photography Classes","id":15043},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Nature-and-Conservation-Photography-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you love adventure travel, the outdoors, and photography?

Working with a life coach, you'll have someone asking you all the right questions, shining light on what you want, and help you find strategies that work with your lifestyle to make things possible. Key word - You. Although you can hire us to do some of the work for you, we love to lead the horse to the water so it can drink for life (if you catch our drift). Feel free to ask us what our extra services are!<\/p>\n<p><b>Are these group meetings?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Guess what - this is anything you want it to be. For the love of networking you'll see us set up brainstorming sessions, but most of our members prefer to schedule a one-on-one meeting to be selfish and talk all about themselves for an hour (which we 100% love and encourage). If you like to pick brains and see how others work, group meet-ups are for you, but if you want to get the most of your meetings, one-on-ones are perfect to hone in on what you want so you can leave with tons of material to work with.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where do you meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our New York staple is any Think Coffee shop. We've also met at hotel lounges, and other coffee bars. Feel free to share some of your favorite spots to meet. We love shaking it up!<\/p>\n<p>Best part, you can schedule phone calls. Most of our super-humans have jobs and would like to set up a call when it's most convenient for them. This way you make the most of your time, and can handle business at home in your PJ's and easily jump in and out of our meeting. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What does it cost and how do we pay?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Best $30 you will spend on yourself for an hour of coaching.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All meetings will be finalized once you pay through&nbsp;Paypal&nbsp;(katiegonzalez@bellsouth.net).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we meet in person and you do not have&nbsp;Paypal, cash is&nbsp;accepted.<\/p>\n<p><b>How effective is this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>One meeting is inspiring. Setting up a month long plan will get you results. Ask us about our challenges.<\/p>\n<p><b>How do both meetings work?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>Meetings are driven to inspire action. We examine what exists, list what needs to be incorporated and improved, plan priorities, and tackle one goal at a time.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>Turning an idea into reality is fun, and we want our clients to feel confident every time we meet. You can think out loud, be messy, find a center and then piece together how you can make things happen. We believe our process will help you achieve great results. <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>1. <b>Talk<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is your time to be selfish and talk all about all things you and how you want to start developing your vision.<\/p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<b>Define<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Next, we pin-point your priorities based off of what you\u2019ll see instant results from, and work up to the tougher goals you\u2019re intimidated to tackle.

If you're someone who has been curious about intuition but turned off by the \"woo-woo\", then you're in the right place. We'll focus on tangible ways to tap into your intuition, and you'll be able to start using it immediately!","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":165787102,"name":"Judith","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/c\/e\/highres_226091982.jpeg","photo_id":226091982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/c\/e\/member_226091982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/c\/e\/thumb_226091982.jpeg"}},"members":75,"name":"Tangible Intuition NYC","id":18518599,"state":"NY","urlname":"Tangible-Intuition-NYC","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Practical Intuitives"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427229817000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"android","name":"Android","id":19724},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"job-search","name":"Job Search","id":21900},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"ios","name":"iOS","id":106382},{"urlkey":"mobile-user-experience","name":"Mobile User Experience","id":122974},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"technology-jobs","name":"Technology jobs","id":755712}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Mobile-JOBS-Meetup-Hosted-by-TTS\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>TTS Mobile is the most prominent Mobile Jobs Portal in NYC.

Recently our country has been facing so many identity crises. Especially when it comes to racism, our broken justice system, police and state-sanctioned violence against men and women of color and in general, discrimination against LGBTQ, endless wars, occupied people and income inequality. The list goes on and on.

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/highres_244821015.jpeg","photo_id":244821015,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/member_244821015.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/thumb_244821015.jpeg"}},"members":32,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

I consider myself a queer a a result of how I dress and interact with the gender I am attracted to.

Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

Our current members are from Nigeria, Japan, Korea, Denmark, Great Britain, India, Belgium, and the U.S. Our repertoire is always growing in response to the interests of the group. In the past few years we have sung music from South Africa, the U.S., Bulgaria, Ireland, Japan, and more. We\u2019ve sung in several South African languages, Bengali, Japanese, Bulgarian, French, Yiddish, Croatian, and English. While there are no auditions required to join the choir, we do work very hard to develop our group sound and to be true to the music, as we engage with each new song. Our rehearsals are joyful, playful, and very focused. We welcome anyone who can sing in tune, is willing to put time into learning their parts during the week using the practice tapes our director provides, and who can come to most of our Sunday afternoon rehearsals. We meet on the UWS and Washington Heights.&nbsp;If you're interested in learning more about the choir, or attending a rehearsal, contact Rebecca at <a href=\"mailto:cityworldmusic@gmail.com\">cityworldmusic@gmail.com<\/a>.

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

I believe that connecting should be based on deep compatibility and I'm only interested in serving our members in the most classy and respectful way.

Just by showing up and paying the entry free you are supporting a local musician or band. Typically cover charges go directly to a performing act once a minimum threshold has been met by the host venue.
