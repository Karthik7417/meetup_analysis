Just like driving a car it becomes second nature over time, but you must practice, practice, practice! <br><\/p>\n<p>What I learn I like to share with others, because it helps me become a better photographer. We can all learn from each other, share tips, and support each other in our efforts to become better photographers. If you don't try, you can't fail, and if you don't fail, you can't learn. Let's get together and make it happen! Join us for events, and 1 on 1 sessions; we will be visiting various locations in NYC, as well as participate in seminars, and exhibitions.<\/p>\n<p>This group is fee-based (pay-to-play), because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve as motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth. <br><\/p>\n<p>I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered. Besides being a full-time mama, I am a facilitator and organizer of sacred ceremony as well as a shamanic practitioner, Reiki master, yoga teacher and BodyTalk practitioner.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/highres_440357671.jpeg","photo_id":440357671,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/600_440357671.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/thumb_440357671.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":473,"name":"AYAM Healing with Plants","id":18780380,"state":"NY","urlname":"AYAMHealingwithPlants","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438121636000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"cities","name":"Cities","id":69931},{"urlkey":"smart-city","name":"Smart City","id":72764},{"urlkey":"sustainable-cities","name":"Sustainable Cities","id":146918},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Join us if you are passionate about cities, think that public spending should be more open to new solutions and that cities should be amazing problem-solvers.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":128652852,"name":"Sascha Haselmayer","photo":{"photo_id":170891702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/member_170891702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/thumb_170891702.jpeg"}},"members":54,"name":"Procurement 2.2 - Transform the way cities solve problems","id":18780723,"state":"NY","urlname":"Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438131971000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"green-living","name":"Green Living","id":15398},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","id":15998},{"urlkey":"eco-conscious","name":"Eco-Conscious","id":16816},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"environmental-activism","name":"Environmental Activism","id":18721},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"environmental-awareness","name":"Environmental Awareness","id":23842},{"urlkey":"light-workers","name":"Lightworkers","id":37878},{"urlkey":"environmentalism","name":"Environmentalism","id":37896}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Project-Prema\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Prema is the Sanskrit word for divine or unconditional love.

I created this New Jersey group for women ( mid 20's to mid 30's) to cultivate a similar experience.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive.

One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks.

We don't have the luxury of wide open fields with no one around to bother. I am a member of a local aviation club, but it can take up an hour or longer each way to get there and it just isn't always practical. I like to fly small to larger airplanes as well. I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions. I have a whole series of future events and plans that I am working on but this is a simple start.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176296482,"name":"Daso"},"members":22,"name":"New York Radio Control Airplanes Meetup","id":18842509,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Radio-Control-Airplanes-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Flyers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439841130000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"flash-mobs","name":"Flash Mobs","id":25168},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"anything-and-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-do","name":"Anything and everything you've ever wanted to do.","id":56684},{"urlkey":"random-fun","name":"Random Fun","id":100994},{"urlkey":"a-little-bit-of-everything","name":"A little bit of everything","id":125692},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-adventure","name":"Spontaneous Adventure","id":169461},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-meetups","name":"Spontaneous Meetups","id":607482},{"urlkey":"any-spontaneous-fun-suggestions","name":"Any spontaneous fun suggestions!","id":1028392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Spontaneous-People\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is an experimental Meetup group for those of us who do things a bit more impromptu: we might wake up on a Saturday morning and decide to go rock climbing or hiking; or we thought we were going to have a mellow weekend but get a little restless.

I AM native to the high desert of central Mexico, of Toltec ancestry, born in the land of the Chichimeca. I recently relocated to New York from Los Angeles, CA. and I look forward to contributing sound vibration therapy as a healing art modality. I offer to guide my fellow sound alchemists into a beautiful dream through which we will all reach a zero point state of being. My intention for NY Sound Alchemy is to create a comfortable, invigorating, magical, mysterious, and healing \"sound-bath\/sound-scape\" for my guests. I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage & Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal & Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

There is a $3 meetup fee that will be collected offline at the end of the meetup when the bill arrives. It will be used to offset the meetup organizational costs ($180 per year for running a group).

We could also just meet in a beautiful place like the Cloisters, Governor's Island, Lyndhurst's Rose Garden or Untermeyer Park for a picnic, enjoy a sunset in a dramatic landscape, or watch an outdoor movie. In winter or rainy weather we could visit a wing of the MET or explore the art in the metro, or even just meet for a drink in a speakeasy bar. Any activity can be an \u00ab&nbsp;excuse&nbsp;\u00bb to practice your French in a non-formal setting. The idea is to practice conversation with diversified topics\/environments and currents events, popular culture, politics, economics, news, etc. We can also discuss French literature and newspaper\/magazine articles and editorials.

NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals! Let's travel together and not be conformed to this world BUT see the beautiful world God has created!!! There's so much out there to see and I've only touched 9% of the countries in this world.

NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) is a model of excellence, communication and change. Whether you are interested in being more successful in your endeavors, enhance your communication skills or want to feel better in general, there's something for everyone here. There will be a brief intro to NLP, as well as opportunity to ask questions and learn more about NLP. We will also break into groups and work in pairs on specific goals and issues.

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws. Forge new friendships and get support based on healthy living. &nbsp;The program is free to users except for the shared cost of the meal, about $15\/meeting.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/highres_444762109.jpeg","photo_id":444762109,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/600_444762109.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/thumb_444762109.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8033889,"name":"Michael Rickicki","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/highres_7711566.jpeg","photo_id":7711566,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/member_7711566.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/thumb_7711566.jpeg"}},"members":143,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","id":18957225,"state":"NY","urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"East Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442936166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"nature-walks","name":"Nature Walks","id":19666},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/All-Women-Adventure-Travel-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for people who want to bond through international travel.
