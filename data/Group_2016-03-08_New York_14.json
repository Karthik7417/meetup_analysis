I didn't really see any kind of group like this on Meetup, so I thought it'd be cool to have a slightly different video game based group on here!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So this group is exactly what the title might suggest. Our meetups are centered around the great conversations we can have from talking about the games we've been playing as a group! This is meant to be a relaxing, casual get-together where you can meet new people, share a common interest with new friends, and maybe even learn some new things about your favorite game(s)! We encourage that everyone try and play the games we'll be talking about for yourselves but it's okay if you can't either. You might learn about their experiences in ways that you never would have gotten playing it yourself anyway. And we'll be trying to have meetups that can revolve around everyone playing something at the same time as well to spread events around the month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do ask that everyone signing up for the group have a clear picture of themselves on their profile so that we can recognize members for each meetup. I'll be taking suggestions from the sign-up questions on what our games for each month are going to be, and we'll go from there. Other than that, all we ask is that you're ready to have a good time and talk about games with new friends!

Anyone who joins LCM can expect fun and fellowship, as well as growth, sound doctrine, and more importantly a life changing experience with the support and guidance of other brothers and sisters, who demonstrate that Christianity does not consist of a bunch of boring religious practices, but that it can be fun and fulfilling as well.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197547067,"name":"Crispin Jackson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/4\/highres_252517860.jpeg","photo_id":252517860,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/4\/member_252517860.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/4\/thumb_252517860.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"Lighthouse Christian Fellowship","id":19265617,"state":"NY","urlname":"Lighthouse-Christian-Ministries","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Fellowshipers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Rego Park","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451780148000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blogs","name":"Blogging","id":44508},{"urlkey":"writing-for-blogs","name":"Writing for Blogs","id":119157},{"urlkey":"food-blogging","name":"Food Blogging","id":122825},{"urlkey":"wordpress-for-blogging","name":"WordPress for Blogging","id":772742},{"urlkey":"blogging-for-profit-fun","name":"Blogging for Profit & Fun","id":1126822}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Local-Voices-The-Queens-Blogger-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>All bloggers, regardless of skill level or number of followers, are welcome to join.

What do we mean by meaningful? Bringing people together for a defined purpose that aims to help you. Our events and activities focus on the art of connecting, rather than networking. (Quality over quantity). After all, establishing connections and building relationships shouldn't be about sales pitches or propositions, rather, what did you actually learn from the other person and how can you help them as well.<\/p>\n<p>We will offer a variety of events throughout the year that primarily focus on the problems startups and entrepreneurs face.

Once the next event is scheduled, I will be sending you an email with an advance sign up link and hope you will come out to continue to support this great cause!&nbsp; If you have any requests for studios\/gyms to try, please let me know. <\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192579335,"name":"Samantha Cornell","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/5\/6\/highres_252676982.jpeg","photo_id":252676982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/5\/6\/member_252676982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_252676982.jpeg"}},"members":29,"name":"Raising the Bar: A Fitness and Networking Event for Lawyers","id":19296588,"state":"NY","urlname":"Raising-the-Bar-A-Fitness-and-Networking-Event-for-Lawyers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Fit Professionals"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Queens Village","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452192025000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"tennis","name":"Tennis","id":2926},{"urlkey":"outdoor-tennis","name":"Outdoor Tennis","id":19954},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"tennis-for-beginners","name":"Tennis for Beginners","id":26757},{"urlkey":"tennis-lessons","name":"tennis lessons","id":45786},{"urlkey":"competitive-tennis","name":"Competitive Tennis","id":50954},{"urlkey":"indoor-tennis","name":"Indoor Tennis","id":112625},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"pick-up-tennis","name":"Pick-up Tennis","id":158684}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Alley-Pond-Tennis-Center\/","rating":5,"description":"Want to meet nice, friendly people who love tennis come check out all the different events hosted at Alley Pond.

Thank you for becoming a member of this group.&nbsp; This should be a fun adventure.&nbsp; I am going to be a Dungoen Master for this group.&nbsp; I have spent many years as a mathematician and computer scientist specializing in Japanese and Indian&nbsp;mathematics.&nbsp; I have also spent many years teaching&nbsp;religion in classes in Manhattan, New York and online through distance learning programs.&nbsp; I have taught classes and given lectures on Norse Mythology, Polynesian Religion, East Asian Religion, and other religious and historical topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am also a Kung Fu instructor in Manhattan's China Town and Manhattan's Korea Town.&nbsp; I use my knowledge of religion, history, and mathematics in the campaigns that I&nbsp;produce and&nbsp;run.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;very intelligent and unique perspectives towards role playing and have studied role playing games for over 20 years!&nbsp; Please join me in the adventure of role playing games, CCGs, and table top games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p><strong> <br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The CCGs, RPGs, and Wargames!<\/strong>&nbsp;

Typically campaigns are going to run until all of the player characters have either died or have finished the campaign objectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flash Sessions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(Only 10 active registrations allowed per flash session!)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are ideal for beginner players.&nbsp; These are RPGs, CCGs, or Table Top sessions that are going to be completed the same day that they begin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tournaments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(Only 30 active registrations allowed per tournament!)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tournaments are going to be Campaigns and Sessions where players are ranked and a prize is going to be given to the winning players.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>The current registration cost for Campaigns, Flash Sessions, and Tournaments&nbsp;is free.&nbsp; You need to register any character, deck,&nbsp;or army with an official Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top Dungeon Master though.&nbsp; All characters need to be&nbsp;produced and rolled in front of an official group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; All decks need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All armies need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; This is to ensure that characters and stats are not&nbsp;altered and that characters are&nbsp;using their actual rolled stats and not illegally inflated stats.&nbsp; <strong><em>When the group has more members than space to play, there is going to be a cost of $10.00 a character, $10.00 a deck,&nbsp;and $15.00 an army for registration.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; Every group member gets to register 3 characters and&nbsp;1 army for free.&nbsp; You do not have to pay for sessions as long as you are using a registered character, or army, that has not died.&nbsp; Characters can not be reused or reregistered after they die.&nbsp; Armies and decks can be reused, but need to be reregistered and renamed, after they are defeated in battle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Usually, we are going to give at least 3 months notice prior to beginning any campaign.&nbsp; You need to register for the campaign via meetup. If you are absent from a session during a campaign, you either are given a loss for that battle, or your character is said to be in a limbo and remains in place until you return.&nbsp; If you do not return for 3 Meetups in&nbsp;a row, your character dies.&nbsp; You are not allowed to reuse a dead character.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>REGISTRION COST:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Characters:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE&nbsp; (There is currently no cost for registering&nbsp;Characters with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Armies:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Armies&nbsp;with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decks:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Decks with this group.)<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Thank you,<\/p>\n<p>Erik<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/highres_445811825.jpeg","photo_id":445811825,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/600_445811825.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/thumb_445811825.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197771903,"name":"Erik","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/highres_252697901.jpeg","photo_id":252697901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/member_252697901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/thumb_252697901.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"The Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top group!","id":19296737,"state":"NY","urlname":"rpgclub","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452192657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"new-in-town-women-only","name":"New in Town: Women Only","id":74490},{"urlkey":"new-in-town-social","name":"New In Town: Social","id":78498}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-to-New-York-time-to-connect-with-great-women\/","rating":0,"description":"I'm new to New York City and am eager to meet some wonderful women who want to explore Manhattan, etc with like women.

I\u2019ve always had fairly good self-esteem and confidence about my body and myself- and wanted the same for others. Of course we\u2019re not going to feel great about ourselves 24\/7, but I want to help more people feel happy, healthy, to love and accept themselves, and to realize how incredible they are. For a long time, I had a narrow view of what it meant to have positive body image- mostly dictated by what society said we should judge ourselves by: a specific beauty ideal, weight, what people thought, and by what we were eating. Throughout my personal evolution, I have learned to grow exponentially stronger in the love for my body and discovered this emerging body positive culture. What initially ignited my fire and determination to add to this important conversation about positive body image is the many women I started to meet post high school struggling with serious body image issues, and although I have not personally suffered, their experiences touched me greatly. What matters to me, and what I want to spread throughout my life- be it with the weights classes, Zumba classes, BollyX classes I teach or Meetups I run- is the importance of inner health -to prevent against disease etc- and that our weight and appearance does not determine our beauty nor worth. I'm clear that loving ourselves and our bodies is the best path to take- not negative self-talk or hate. I want to create a community where women can come and talk about a healthy body image and see themselves in a positive, loving light. Join me and let's talk about what it means for you!

Women all over the world are waking up to a new renaissance of the heart, soul and body, reclaiming her inner voice and taking steps towards freedom.<\/p>\n<p>For the last five years I have been repairing my relationship with my&nbsp;mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies.&nbsp;I overcame breast cancer and had to take a really hard look at all the emotional&nbsp;toxins and mindsetI was carrying around from my relationship with my parents and then men, I was acting out subconsciously, seeking love from a pain point. My wounds were speaking louder than my heart, they began to show me how unhappy I was. Fast forward five years to today. Today I travel and teach throughout North America sharing with women Soul Therapy Seminars and a Journey to Self Love, a two day emotionally empowering discovery of learning how to love yourself, honestly, courageously and with joy. I know you have been yearning to share with a group of women who have your back, seeking support from others who can understand your own journey, acknowledging your pain while uplifting you to greater new heights of self awareness. You've been ready for a long time now, searching and seeking your own journey to self love. I've been there, let me help guide you along the way so that you can get there with the support that you need to accelerate your life to one of freedom and inner peace. I am grateful to be able to share with you all that I have learned on my own journey to self love!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join me&nbsp;in&nbsp;this powerful group of women as we&nbsp;explore&nbsp;self love, while learning how to connect deeply to your authentic self, the part of you that is desiring to live a powerfully expressed life. There is that small voice that wants to be heard, understood, acknowledged and loved, that part is your authentic self: your soul.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Goldfarb, Licensed Soul Therapist, Spiritual Healer &amp; Guide<\/p>\n<p><b><span>Testimonials:<\/span> <\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I had the pleasure of taking Carolyn's \"A Journey To Self Love\" group class and it was amazing! She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. <b>- Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me.<b>-<\/b><b>Alexandra B., NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>*** <\/b>If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before.

Not only sharing ideas and strategies to grow your business, but also to have a place to go when things don\u2019t go as expected and you need a little inspiration or cheering up!<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I created my VIP Facebook Group, because nothing compares to real-time support and live discussions with entrepreneurs who have been in your shoes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And you can join now:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/MarketingforFashionistas\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/MarketingforFashionistas\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, for the lucky ones who live in NY, I decided to create a Monthly Meetup since nothing compares the face to face interaction!!!<\/p>\n<p>My Meetups won't be just to make connections (which I know how important it is to your success) but also a bit of Training!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, FREE Training from moi! Each month we'll meet&nbsp;to talk about a specific topic that will help you move closer to your Dream Fashion Biz!

His novel The Radetzky March, which appeared two years later, is almost universally recognized as a classic. Yet Roth\u2019s earlier work, in which he probingly examined the upheavals of his time\u2014particularly the Russian revolution\u2014have only recently been rediscovered. In the United States, a new anthology of his early reportage, The Hotel Years, has just been published by New Directions, and in Germany his newly published essays on Russia have been celebrated by critics and readers alike. Are we experiencing an international Roth Renaissance? Jan B\u00fcrger and George Prochnik will discuss one of the most important and enigmatic writers of the modern era, and provide insights into his astonishing body of work with the aid of manuscripts and letters from the Leo Baeck Institute, New York, and the German Literature Archive, Marbach. Jan B\u00fcrger is a literary scholar and author. He wrote his dissertation about Hans Henny Jahnn, belongs to the founding editors of the Berlin journal Literaturen, and has worked since 2002 at the German Literature Archive. In addition to numerous contributions to journals and newspapers (including Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he has written Der gestrandete Wal: Das ma\u00dflose Leben des Hans Henny Jahnn (2003), Benns Doppelleben oder wie man sich selbst zusammensetzt (2006), Max Frisch: Das Tagebuch (2011) and Der Neckar: Eine literarische Reise (2013). He is also the editor of a number of events including Ich bin nicht innerlich. Ann\u00e4herungen an Gottfried Benn (2003), Friedrich Schiller: Dichter, Denker, Vor- und Gegenbild (2007), Liebe ist Quatsch. Briefe an Ellinor by Hans Henny Jahnn (with Sandra Hiemer, 2014) Briefwechsel by Alfred Andersch and Max Frisch (2014), as well as Reisen in die Ukraine und nach Russland by Joseph Roth (2015).

Most importantly, do you want to become more happy and satisfied? If you answered yes to any of those questions, MBTI Enthusiasts is for you! Through MBTI Personality Types we will learn more about ourselves and understand our differences with other people. I created this group to bring together people who have an interest in the Myers Briggs Type Indicator in an informal\/relaxed environment where we can learn from each other through interactive activities and intellectual discussions about 16 types. Whether you are expert or dummy in MBTI Personality Types, we welcome you! This is the place to be if you'd like to socialize with people who share an awareness of the importance of personality. We encourage to hold space for each other to learn about and understand our differences. Come to join us to make some new friends and have a good time! 16 types are: INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ENFJ, INTP, ENTP, INTJ, ENTJ, ISFJ, ESFJ, ISFP, ESFP, ISTP, ESTP, ISTJ, ESTJ.

You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how to acquire that state of mind which will attract riches.

She performed Saint-Sa\u00ebns' second concerto with Saint-Sa\u00ebns conducting the orchestra, at age 15 in 1907. That same year, though, she fractured her wrist in a bike accident. Because it was improperly set, she had to give up her budding career as a solo concert pianist and turned to teaching, setting up her first school in Switzerland.&nbsp;<\/span><span>It was Sergey Rachmaninov who advocated to the US State Department that she be allowed to emigrate to the US to bring solfege to this country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Through Claude Debussy, the lineage of musicality continues up through Franz Liszt, Carl Czerny, and Ludwig van Beethoven (you can Google this in the Wikipedia pages). So former students of Mlle. Combe and her students (including Stephen Waters and more) are musical descendants of these famous composers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was Mlle. Combe's piano student from 1972 - 1982 and performed at Carnegie Recital Hall nine times as a child. My little sister performed there ten times, and many of my classmates did as well. Alumni during the 1970's who went professional musically have worked with Zubin Mehta and Constance Keene, studied at Juilliard (six classmates that I know of including myself) and other conservatories (five that I know of), and become worldwide concertizing artists, professors at conservatories, resident composers and artists. One alumna after my time is now a professional singer who has sung in many famous movies.<\/p>\n<p>Those alumni during my time who did not become professional musicians became doctors, lawyers, technologists (like myself), entrepreneurs, executives, educators, etc. Some crossed over, becoming professional performers and entrepreneurs \/ technologists. It turns out we didn't just learn about music. We learned about discipline, self-control, attention to detail, perseverance, standards of excellence, and how to pick ourselves up and continue on when we ran into challenges. These are universally valuable skills that affect every aspect of one's life - personally and professionally.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds intimidating, doesn't it? Here's the thing: were we a bunch of freaky Mozart genius kids?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Oh heck no.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What happened was that we were given wildly efficient and effective piano practice methods, solfege lessons to develop our understanding of music, and insights from a teacher who knew exactly what the French composers intended with their compositions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who are part of the French School of Music family were given an extraordinary opportunity, and we fully intend to pass along what we learned from Mlle. Combe. Our mission is to ensure that future generations of music students have the same opportunity that we had, including adding their names to an amazing musical lineage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all who are passionate about music, who want to learn better piano practice techniques, and learn how solfege can help you build a solid musical foundation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>- Eileen Chang Sauer<\/p>\n<p>French School of Music <br>210 W 8th Street <br>Plainfield, NJ&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>(908) 757-3087<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>info@frenchschoolofmusic.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.frenchschoolofmusic.com\">French School website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/French-School-of-Music-710622825625877\/\">French School Facebook page<\/a>, which includes historical artifacts and photos from French School, recordings of recitals, as well as video of Carnegie Recital Hall performances and trophy ceremonies in the 1970's.<\/p>\n<p>My dad's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianopractice.org\">piano practice book<\/a>, capturing Mlle.

You should be able to speak and understand at least a little Chinese or you won't be able to participate the conversation. In this Meetup, every week I choose a different topic as a starting point for our conversation. I will post the topic on each Meetup page at least one day before the Meetup. If there is more than one meeting in a week, it will be the same topic, you can try once again or attend next week for the new topic. I will use part of textbooks or media videos to help discuss. RSVP required. RSVP closed the day before every meetup. Min. 2 people, max. 10 people per Meetup (+ me). RSVPs are final: RSVP only if you can come. If something comes up and you can't make it please change your RSVP to \"no\" so I know who is coming. All meeting will be around Middle East Manhattan. But if you recommend some nice places as well, please do tell me. ---- What's more, there are 3 kinds of Chinese classes that I can offer: -Business: focus on the field that you work in. -Travelling: training of the communication of daily life. -Specialize\/Academic Conference: shortly translation, speech training,etc. For private lessons please contact me personally.

This sense of trust not only manifests within the practice, but also permeates throughout the rest of our lives. This kind of attention to the body changes the way we habitually think and react. It encourages us to develop the skills of deep listening, witnessing, and compassion with our inner selves as well as with others. The beauty of this practice is that it can be practiced by anyone with a willingness to show up and be present.

Welcome the word\u2019s first drinking club dedicated to bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats. Ideally, this Meetup aims to foster meaningful political discussions\u2014and hopefully camaraderie\u2014between people with opposing viewpoints. At the very least, it hopes to bring together people who share an interest in American politics. In order for this Meetup to be successful, we must keep these goals in mind:<\/p>\n<p>1. In order to generate interesting discussions, we need a mix of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Preaching to the choir is not as fun\u2014or as constructive\u2014as debating issues. Consequently, since New York City is majority-Democrat, reaching out to non-liberals is a priority.<\/p>\n<p>2. We need good topics to discuss at every Meetup. Topics can be specific or general. Possible topics include: privately-funded healthcare vs. publically-funded healthcare, interventionism vs. isolationism, conservatism vs. mainstream republicanism, Bernie vs. Hillary, Trump vs. the establishment, pragmatism vs. idealism, deportation vs. path to citizenship, flat tax vs. graduated tax, security vs. privacy, mental health reform vs. gun control, voter fraud vs. voter suppression, gerrymandering, student loans, the death penalty, women in combat, the pay gap, drug policy, welfare, the minimum wage, labor unions, education policy, terrorism, Israel, Iran, Syria\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3. We need to be able to respectfully discuss our differences. We\u2019ll see whether alcohol helps or hinders achievement of this goal.<\/p>\n<p>4. We need to not ONLY talk about politics. We also want to get to know each other and make new friends. Alcohol will definitely prove helpful in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>5. We need to welcome people of various knowledge levels.

The Church is living in our cities...\" Those were the words of Pope Francis in his homily at Madison Square Garden last September. It is in that spirit that I am starting this meetup group during this the Extraordinary Jubilee, or Holy Year of Mercy.<\/p>\n<p>This group will have a simple mission: To visit and attend Mass at the various Catholic churches in the city of New York, then get together for fellowship at a local pub afterwards. That's it. No speed dating, speaker series, Bible study, joint socials with non-Catholic groups, or anything else. There are other Catholic groups that have those things covered. But unlike those groups, this group will not be tied to any particular parishes. We will get to experience Mass in as many Catholic churches as we can, as many different neighborhoods as we can, even as the number of Catholic churches in New York dwindles. Many of these churches have amazing stories to tell down through the generations.<\/p>\n<p>This is neither a liberal nor conservative Catholic group so please keep politics out of it. I'm most interested in meeting my fellow Catholic single young and not-so-young-anymore (20s, 30s, 40s) adults, but all ages are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the words of Pope Francis in mind: \"...big cities are a reminder of the hidden riches present in our world: in the diversity of its cultures, traditions and historical experiences. In the variety of its languages, costumes and cuisine. Big cities bring together all the different ways which we human beings have discovered to express the meaning of life, wherever we may be.\" <\/p>\n<p>If you'd like to celebrate being Catholic in the big city, this group is for you.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/1\/c\/highres_446805084.jpeg","photo_id":446805084,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/1\/c\/600_446805084.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/1\/c\/thumb_446805084.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":712660,"name":"Dennis","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/7\/d\/highres_4301341.jpeg","photo_id":4301341,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/7\/d\/member_4301341.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/7\/d\/thumb_4301341.jpeg"}},"members":46,"name":"New York Church and a Pub","id":19420246,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Church-and-a-Pub","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"New York City Catholics"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Forest Hills","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453572310000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"academy-awards","name":"Academy Awards","id":55373},{"urlkey":"oscar-party","name":"Oscar Party","id":643512}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Movie-Night-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This started as a meetup for young Oscar enthusiasts Ages (19-30) to come join an Oscar party in my house.

With this method we can \u201cdiagnose\u201d and make visible the patterns and blockages which have followed us from the past. The most healing approach to those traumas is not to run away and to forget, but to bring them out. Like the vampire that disintegrates into dust when brought out to the sun \u2013 the traumatic story, when brought out to the conscious level, stops programming our behavior and becomes a valuable experience and knowledge. This practice will give you a chance to work on your personal problems and to serve as a helper in other people\u2019s constellations. The experience of participating in somebody else's constellation gives you deep knowledge of the family relationship structure. This practice brings valuable wisdom to the participant, opens their heart and vision. The Family Constellation method effectively addresses: \u2022 relationship problems \u2022 career issues \u2022 business and financial difficulties \u2022 bodily pain and illness \u2022 depression \u2022 habitual emotional and behavioral patterns When we experience depression, emotional instability, problems with our relationship or career, a common practice is to search for an answer within the realm of our own views and personal history. However, in some cases these issues arise not from personal history, but from our ancestral memories - from the traumas which happened several generations before us. We perceive such traumas as an atmosphere of pressure, danger or threat which affects our feelings and actions. A person with a traumatized \u201cfamily field\u201d intuitively feels that his\/her family energy is too \u201cheavy\u201d and rejects it, putting a barrier between them and their family energy. In a case like this the negative energies are partially blocked, but the power of the family and ancestors\u2019 blessings are blocked as well. In order to move forward you need to feel safety at your back. It is not easy to understand and heal wounds which came from the past. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what happened generations ago. If we do know some stories we feel they are not too important \u2013 we see them as grandmother\u2019s tales of the far past. Those traumas manifest as a tense and heavy atmosphere in our relationships with parents, spouses or kids. They can also manifest as repeated patterns of events in our life.

Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head.

We are love, we are grace, we are one with everything in creation. Please come and celebrate who you are in a community of loving, light -filled beautiful souls. When we gather together to share in oneness, each of us is raised and anchored into our awareness of unity consciousness and the unconditional love that informs all of creation.

It's a conversation.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. \"Can I say anything I want?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Absolutely. You can even curse like a sailor if you want to.<\/p>\n<p><b>6. \"I don't know if I'm interesting enough.\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Not true. Everyone has lived through a few amazing life experiences.

If you're coming on m\u00fcrmur with the purpose of promoting, then you're missing the whole point!&nbsp; <br>For instance, I realize that if you're a musician, it's very likely that we will stumble upon the topic of music at some point during our talk.

Your work day is 12 hours with commuting. You sleep maybe 6 hours a night. The rest of the time is taking care of the kids, spouse, dog, cat, partner, laundry, shopping, cleaning and a few other errands that you've been putting off for weeks. How do you fit one hour of exercise a day into that schedule? You don't. That's why a few pounds accumulate each year right after the holidays that you can't seem to get off before summer. This group is about 15 minute workouts that get results (indoors and out). Nutrition tips that you can actually do. Work smarter and more efficiently without spinning your wheels.

This work is based on the simple physics of vulnerability: If we are brave enough, often enough, we will fall. What does that mean? We all have a story about an experience; a situation, a conversation that made us feel bad, sad, hurt, and ashamed. It can be a story of personal heartbreak, a story from our childhood, a relationship and\/or a professional struggle. It's the story where we think we are not good enough; smart enough, thin enough, or even not worthy of being loved. That we\u2019re a bad friend, parent, spouse, boss, son, or daughter. When we don't resolve these feelings, they stop us from having courage in our day-to-day lives. Who should take this workshop? This work is for anyone that wants to: - Explore a story of struggle - Get curious about the emotions that keep us stuck in our story - Learn how owning our story of struggle gives us the power to write a brave new ending How does Rising Strong work? The work is broken down into three acts and is facilitated through discussion, video and written exercises. Act I: The Reckoning \u2013 We Walk Into Our Story. Act II: The Rumble \u2013 Owning Our Story. Act III: The Revolution \u2013 Process Becomes Practice. We write a new ending to our story based on our key learnings and use this new, braver story to change how we engage with the world and to ultimately transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":106571132,"name":"Susan G.

It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.&nbsp; <br> <br>Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity&nbsp; <br> <br><b>What is Sahaja Meditation?&nbsp;<\/b> <br> <br>How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.&nbsp; <br> <br>How does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.&nbsp; <br> <br>Once awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Overview.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.&nbsp; <br> <br>If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.&nbsp; <br> <br>Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.&nbsp; <br> <br>There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>The power of collective meditation<\/b>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12422128,"name":"Alan Wherry","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/highres_253437724.jpeg","photo_id":253437724,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/member_253437724.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/thumb_253437724.jpeg"}},"members":52,"name":"Meditation Classes, Kingsbridge NYPL, Bronx - Always Free","id":19471790,"state":"NY","urlname":"Meditation-Kingsbridge-Library-Bronx-Always-Free","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454218552000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"black-entrepreneurs","name":"Black Entrepreneurs","id":16348},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Minority-Women-Owned-Biz-M-WBE-Diversity-Tech-Careers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Thank you for your interest in this new community of minority, women, and other diversity group members who are either currently or seeking to become a \u201d government certified (M\/WBE) business enterprise, and\/ or simply desiring to explore other methodologies of business capitalization, growth, utilizing tech and new media to develop new business and career opportunities.

Meditation has been proven to be the cause of great healing and balance for the mind, body and soul. My Chakra balancing meditation is excellent for the experienced practitioner or the beginner. Toning the sacred sounds for each chakra, we are sending energy in and out of each chakra to remove any blockages, trauma and negative energy. Toning provides the body relaxation through vibration of the sounds, allowing one to achieve stillness and balance. For the first timer who has tried meditation but has not been successful at quieting the mind, this practice enables one to achieve success.

Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 40-50 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Let's help each other to make space and time to create the life we want to live by decluttering, curating, and editing your life to a life that you would be proud of. (Plus , a life that is more sustainable &amp; environmentally friendly via minimalism) This group is for support, inspiration, and motivation!<\/p>\n<p>Here people who deal with issues such as minimalist lifestyle, sustainability and reduced consumption meet. The 5 Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle are an important part of the way of thinking in everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup group in New York City will host meetings in all 5 boroughs for everyone who wants to discover, learn more or share their experiences with minimalism. Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what adds value to their lives. By clearing the clutter from life's path, we can all make room for the most important aspects of life: health, relationships, passion, growth, and contribution. There are many flavors of minimalism: a twenty-year-old single guy's minimalist lifestyle looks different from a forty-five-year-old mother's minimalist life. Even though everyone embraces minimalism differently, each path leads to the same place: a more purposeful and deliberate life.<\/p>\n<p>If this speaks to you, join in the upcoming conversations!

Are you up to accept others responses whether it's a head shake from side to side or hearing, \" are you kidding?\" or a laugh aloud, or I don't get it?

Join me in creating a humor honing zone, for many self evolving evenings, and with any spur of the moment topic as fodder. We're being brave and honing our humor zone. One gem may nail it, the next falls flat. This is the arena for getting comfortable with exploring your own personal brand of humor in all moments among like minded crazies. This makes this meetup evening our thing. No masters, or lessons, or humor guidelines, no physical humor, no abusive humor. Our goal isn't to to be comedians, or standsups. Let's meet and chat about everything and find our humor rather than criticism, frowns, sad sighs, pursed lips, defensive or offensive tackles, fears and anger and controlling egos.<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185959426,"name":"Michelle Babian","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/5\/d\/highres_248244669.jpeg","photo_id":248244669,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/5\/d\/member_248244669.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/5\/d\/thumb_248244669.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Honing Honest Humor","id":19535832,"state":"NY","urlname":"Honing-Honest-Humor","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"humor honers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454942466000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"publicrelations","name":"Public Relations","id":1579},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"corporate-communications","name":"Corporate Communications","id":15708},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"live-video-broadcasts-webinars-webcasts","name":"Live Video Broadcasts (Webinars\/Webcasts)","id":23395},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"digital-public-relations","name":"Digital Public Relations","id":34485},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"vlogging","name":"vlogging","id":58515},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-professionals","name":"Digital Marketing Professionals","id":100736},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"digital-media-and-social-marketing","name":"Digital Media and Social Marketing","id":258442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Art-of-Smartphone-Filmmaking-New-York-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In your hand right now you have the ultimate tool to create compelling, relevant, high quality video...its your smartphone.

I started this group to inspire other live streamers around the world to meet in person, accelerate business relationships, share best practices with each other, and grow the global community of live streamers.  \n\nIt is also important for us to meet in person to build closer business relationships, make connections, and help the global community develop and adopt best practices to limit or help eliminate negative experiences in the global live streaming video world, such as spam, trolls, fraud and other socially unacceptable and\/or criminal behavior.\n\nOne of the best ways to differentiate yourself in business is through public speaking and broadcasting including Blab.im, Periscope, Facebook Livestream, MeVee, Meerkat, GoLiveWith and Snapchat, as well as new and emerging platforms.  \n\nAll levels of public speaking and live streaming video are welcome! You can expect to network with other businesses, speakers and social media enthusiasts while learning new tricks and tips of the trade.
