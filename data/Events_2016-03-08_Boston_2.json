We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

To do this, we provide financing and mentoring to early-stage life-science companies so that they can obtain further funding, reach positive cash-flows or get acquired. MA2 members are carefully vetted for their deep expertise around the health sciences. Many of them have been researchers, clinicians, venture capitalists, executives, consultants, engineers, bankers or attorneys. They bring a willingness to support early stage companies to further our mission. In addition, we draw on our deep relationships with the institutions in Boston healthcare supercluster, the leading healthcare innovation center in the world. They provide additional resources, including deal flow, expertise and advisors for the companies we work with.<br\/>MA2 provides early stage funding to companies looking to raise between $250K to $3MM. Depending on the size of the investment, MA2 is willing to provide all or part of a round. We are willing to work closely with other angel groups or venture funds to ensure that the round is closed and a company adequately capitalized. We are looking for companies that are extremely capital efficient and where our funds will lead to significant step-ups in valuation (in part to avoid unfavorable future funding rounds). Our target is a 5x return within 5 years.<br\/>We invest in medical devices, therapeutics, diagnostics, health services, health information technologies, and relevant research-related tools including laboratory equipment.<\/p> <p><b>Richard Anders<\/b> Mass Medical Angels' Participating Representative:<\/p> <p>Richard Anders, J.D. | Founder, Executive Director, Mass Medical Angels<br\/>Richard Anders is is an investor and long-time entrepreneur.

So when Microsoft needed the brightest minds to work on tomorrow\u2019s technologies, Boston was the natural choice. And we love our New England home. The people. The ideas. The history. The culture.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

In fact, the program is relentlessly aimed at increasing the firepower of current US nuclear forces. These activities have not been missed by Russian military analysts and their political leaders, who have interpreted these unremitting activities as US preparations to fight and win a nuclear war with Russia.<\/p> <p>At the same time, political tensions between the US and Russia are rising and threaten to get more dangerous. There are also very serious shortfalls in Russia\u2019s early warning system, and in the morale of US personnel who man US nuclear forces. These circumstances have almost certainly led Russian political leaders to streamline decision-making so Russian nuclear forces could be launched in the event of an American nuclear attack against Russia.<\/p> <p>These circumstances greatly increased the danger of a world nuclear catastrophe. The status of the current situation will be discussed in this talk, as well as the global consequences of such an event.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Effective-Altruism\/events\/229097550\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Talk on risk of nuclear war","id":"229097550","time":1456434000000,"updated":1456446688000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1353769946000,"name":"Boston Effective Altruism","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":5974392,"urlname":"Boston-Effective-Altruism","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Effective Altruists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"101 Arch Street","name":"Pret A Manger","lon":-71.05925,"id":24164822,"state":"MA","lat":42.355026,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.648575305939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454813364000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-First-Time-Pregnancy-New-Mom-Meetup\/events\/228673438\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Coffee & Conversation!","id":"flgfqlyvdbhc","time":1456439400000,"updated":1456451684000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449857245000,"name":"Boston First-Time Pregnancy & New Mom Meetup","group_lon":-71.0299987793,"id":19203583,"urlname":"Boston-First-Time-Pregnancy-New-Mom-Meetup","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Moms-to-be & Moms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"333 Summer Street","name":"LogMeIn","lon":-71.048347,"id":24347493,"state":"MA","lat":42.349037,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.3428388834,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454600925000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Greetings fellow Boston Node.JS enthusiasts! \u00a0Our next meetup is in three weeks and we will be hosting it across the street from our usual location in LogMeIn's NEW office at 333 Summer Street. \u00a0The new meeting space is awesome (we should have less issues with obstructing poles); it should be great for this kind of event.<\/p> <p>As usual, Xively will be sponsoring and will have plenty of food, beer, and wine on hand. \u00a0I hope to see you all there!<\/p> <p>- \u00a0Brian<\/p> <p>---------------<\/p> <p><b>Jonathan Kaufman - Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Dismantling the Monolith: Building and Discovering Microservices in Node.js<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Microservices seem to be all that anyone is talking about these days; long gone is the monolithic app. The idea is simple - take one large app and break it into a bunch of tinier apps that interact in a reliable and fault-tolerant way. This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to overcome - how do these \"tiny apps\" communicate? How do they discover each other? How big is too big?

This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to overcome - how do these \"tiny apps\" communicate? How do they discover each other? How big is too big? In this talk, we will build a microservice-based architecture up from scratch, while discussing different design patterns and common pitfalls, all in Node.js.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Jonathan Kaufman is a Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology currently residing in Cambridge, MA. After getting a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, he worked on all things front-end for IBM Verse. When not blogging about why React is his favorite framework, or how to do build awesome apps with IBM Bluemix and Watson, he can be found working on the intersection between music and technology.<\/p> <p>Still haven't registered for your free Bluemix account?

The idea that servers weren\u2019t the commodity, but that the CPU and RAM they contained were the resources that mattered revolutionized how hardware was bought, how maintenance was performed and how application sizing was done.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, while this transformation was going on, storage steadfastly refused to get the memo. A lack of innovation, a clear desire to rely on old, limited architectures to protect margins and an ecosystem that didn\u2019t demand those things left us with a storage market full of legacy products, incapable of adapting to new technology or consumption models.<\/p> <p>With the advent of flash, however, both the flaws and some possible solutions to this situation have become clear. Flash-only, scale out architectures have begun appearing on the landscape, with the promise of doing to storage what the first wave of virtualization did to the server market. What are these new architectures? How are they changing how storage is managed? How are they changing how IT looks at and purchases the resources needed to support new and different workloads?<\/p> <p>Join Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Flash Architect from SolidFire, to discuss these topics and more, and take a look at how storage architecture might be able to change the industry.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/e\/3\/600_446742211.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:\u00a0Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Architect, Technology Solutions\u00a0<br\/>Jeramiah Dooley is a Principal Architect, focusing on VMware, OpenStack and SolidFire converged infrastructure solutions.

The idea that servers weren\u2019t the commodity, but that the CPU and RAM they contained were the resources that mattered revolutionized how hardware was bought, how maintenance was performed and how application sizing was done.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, while this transformation was going on, storage steadfastly refused to get the memo. A lack of innovation, a clear desire to rely on old, limited architectures to protect margins and an ecosystem that didn\u2019t demand those things left us with a storage market full of legacy products, incapable of adapting to new technology or consumption models.<\/p> <p>With the advent of flash, however, both the flaws and some possible solutions to this situation have become clear. Flash-only, scale out architectures have begun appearing on the landscape, with the promise of doing to storage what the first wave of virtualization did to the server market. What are these new architectures? How are they changing how storage is managed? How are they changing how IT looks at and purchases the resources needed to support new and different workloads?<\/p> <p>Join Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Flash Architect from SolidFire, to discuss these topics and more, and take a look at how storage architecture might be able to change the industry.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/e\/3\/600_446742211.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nSpeaker Bio:\u00a0Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Architect, Technology Solutions<br\/>Jeramiah Dooley is a Principal Architect, focusing on VMware, OpenStack and SolidFire converged infrastructure solutions.

How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

I wanted to let you know that due to a scheduling conflict we have to move MOPS to Friday the 26th. We will have our March meeting on Friday, March 11th, resuming the second Friday of the month. I apologize for this change but I'm very excited to see you all and hope you can make it out. We will have a great discussion, craft and a great time of fellowship. I really look forward to this meeting and I am so very grateful for each one of you! If you can RSVP your childcare by Monday, the 22nd that would be great. I want to say a big THANK YOU to all the MOPS moms from Hansom that hosted the play date today. Due to some crazy sickness, infections, and fevers in my house I wasn't able to go but I heard it was wonderful and such great time. Thank you to each one of you for your hospitality and thoughtfulness in planning this! I also want to let you know about a special Valentines Event we are hosting at our church. On Sunday Evening, February 14th we are having a Valentines Banquet. We have a special speaker coming in and we are having a delicious 3 course dinner. It will be a great time to snuggle up close to your spouse, enjoy good food, music, and a great message on marriage. If you were at the November MOPS meeting our special speaker was Audra Burbach. Her husband Brian, is the speaker for this banquet.<br\/>We would love to have some MOPS couples attend and it would be so nice to meet some of your husbands. If you would like more information email me and I would be happy to tell you more about it. Thanks so much for being such wonderful, supportive MOPS group. I so grateful to call you all friends!

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The Phenomenon And The Gift course\/retreat is happening in Boston and DC, Toronto and Orlando on Feb 27 and 28 with a pre-event on the 26th, it is hosted by Oneness Massachusetts and Oneness University of India<\/p> <p>200+ people have registered for Boston so far\u2014it will be AWESOME!<br\/>\u00a0\nSome of you have shared that you have some questions, which are addressed below. Also, check out comments\u00a0from\u00a0people\u00a0like us who participated in CA (below)<br\/>\u00a0\nYou still have time to register.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\nLove,<br\/>Marael<\/p> <p><b>1. I am not\u00a0familiar\u00a0with Oneness University. Who\u00a0is this seminar for?<\/b><br\/>This seminar is for everyone. It is for people from all walks of life: lawyers, business owners and professionals from very conservative backgrounds; spiritual people and non-spiritual people; people of all ages, backgrounds and approaches to life.<br\/>\u00a0\nIf you are concerned that it is too spiritual\u2014too woo-woo\u2013it isn't. It is a very grounded, practical program taught in a western approach, which is completely in alignment with how we think. The teachings are simple, powerful and deep.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\nPeople from all over the world attend courses at Oneness University for a better life. This course allows all who come to experience major shifts that transform their life in a gentle yet powerful way\u2014here at home. Whatever your path is, it will be strengthened.<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>2. What are the teachings?\u00a0Who will be giving them?<\/b><br\/>The teachings are simple, streamlined teachings\u2014practical, the nuts and bolts\u2014that are designed to help us raise our consciousness level. They will be delivered by story telling, exercises, reflection time and question and answer sessions.<br\/>\u00a0\nOneness Guides who are in very high states of consciousness themselves will give the teachings.\u00a0These guides have spent upwards of 20 years studying how to help people shift into higher states of consciousness. They have learned how to help us receive the transfers of grace necessary to enter into high states and then remain there. The guides are down-to-earth people, with a sense of humor and very high intelligence.<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>3. Sounds like it could be boring watching a screen all day. What will it be like?<\/b><br\/>It is so dynamic! Those who have attended report it\u2019s like you are transported to the Oneness University temple in India where people go into extremely high states of consciousness. You are transported in time and space. Energy and grace pours off the screen and bathes you all the time. It is such an interactive experience. You are interacting directly with the Guides\u2014you can see them and they can see you. As well, you will see all the people in Toronto, DC and Orlando.<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>4. What is \"The Gift\"?<\/b><br\/>People who come will experience a transformation in their life. It is totally dependent on what you want and what you ask for. This is \u201cyour\u201d gift. You also receive a direct transfer of Grace to help you. You can share this transfer of Grace to help others when you leave the seminar. In that sense, it is \u201ca gift that keeps on giving!\u201d<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>5. What do people who have participated say?<\/b><br\/><i>\u201cI was completely new to Oneness. This program has had a huge impact on me and my work. My artwork is flying off the shelf\u2014more wealth and prosperity is coming into my life. I was surprised how very practical and tangible the results have been.\u201d \u2014 Artist\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\n\u201cI used to resist things, avoid things or use a lot of effort to get things done. During the course a shift happened. \u00a0Now it is effortless. I am easily able to stay\u00a0present with what is. Miracles happen.\u00a0This is such a gift!\u201d \u2014 Mary<br\/>\u00a0\n\u201cThis course has helped me to feel safe!

With Marguerite Gance, Jean Debucourt, Charles Lamy<br\/>France 1928, 35mm, b\/w, 61 min<\/p> <p><b>Live Musical Accompaniment by Martin Marks<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Long considered a masterpiece of French impressionist cinema,\u00a0The Fall of the House of Usher\u2019s uncanny camera effects now seem closer in spirit to the symbolist poets than the impressionist painters. Drawing upon the full raft of avant-garde strategies prescribed in his theoretical writings, Epstein evokes the frenzy of artistic obsession, the transcendental force of nature, and the inherently subjective nature of appearances. Poe\u2019s motif of a painting so startlingly lifelike that it saps its real subject provides Epstein with an ideal vehicle for his ontological preoccupations with cinema itself. As Epstein would later reflect of the film\u2019s mesmerizing use of slow motion, \u201cThe actor can usually perform anything: he comes in, sits down, opens a book, flips through the pages; only the camera gives him a profound gravity, burdens him with an inexplicable secret and makes him a fragment of tragedy through the simple reduction of the temporal ratio of this performance.\u201d\u00a0Print courtesy Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.<\/p> <p>Preceded by<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/hcl.harvard.edu\/hfa\/images\/films\/2015decfeb\/epstein_three.jpg\" \/> The Three-Sided Mirror\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>(La glace \u00e0 trois faces)\u00a0<\/p> <p>Directed by Jean Epstein.

French intertitles with English subtitles<\/p> <p>With its strikingly modernist approach to film narrative,\u00a0The Three-Sided Mirror\u00a0set the template for innumerable puzzle movies to come. Three women from distinct milieus narrate their failed romances with the same doomed lothario. The film\u2019s gender politics are every bit as audacious as its fragmented narration and overlapping temporalities, with each undermining any notion of a stable personal identity. At a stylistic level,\u00a0The Three-Sided Mirror\u00a0is suffused with the kinds of kinetic thrills and visual detailing advocated in Epstein\u2019s writings: an exquisitely rendered telephone call, a reckless drive through a parking garage and the integration of documentary material in a carnival sequence.\u00a0Print courtesy Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.<\/p> <p>See you at the movie,<\/p> <p>John<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We can gather at the Grafton Street Pub at 5:15 for fuel and discussion of Young Oceans of Cinema","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group\/events\/229028708\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"The Fall of the House of Usher - Live Musical Accompaniment by Martin Marks","id":"229028708","time":1456531200000,"updated":1456621193000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1155954187000,"name":"Boston International\/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":307808,"urlname":"Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"595 North Ave","name":"Lakeside Inn (fka The Clarion)","lon":-71.084908,"id":24100393,"state":"MA","lat":42.51535,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.7824459076,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453735421000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's meet at 7:00 and mingle....music starts at 8:00<\/p> <p>This band packs them in....this place filled up quickly last time we saw them.\u00a0 Get there early to get a seat..<\/p> <p><br\/>You don't have to dance if you don't want to....most of us don't.

Imagine meeting new people in an environment where they feel comfortable to express themselves and challenge the edges of their comfort zones; a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>TurnON events give you the opportunity to look deeper into yourself, through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses. What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to be authentic. It's like a giant exhale when the rest of the world is asking you to hold it in. In just an hour, you may even forget that you are in Boston.<\/p> <p>TurnON Boston is an organization that teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON events are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without actually doing the practice. At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of OM and information on how to learn more.<\/p> <p>$10, payable at the door.<\/p> <p>Please arrive on time - we lock the door promptly at 7:40!<\/p> <p>Limited non-resident parking is available alongside our building on Dudley Street, or plentiful metered spaces on Mass Ave are only one block away (and free after 6pm).

Increasingly studies are attesting to the powerful effects sound vibration has on our physical and emotional well-being. What is a Mantra?<\/p> <p>Mantra, which means \u201cthat which saves the mind\u201d or \u201cinstruments of the mind\u201d, is a collection of mathematically precise and melodic Sanskrit sound vibrations designed for specific energetic intentions.<\/p> <p>Why is the Maha Mantra called the \u201cgreat\u201d Mantra?<\/p> <p>This specific Mantra deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for two reasons: 1) it is one of very few mantras that combines both the feminine and masculine divinities simultaneously. 2) It can be chanted at any time and place.<\/p> <p>What is the origin of the Maha Mantra?<\/p> <p>This Mantra is found in the Kali-santara Upanishad, one of the 108 principle Upanishads, and was given by Brahma to the sage Narada.<\/p> <p>What are the benefits of Japa Meditation?<\/p> <p>Because the Maha Mantra combines both the feminine and masculine it is a Bhakti mantra or \u201cmantra of loving relationships\u201d. This works on transforming and improving the practitioner\u2019s relationships on three levels - 1) Personal (relationship with oneself); 2) Interpersonal (relationships with others); and 3) Spiritual (relationship with the divine). Why Japa Circles?<\/p> <p>Japa Circles provide a powerful space in which the simultaneous recitation by all members amplifies the energy of the mantra exponentially. What takes place at a Japa Circle?<\/p> <p>For 15 minutes the practitioner fills out a four question survey and performs breathing and mindfulness exercises. For 30 minutes the actual Japa meditation takes place. Practitioners recite the mantra softly in rhythm and cadence with the instructor with increasingly relaxation and joy. The final 15 minutes is used for the concluding breathing exercises.<\/p> <p>What is the purpose of the Survey?<\/p> <p>Japa Circles and the various level s can only measure quantity of a practitioner\u2019s Japa meditation. The purpose of the survey, which is private and for the practitioner\u2019s personal use only, is to help measure the quality of a practitioner\u2019s Japa meditation. What is the purpose of the various levels?<\/p> <p>The Maha Mantra was handed down with a recommendation that the practitioner recite the mantra 35 million times!

Once on Green Way bear right at the green \u201cTraditions of Wayland\u201d sign, and continue downhill 0.2 mi to the cul-de-sac. Parking is near the informational kiosk.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please Read The Fine Print:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Duration: Approximately 1 1\/2 - 2hours for the hike. However, any time estimate given is just that. Actual times vary greatly according to weather, trail conditions and the group itself. \u00a0I am not responsible for getting you back in time for later in the day plans.\u00a0There is no way of knowing trail conditions ahead of time. Use your own judgment. Anyone with recurrent \"No Shows\" or about whom we have received complaints from fellow hikers will not be accepted. Please don't RSVP \"Yes\" unless you really intend to come. I am committed to being there for you. If you are not equally committed to being there, then please don't sign up.<\/p> <p>This is a group event and participants are expected to follow the lead, stay together, stop at junctions and support all participants should circumstances require teamwork. We start together and finish together. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own. We hike in light rain or showers, but heavy rain, snow or extreme cold weather cancels. Bring water, hiking boots or sneakers, bug spray, snacks and any personal medicines. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.<\/p> <p>Please remember that I am a volunteer, the event is free, and we are all adults. The people who have the best times on these hikes are those who stay loose and roll with things as they happen. If you are expecting Daniel Boone as your leader you will be very disappointed. If you need everything to run perfectly, this hike is not for you.<\/p> <p><br\/>By clicking the \"Yes\" option on the RSVP link you are agreeing to the Liability Waiver as stated below: \u00a0Remember: I am a volunteer.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 1 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 30 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

While Virgin Queen is probably over-ambitious for my current lifestyle, I would still like to kick off another trip around the sun with some gaming goodness. And, furthermore, because I have a screwed-up idea of what constitutes a \"fun party game,\" I'd like to take this chance to play a game of the sort that doesn't get played on a regular weekday night -- even if it's not one of my beloved Reformation-era dicefests. Some prime examples from my collection:<\/p> <p>18xx (I have 1830, 1856 and 18AL)<br\/>Game of Thrones<br\/>Indonesia<br\/>Die Macher<br\/>Maria<br\/>Republic of Rome<br\/>Roads and Boats<br\/>Struggle of Empires<br\/>Successors<br\/>Sword of Rome<br\/>Triumph and Tragedy<\/p> <p>Don't feel like you need to know the rules going in; it's pretty likely that whatever gets played is a learning game for someone.<\/p> <p>Hopefully we can hash out what people want to play in comments. (I have my preferences, but I'd be fine with anything above.) We have enough table space to have two (maybe even three) games running in parallel so if people want to branch out to something not in my collection, I say go for it you mad dog. Space IS limited, however, I would gently ask those of you who might be interested but only in one or two specific games to hold off on RSVPing until you know there's a group committed to what you want.<\/p> <p>Here's the gritty details:<\/p> <p>1. As some of you are aware, we have a new tiny human at home. While she will be at an age when she's not quite so vulnerable to nasty illnesses brought by friendly strangers, it remains true that February is flu season and new babies with the flu are no fun for mom and dad, so we would like to politely but firmly request that you bow out if you've got flu symptoms or are very recently recovering, and that everyone take common-sense precautions like handwashing when you visit. We also have a cat at home, so people who are allergic should take precautions.<\/p> <p>2. February is also snow season and while we're having a much more sedate winter than last year (knock on wood), if there is a big snowfall, the city can and will declare a snow emergency, which means no street parking. I'll try to keep everyone informed. We are accessible via several bus lines as well, so those who don't drive can get here. I'm happy to provide more specific advice on getting here for those who need it; don't be afraid to ask!<\/p> <p>3. I will provide some snacks and drinks but I certainly encourage those who are inclined and able to bring something to share as well.<\/p> <p>I think this will be a fun afternoon!

You can make the ordinary extraordinary through your photography.<\/p> <p>First, we will meet in front of Mike's Pastry and I will introduce you to some simple step by step practices for creative seeing so you can find beauty in the most unexpected places.<\/p> <p>I have designed a series of 45 minute practices we will do together that will improve your composition, depth of field, and basic camera settings. Then you will have some time on your own to wander.<\/p> <p>You will have a chance to try these out right away with my guidance. \u00a0You will receive individual coaching and critique while we are on the streets shooting. This way you can be confident that you will be able to repeat the process next time you are out on a shoot. This is a great session if you are interested in travel photography.<\/p> <p>We will work with color, texture, pattern, and light to make our photos come to life. As always, this is a non technical jargon zone. It is all about the creative act of seeing and capturing the moments of life with a fresh eye.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/b\/a\/600_433339130.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I used the rule of thirds to compose this image.

Over 500,000 guests have visited an Ice Castle since the company\u2019s establishment in 2009.<br\/>Facts About Ice Castles<\/p> <p>Each ice castle is built by hand and takes thousands of man-hours to create.<br\/>A team of 10-20 artists work day and night to build each ice castle by hand.<br\/>Ice castles use about 5 million gallons of water to build and maintain \u2013 every night 5-20 tons of ice is added as the castle gets watered and grows<br\/>All ice castles are located next to natural water sources so all of the water used returns directly to the environment<br\/>An ice castle spans about one acre<br\/>All of the lighting at the ice castle is frozen inside the ice \u2013 it makes for a surreal evening experience and during the day the ice takes on a glacial tone of deep blue Frozen wonderland returns to Lincoln, New Hampshire<\/p> <p>This winter, Ice Castles, LLC will bring its popular attraction back to Lincoln, New Hampshire, as it unveils a massive castle made of ice. The acre-sized winter wonderland is crafted by hand using only icicles and water, and resembles organic formations found in nature, like those of frozen waterfalls, glaciers or ice caves.<\/p> <p>Guests are invited to not only view the beauty of the structure but also to squeeze, squish and crawl through parts of the stunning, Narnia-like display. Favorite photo spots can be found in the throne room, in front of the waterfall and throughout the winding ice maze. Children will enjoy whizzing down the tubular ice slide and spelunking through small tunnels.<\/p> <p>Ice Castles are the brainchild of ice artist Brent Christensen, who is bringing Ice Castles to New Hampshire for a second consecutive year. The Ice Castle features millions of icicles that sparkle a glacial blue by day and glow multi-colored at night with the help of thousands of LED lights embedded in the ice.<\/p> <p>\u201cIce Castles are one of the most unique and beautiful places on earth,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cWhat\u2019s really special is that every visitor gets a distinctive experience since the ice is constantly melting, freezing and being reshaped. It\u2019s a continuously evolving and very interactive experience.\u201d<\/p> <p>Where: 64 Railroad Street, Lincoln, New Hampshire, 03251<\/p> <p>When: Jan. 9 through March 2015, weather permitting<\/p> <p>Hours: 2-9 p.m. Sunday-Thursday, 2-10 p.m. on Fridays, and noon-10 p.m on Saturdays<\/p> <p>Tickets: General admission tickets for ages 12+ are $8.95 Monday-Thursday and $12.95 Friday-Sunday.

However, to be a well-informed vegetarian is even better. Let\u2019s plan to read together great vegetarian books, watch movies\/documentaries and, later, discuss them in a circle of vegetarian friends. Book selections will be recommended by a professional librarian or by you. Please provide me with your wish list of books that you want to read together as a group. We will plan to meet on a monthly basis.<\/p> <p>Our January discussion went very well and we have even compiled a great book and movie wish list from the attendees. For our February discussion, we can either watch the documentary That Sugar Film (2015), read Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us (2014), do both or simply show up to join in for a discussion over a cup of coffee, a tea, or a light meal.<\/p> <p>About the Documentary:<\/p> <p>That Sugar Film (2015) began as one man's journey to discover the bitter truth about sugar. Damon Gameau, who is a star and a director of this documentary, embarked on a unique experiment to document the effects of a high sugar diet on a healthy body, consuming only foods that are commonly perceived, or promoted to be 'healthy\u2019. Through this entertaining and informative journey, Damon highlights some of the issues that plague the sugar industry, and where sugar lurks on the supermarket shelves. That Sugar Film will forever change the way you think about \u201chealthy foods\u201d.<\/p> <p>About the Book:<\/p> <p>Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us (2014) by Michael Moss was named as one of the best books of the year by numerous magazines and newspapers. It is a #1 New York Times Best Seller and a winner of the James Beard Foundation Award for Writing and Literature.<br\/>From a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter at The New York Times comes the explosive story of the rise of the processed food industry and its link to the emerging obesity epidemic. Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Metro-Boston-Vegetarians\/events\/228514686\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":3600000,"name":"Discussion of That Sugar Film and Salt Sugar Fat.","id":"228514686","time":1456610400000,"updated":1456615243000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424266793000,"name":"Social Metro Boston Vegetarians","group_lon":-71.2200012207,"id":18443485,"urlname":"Social-Metro-Boston-Vegetarians","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Vegetarians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02210","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"2 Northern Ave.","name":"Daily Catch Seaport, Outdoor Grotto","lon":-71.04686,"id":3263122,"state":"MA","lat":42.353455,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.26730418205,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456513795000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>By signing up and\/or attending a Boston Area Photography Group meetup you agree to the Boston Area Photography Group Disclaimer below.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>No guests are permitted on Boston Area Photography Group events.

A wide variety of meat is prepared and cooked on the BBQ grill. It is traditionally served on skewers. The traditional Brazilian BBQ is enjoyed over several hours which is perfect for a wine tasting event. We will taste the flights of wines and enjoy some delicious grilled meats, I hope you can join me while I share a part of my culture with you. I plan to prepare: white rice (arroz branco), bean casserole (feilao terpeiro), tomato sauce (vinegrete), fried cassava (mandioca frita), and for the meat we will have beef tenderloin, pork ribs, chicken wings, chicken wrapped in bacon, pork sausage and finally for dessert flan and rice pudding. Keep in mind that in traditional Brazilian BBQ the meat is the main course. I look forward to seeing what wines pair best with one of my favorite cultural dining experiences.

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front. Also remember a hat, you need to have your head\/hair covered to serve.<\/p> <p>\u00a0My telephone number if you have any questions or have a last minute change to status is[masked]<\/p> <p>2 things:<br\/>1. Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show.

Even if you don't get to finish it, please join us!<\/p> <p>From Amazon: In an era of mommy blogs, Pinterest, and Facebook, The Good Mother Myth dismantles the social media-fed notion of what it means to be a \"good mother.\" This collection of essays takes a realistic look at motherhood and provides a platform for real voices and raw stories, each adding to the narrative of motherhood we don't tend to see in the headlines or on the news.<\/p> <p>From tales of mind-bending, panic-inducing overwhelm to a reflection on using weed instead of wine to deal with the terrible twos, the honesty of the essays creates a community of mothers who refuse to feel like they're in competition with others, or with the notion of the ideal mom--they're just trying to find a way to make it work. With a foreword by Christy Turlington Burns and a contributor list that includes Jessica Valenti, Sharon Lerner, Soraya Chemaly, Amber Dusick and many more, this remarkable collection seeks to debunk the myth and offer some honesty about what it means to be a mother.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1580055028?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1580055028?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Camberville-Moms-Book-Group\/events\/228610220\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's meet for coffee and discuss \"The Good Mother Myth\"","id":"228610220","time":1456682400000,"updated":1456694923000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454600920000,"name":"Boston & Camberville Moms Book Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":19508753,"urlname":"Boston-Camberville-Moms-Book-Group","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Book Worms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"339 Salem Street","name":"TaggArt Studio","lon":-71.049339,"id":24389637,"state":"MA","lat":42.514847,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.7725610733,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456414982000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Register to attend this beauty + style event and you will receive a new profile photo from photographer David West ($75 tickets are available via EventBrite - see link below).

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

We will provide paper, glue and instructions, and you will provide your hands and patience (it can take some time to fold 30-60 pieces of paper!). Materials cost donations are appreciated.<\/p> <p>The standard popular kusudama model made up of 5-pointed flowers and joined with will be taught. Some alternative kusudama models will be available to look at and youtube is available for the more adventurous who want to learn some more complicated models. Models I (Lisa) am familiar with and could refresh are \u201cElectra\u201d \u201cEsmeralda\u201d and\u00a0 \u201cGreat Stellated Dodecahedron\u201d.<\/p> <p>If you wish to fully assemble a kusudama during the event, please be sure to show up early enough to complete it, or you will need to have materials at home to finish. It can take a couple of hours to make one depending on how fast you produce the units.<\/p> <p>The event will be held at Lisa\u2019s home in Belmont. To come by T take the 73 from Harvard square (the 71 also stops fairly close). Plenty of non-permit on street parking for those who drive in.

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

OSWALD'S DAY<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>A Saint born on leap year day might often get overlooked, so let's take a close look at this Saint Oswald from England!<\/p> <p>The last acts in the life of today's saint make for an amazing story. In truth, they merely underscore the holiness he exhibited throughout his life.<\/p> <p>Born into a military family in 10th-century England, Oswald was a nephew of the archbishop of Canterbury, who raised him and played a crucial role in his early education. Oswald continued his studies abroad in France, where he became a Benedictine monk.<\/p> <p>Following his appointment as bishop of Worcester, and later as archbishop of York, he founded monasteries and introduced many reforms. He supported\u2014and improved\u2014scholarship at the abbeys he established, inviting leading thinkers in such fields as mathematics and astronomy to share their learnings.<\/p> <p>He was widely known for his sanctity, especially his love for the poor. The final winter of his life was spent at the cathedral in Worcester that he so loved. At the start of Lent in February of the year 992, he resumed his usual practice of washing the feet of 12 poor men each day. <b><i>On Leap Year Day, February 29, he died after kissing the feet of the 12th man and giving a blessing.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>The news of Oswald's death brought an outpouring of grief throughout the city.<\/p> <p><b><i>THE RADIO SHOW \"CALLED TO COMMUNION\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>We are inviting all our non-Catholic friends especially, along with our Catholic ones, as there will be an opportunity for interactive live radio correspondence on this Internationally broadcast show. Several telephones will be available to call and ask questions about the Catholic Faith, particularly ones that non-Catholics may want clarified or even challenged. \"What's preventing YOU from becoming a Catholic?\" Perhaps something someone has told you, or maybe you just cannot figure out why the Church teaches something, or indeed if She even does! We are all called to Communion with Jesus Christ and the Holy Church that he founded. We already have at least a couple of our non-Catholic friends attending.<\/p> <p>After the show we will pray from Psalms (Evening Prayer from the Divine Office), hold a brief Cooking Class and afterwards enjoy some food together.<\/p> <p>Th link for today's Prayer is at the following:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/divineoffice.org\/xmas-after-epiphany-wed-ep2\/?date=20160106\"><a href=\"http:\/\/divineoffice.org\/lent-w03-mon-ep?date=20160229\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/divineoffice.org\/lent-w03-mon-ep?date=20160229<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Great radio talk-show with Dr. David Anders, a convert to the Catholic Faith.

It's more affordable and available than the archetypical system of network attached storage (NAS) appliances running the network file system (NFS). We've made two key observations: first, by coupling conflict resolution, key-value lookup, and version control, availability is guaranteed by accepting inconsistency under minor failure modes; second, since most disk operations are metadata lookups, by reducing per-image metadata, machines can perform metadata lookups in memory, which conserves disk operations for reading data, thereby increasing overall throughput.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n7:30 - 7:40: 1 min pitches from audience.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering.

Numerous film festivals have short script competitions, and many writers and filmmakers got their start with short scripts. In this workshop, you will learn what goes into writing a great short script. The class will cover story, structure, character, dialogue, and action, and also how to develop an idea that can work for a short film. Please view the short film SCHWARZFAHRER (The Black Rider) on Youtube. We'll also watch one or two other films in the workshop.<\/p> <p>NOTE: This workshop is part of a series of workshops and meetups designed to help you prepare for our upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/flicks4chicks.org\/\">Flicks4Chicks<\/a> one-month film competition.

introduction will help newer members start using PGN more effectively. \u00a0It is intended for members who have attended fewer than three PGN events. \u00a0It is useful for other members who would like greater familiarity with PGN.<\/p> <p>- Is PGN right for you?<br\/>- How can PGN help you?<br\/>- The best way to start benefiting from PGN<br\/>- Basic navigation for PGN<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Personal Growth Network<\/b><\/p> <p>The Personal Growth Network is a first-of-its-kind meta-organizer, bringing together diverse personal growth and positive psychology tools and techniques that are designed to help generally healthy people create greater joy and more success in all parts of their life. \u00a0Members can try out, learn, and practice numerous approaches; they can select some approaches for more in-depth study and application to their lives; they can practice, support, and share a particular approach with other members; and they can return to PGN to explore different approaches or to work on other parts of their life. \u00a0<\/p> <p>PGN is also a community of like-hearted people who share an important, but not widely distributed, combination of values and characteristics (e.g.,\u00a0curiosity, willingness to learn,\u00a0willingness\u00a0to change habits)\u00a0around consciously and proactively crafting a life well-lived. \u00a0For people with this important combination of characteristics, engaging with other members of the community can be fascinating, supportive, and affirming.<\/p> <p>And finally, PGN is a toolbox with which members can create successful events. \u00a0Members can create workshops, practice groups, and social events through which they can\u00a0share their journey, their gifts, their joy, their successes, their vision, and their interests.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Orientation Series<\/b><\/p> <p>Given the enormous ambition and power of the Personal Growth Network, and its rapid growth, it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed at first, so we will be offering some \"How-To\" guides to maximize your utilization of the Personal Growth Network for whatever your life goals may be. \u00a0This is the first of those guides, and is useful for any other guide (including those designed for leaders and for hosts.)<\/p> <p>Other planned Orientations include those for:<\/p> <p>- More regular users of PGN<br\/>- PGN members who would like to reduce emails<br\/>- Potential PGN leaders<br\/>- PGN leaders who want to post events<br\/>- PGN leaders who want to reach more people<br\/>- Potential HeartBeat Salon hosts<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About This Particular Orientation:<\/b><\/p> <p>There is no prerequisite to take this Orientation. \u00a0It is conceived of primarily for those members who are new to PGN, or have not tried out many events. \u00a0Some of the concepts introduced here are useful in more advanced Orientations.<\/p> <p>I will also try to address any specific questions that you post below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About The Technology:<\/b><\/p> <p>This Orientation is offered as a \"Webinar\". \u00a0This means that you will need a computer, and you will need to be in a location where you can listen and watch without distractions. \u00a0(There will be opportunities for open discussion as well, so you may want to look presentable. )<\/p> <p>The webinar software used is Zoom. \u00a0It runs on most platforms. \u00a0If you have not run it before, please click on the link a half-hour before to ensure that it is working on your system.<\/p> <p>The link will be sent to you the

the games that work best in a cafe setting.<\/p> <p>Our main meetup requires RSVPs due to heavy popularity and finite space. \u00a0This event runs simultaneously, two buildings away. \u00a0<b>RSVPs are NOT required for this event.<\/b>\u00a0 RSVPs are still appreciated so the event hosts know how many people to expect, but you don't need to update them and can come even if you don't RSVP.<\/p>

regular meetup at that point,\u00a0no RSVP required.<\/p> <p>Cosi Cafe has graciously allowed us to use their back seating area every week. \u00a0You are not required to buy anything from them, but their food is honestly pretty good, so please take advantage of them if you are hungry for dinner, soft drinks, or snacks.<\/p> <p><img

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items - about 5-8 different vegetables and 2-3 fruits, and you're often 'gifted' with extra items - 30 ounce jug of fresh hummus or lentil salad or chickpea salads, pound of garlic, large one-lb plastic container of ground pepper, or lots of other 'big items' we don't typically buy.]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Make us busy -

See other talks she\u2019s given here.Sarah will be interviewed in front of a live audience about her adventures and accomplishments by Heidi Legg, the journalist behind the popular Boston newsletter TheEditorial.com.<\/p> <p>She enjoyed a wild childhood in the countryside, climbing trees and watching birds for hours at a time. When she was a child, she burned with an intense curiosity. This inner thrill for discovery would shape her, make her flexible but strong. She emerged from childhood ready for the next step.\u00a0<\/p> <p>With no pocket money, Sarah started the thankless task of slug hunting in the family vegetable garden at the age of seven. She earned one franc for every 100 slugs. No matter the weather, she worked and saved to have the eight francs she needed for a copy of her dream magazine, National Geographic.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When she was eight years old she took off with her dog to spend the night in a cave and didn\u2019t tell anyone where she was going. Her taste for traveling brought her to Australia, but it was in New Zealand that she encountered the full experience of walking. It was here that she made her decision: she would walk to fulfill her desire for discovery, and her need to try to understand Life. She spent time in Patagonia, where kilometer after kilometer she explored the land. She stayed in Moorea (French Polynesia) where she was attracted to the beauty of the islands and their inhabitants. She explored Canada by canoe and in 2000 she crossed the United States by foot, from the Canadian border to the Mexican border: it was 4,260 kilometers in four months and six days on a path full of obstacles. It was the famous PCT. At that point she thought she had reached the limit of her abilities. But then the Australian bush beckoned her once again (over the years she has returned regularly to rejuvenate). From up in the snowy mountains of Switzerland, she thought up a wild plan: to cross the Australian deserts alone and on foot\u2026\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cThe fire that had always burned inside me would become my passion, my job, my life.\u201d<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>HEIDI LEGG \u00a0is the Founder of TheEditorial.com where she interviews visionaries and thinkers around her in Boston and Cambridge, USA.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229058260\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"PARTY GAME NIGHT","id":"229058260","time":1456873200000,"updated":1456937919000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newton","address_1":"46 Marcellus Drive","name":"Vegan home of Eat to Thrive graduate","lon":-71.19931,"id":24362501,"state":"MA","lat":42.30999,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":7.4693107605,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454456345000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>About\u00a0the\u00a0Course<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/5\/600_446502117.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Runs from March 1-May 10, 2016\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Except April 19 during school vacation<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Support Real Kids Real Food.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0All proceeds of this non-profit benefit\u00a0go towards this after-school program<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Achieve your goals with an individual\u00a0health coach and peer supports<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Relish a 5-course vegan meal at each\u00a0class<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Hear natural health experts speak and\u00a0watch chef presenters<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Learn to grow your own nutrient-packed\u00a0sprouts<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Gain hands-on experience in preparing\u00a0mouth-watering live food<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Achieve you ideal weight easily and\u00a0naturally<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Find a community of like-minded people\u00a0who believe in a lifestyle that will keep you\u00a0healthy for life<\/p> <p>** For more information please visit the website below**<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.optimumhealthsolution.org\/2014\/05\/03\/rally-world-food-justice\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.optimumhealthsolution.org\/2014\/05\/03\/rally-world-food-justice\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.optimumhealthsolution.org\/2014\/05\/03\/rally-world-food-justice\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>or\u00a0<\/p> <p>Contact me:[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RawBoston\/events\/228564358\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Eat to Thrive Course","id":"228564358","time":1456873200000,"updated":1456946310000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191615749000,"name":"Boston N.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

AGNES OF \u00a0BOHEMIA DAY<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Agnes was the daughter of Queen Constance and King Ottokar I of Bohemia. At the age of three, she was betrothed to the Duke of Silesia, who died three years later. As she grew up, she decided she wanted to enter the religious life.<\/p> <p>After declining marriages to King Henry VII of Germany and Henry III of England, Agnes was faced with a proposal from Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor. She appealed to Pope Gregory IX for help. The pope was persuasive; Frederick magnanimously said that he could not be offended if Agnes preferred the King of Heaven to him.<\/p> <p>After Agnes built a hospital for the poor and a residence for the friars, she financed the construction of a Poor Clare monastery in Prague. In 1236, she and seven other noblewomen entered this monastery. St. Clare sent five sisters from San Damiano to join them, and wrote Agnes four letters advising her on the beauty of her vocation and her duties as abbess.<\/p> <p>Agnes became known for prayer, obedience and mortification. Papal pressure forced her to accept her election as abbess; nevertheless, the title she preferred was \"senior sister.\" Her position did not prevent her from cooking for the other sisters and mending the clothes of lepers. The sisters found her kind but very strict regarding the observance of poverty; she declined her royal brother\u2019s offer to set up an endowment for the monastery.<\/p> <p>Agnes had no children of her own but was certainly life-giving for all who knew her.\u00a0Devotion to Agnes arose soon after her death on March 6, 1282. She was canonized in 1989.<\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><b><i>THE RADIO SHOW \"CALLED TO COMMUNION\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>We are also inviting all our non-Catholic friends especially, along with our Catholic ones, as there will be an opportunity for interactive live radio correspondence on this Internationally broadcast show. Several telephones will be available to call and ask questions about the Catholic Faith, particularly ones that non-Catholics may want clarified or even challenged. \"What's preventing YOU from becoming a Catholic?\" Perhaps something someone has told you, or maybe you just cannot figure out why the Church teaches something, or indeed if She even does! We are all called to Communion with Jesus Christ and the Holy Church that he founded.

The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) and his formidable Secret Service agent (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6 agent (Charlotte Riley) who rightly trusts no one.

REVIEWS -<\/p> <p>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood!<br\/>Sara you are an angel among angels.<br\/>I am grateful. Thank you 3. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>4. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>5. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>6. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/228959311\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Women's Only Relaxing Restorative Sound Bath","id":"228959311","time":1456963200000,"updated":1457014954000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"449 Broadway","name":"Grow Native Massachusetts at the Cambridge Public Library","lon":-71.111092,"id":24284408,"state":"MA","lat":42.373322,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.29571223259,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452012251000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Presented by Grow Native Massachusetts.<\/p> <p>If we are to make our residential landscapes truly living ecosystems once again, we need to understand the specialized relationships that make plants and animals interdependent.

In 2010 and 11 Corey was a semi-finalist in the Boston Comedy Festival and was the winner of The Funniest Comic in New England Contest. He has been entertaining since childhood. Growing up in Milton - a small suburb in Massachusetts - and spending a lot of time in the city at his family\u2019s barbershop businesses allowed Corey to bring a diverse voice to the stage. Since a very early age he's had the ability to impersonate many different voices. He often left family members in tears at gatherings. It wasn't rare for him to startle his childhood classmates by imitating a teacher or principal's voice in the hallways.<\/p> <p>Corey made a quick transition from class clown to professional headliner out his \u201cno holds barred\u201d training provided by Boston\u2019s Improv Asylum. From there he became a part of his own short form improv troupe, Flaming Awesome. Referred to as funny, endearing, edgy, quick and exceptionally likeable when he is on the stage, Corey owns the crowd.<\/p> <p>He has also starred in the Independent film Business is War, directed by the late Kemal Gordon, \u201cCorey Rodrigues plays \u2018Black,\u2019 a financially challenged individual whose erratic funny cameos bring random laughter at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d - Entertainment Source 617 \u201cThe rest of the cast stands out as well; especially Corey Rodrigues as the comedy relief character Black.\u201d - The Martha\u2019s Vineyard Film Festival.<\/p> <p>Additionally, Corey has been able to use his comedic gift to impact the community by raising money for Dana Farber, The Pan Mass Challenge, The American Cancer Society, Rebuilding Boston Together, The Jimmy Fund, The Blue Angels of Manchester, CT and countless other charities.<\/p> <p>Also on this show will be:<br\/>Nick Lavellee<br\/>Andrew Durso<br\/>&amp; More!<\/p> <p>Hosted by Ian Barton<\/p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm, show at 8pm.<\/p> <p>Get Tickets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/limelight-comedy-club-tickets-19117827938\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/limelight-comedy-club-tickets-19117827938<\/a><\/p> <p>Limelight Comedy Club is Boston's newest stand-up comedy venue, featuring the hottest up and coming comics working today.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Through effects and looping, he attempts to elevate beatboxing from mere gimmickry to a sophisticated art form. Now located in Boston, Green has performed at several beatbox and hip hop events around New Haven, CT and the Benton.<\/p> <p>He will bless a venue that many artist have passed in their rite of passage. Beat Research is a monthly event promoting experimental party music.<\/p> <p>Beat Research began in March 2004 at the Enormous Room in Central Square. The brainchild of multimedia artists Jake Trussell (DJ C) and Antony Flackett (DJ Flack), who teaches a hands-on class at MassArt by the same name, Beat Research provided a new base for the genre-bending sets the two had been playing since throwing parties with the Toneburst Collective in the late 90s. Bridging parochial club divides, Flack and C would overlay dub and jungle, hip-hop and dubstep, dancehall and bhangra and beats from all over. After co-hosting the residency for 3+ years, in 2007 DJ C moved to Chicago while musicologist and blogger Wayne Marshall (Wayne &amp; Wax) returned to Cambridge, bringing his big Caribbeanist ears, YouTube dragnet, and love of \"musically-expressed ideas about music\" to the mix. In September 2012, our long time friend and collaborator Pacey Foster (aka DJ PACE) a true Beat Scholar\/PartyRocker took over co-host duties from Wayne and is now holding it down strong with Flack. In its 7.5 year run at the Enormous Room, Beat Research played host to some of the best and brightest DJs and producers of underground bass music in the world, gave a number of young Boston luminaries their first gig, and presented an utterly motley collection of tech-addled live PAs. The long list of special guests includes Scuba, DJ Rupture, Kingdom, edIT, Mungo's Hi-Fi, Uproot Andy, and thereminist Pamelia Kurstin.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Lieberman<\/p> <p>Runtime: 110 minutes<\/p> <p>Released in USA, 2015<\/p> <p>Nina Simone nee Eunice Waymon, was left out of Civil Rights history, erased by jazz critics, and\u00a0forgotten by most Americans because no one knew how to categorize her\u00a0greatness. \u00a0But throughout the 1960s, Nina Simone was both loved and feared for her outspoken vision of Black Freedom. \u00a0Her musical proclamations like \"Mississippi Goddam\", and her iconic style gave voice to people of all colors\u00a0facing oppression, and continues to empower today with its unrelenting appeal for justice. Today, Nina is more popular eleven years after her death than ever before. President Barack Obama listed \u2018Sinnerman\u2019 in his top 5 favorite songs, and whether re-mixed, re-sampled or in its pure form, Nina\u2019s music continues to empower people around the world with its unrelenting appeal for justice.\u00a0Now the story of America's most overlooked musical genius is finally brought to light in the acclaimed new documentary film, \u201cThe Amazing Nina Simone.\u201d<\/p> <p>Director Jeff L. Lieberman (\u201dRe-Emerging: The Jews of Nigeria\u201d) brings audiences on Nina\u2019s journey from the segregated South, through the worlds of classical music, jazz joints &amp; international concert halls. Navigating through the twists &amp; turns of the 1960\u2019s fight for racial equality, the film delves deep into Nina\u2019s artistry and intentions, and is told through over 50 exclusive and intimate interviews with the people who knew Nina best: her friends, family, musicians and fellow activists.\u00a0Eric Burdon\u00a0(The Animals),\u00a0Sam Waymon\u00a0(Nina\u2019s Brother &amp; Longtime Band Member),\u00a0Nikki Giovanni\u00a0(Poet, Professor &amp; Friend) &amp;\u00a0Marie Christine Dunham-Pratt\u00a0(Nina's Lover &amp; Friend) are just a few of the people who\u00a0answer long-held questions behind Nina's most beloved songs, bold style, controversial statements, and the reason she left America.<\/p> <p><b>Seating is limited so strongly suggest arriving at 5:30.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/a\/f\/600_447432719.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/c\/c\/600_447432748.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/1\/3\/600_447432819.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/a\/4\/600_447432708.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/a\/9\/600_447432713.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/b\/a\/600_447432730.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/2\/4\/600_447432836.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonOnyxbirds\/events\/229299053\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"The Amazing Nina Simone - FREE Film Screening Thu Mar 3","id":"229299053","time":1457046000000,"updated":1457137306000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1197747806000,"name":"Boston \"Onyxbirds\" Travel Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":877771,"urlname":"BostonOnyxbirds","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Onyxbirds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Littleton","address_1":"410 Great Rd Suite 3-3-2","name":"Old Mill in Littleton","lon":-71.474319,"id":24276085,"state":"MA","lat":42.547012,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.3765544891,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451581131000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to learn something new?

How to bring people together who would love to participate but often don\u2019t know how on the one side, and maintainers who appreciate every kind of contribution on the other? There seems to be a big gap, because if there is one thing we learned at &lt;a&gt;Hoodie&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/jsconf.com\/\">the JS Conf family<\/a>, both sides exist, but we are still figuring out how to close the gap.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this talk, I\u2019ll talk about what works for Hoodie, and how people perceive us as [<a href=\"https:\/\/opensource.com\/life\/16\/2\/hoodie-open-source-community)\">\u201cone of the most diverse and inclusive\u00a0 [Open Source] communities\u201d<\/a>], without the code part being even ready :) Expect a lot of practical tips that will help you contribute to open source (with so much more than just code), and how to maintain and grow your own projects without loosing the fun and burning yourself out.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Name-your-contributors: A node module for fostering community by including everyone who helps<br\/><\/b><i>Richard Littauer (<a href=\"http:\/\/burntfen.com\/\">website<\/a> <\/i>|<i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richlitt\">twitter<\/a> <\/i>| <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/RichardLitt\">github<\/a><i>)<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Great coding projects and great communities are linked; but building a great community takes a good deal of work. I've built a tool to help with one aspect; praising contributors. `name-your-contributors` names everyone who has interacted on GitHub - not just with code, but also with comments, code review, or issue creation. I use it currently in weekly emails for the IPFS team, and will like to talk about it's reception, it's development, and how to get other communities using it, too.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Building communities with social scientific software at Public Lab<br\/><\/b><i>Jeff Warren\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/unterbahn.com\/thesis\/\">website<\/a> <\/i>|<i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jywarren\">twitter<\/a>\u00a0<\/i>|<i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jywarren\">github<\/a>)<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Public Lab's approach of using socially-oriented web-based software for scientific analysis is part of its broader move to recast environmental research as something that's done in public, by the public. By making a website with user profiles, comments, and Git-style forking the center of the data collection and analysis process, Public Lab creates on-ramps for new users, encourages peer support and troubleshooting, and builds a culture of remixing and replication. This has evolved in parallel with a move towards JS-based, client-side processing of data using emerging web standards such as WebRTC, CSS3, and other HTML5 features.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston_JS\/events\/228985335\/","yes_rsvp_count":76,"duration":9000000,"name":"typeof topic === 'undefined' && 'March Meetup';","id":"228985335","time":1457047800000,"updated":1457125967000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1198023423000,"name":"BostonJS","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":884541,"urlname":"boston_JS","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"JavaScripters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01824","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chelmsford","address_1":"90 Drum Hill Rd","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-71.361862,"id":5728532,"state":"MA","lat":42.622475,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5000076294,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406474351000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet monthly to discuss items of interest to the Linux community.

Inside us and everywhere around us, life is vibrating. In fact, each of us has a personal vibration that accurately communicates who we are to the world and helps shape our reality. The Book Frequency by Penny Pierce shows readers how to feel their personal vibration, improve it, and use it to shift their life from ordinary to extraordinary. A simple shift in frequency can change depression to peace, anger to stillness, and fear to enthusiasm.<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Frequency<\/i> gives readers a reassuring, step-by-step roadmap into a positive state of awareness that Peirce calls The Intuition Age. By learning to use \"frequency principles\" \u2014 methods based on the way energy actually functions \u2014 readers can keep their energy level high and productive, receive subtle information directly from the environment via \"empathic resonance,\" and quickly free themselves from negative or low \"vibrations.\"<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Join us for a LoA Book Conversation and feel your vibrations Rise!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>You do not need to have read the book to attend.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Frequency is about 250 pages, we will review Chapters 1-6 in this meetup and the remainder next month.<\/p> <p>This will be an open forum style book review, highly recommended to take notes while reading to share your highlights\/low lights.<\/p> <p>Frequency gives readers the tools to understand how and why their natural frequency interacts with the world around them.<\/p> <p>Weaving together basic ideas from quantum physics with proven intuition development techniques, Frequency takes readers into deeper concepts only hinted at in recent popular books and DVD's featuring the Law of Attraction. By learning to refine the \"conscious sensitivity\" of their body, readers can improve relationships, find upscale solutions to problems, and materialize a life that contains everything they want and need to live their destiny.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nFacilitators: Ellen Sklaver &amp; Sue Collins<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are right above McGill's Convenient Store, on the 2nd Floor.
