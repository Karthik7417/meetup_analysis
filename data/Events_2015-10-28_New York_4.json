This will make for a more equality consciousness in the group with out people standing out as being more spiritually Conscious then others.. it is not the purpose of this group to talk about our personal Spiritual experiences but to learn the teachings and techniques <b>to have our own Spiritual experiences and awakening,<\/b> that is our focus.<\/p> <p><br\/>Look forward to seeing you all then.<\/p> <p><br\/>Peace &amp; Blessings<\/p> <p><br\/>Mindy &amp; Anthony<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Just west of Newbridge Rd. going west on Merrick Rd. and it's on the right","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FREE-ASCENDED-MASTER-PRACTICE-AND-STUDY-GROUP-MEETUP-L-I\/events\/225281455\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"FREE ASCENDED MASTER GUIDED MEDITATION AND STUDY GROUP L.I.","id":"225281455","time":1444347000000,"updated":1444353856000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427049592000,"name":"ASCENDED MASTER FREE GUIDED MEDITATION AND STUDY GROUP L.I.","group_lon":-73.5299987793,"id":18515277,"urlname":"FREE-ASCENDED-MASTER-PRACTICE-AND-STUDY-GROUP-MEETUP-L-I","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Light Workers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Nyack","address_1":"146 S Highland Avenue","name":"Nyack College","lon":-73.930954,"id":23648422,"state":"NY","lat":41.087673,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.581615448,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444144424000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dr. Gregory A.

(Joshua 7:10)\u00a0 Once revealed, we need to confess our sins to Him (and repent of them) and, if appropriate, to those whom we offended.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to assume the sins of the nation on ourselves; just as Daniel did for the sins of the nation of Israel (Daniel 9).<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0 It is absolutely crucial that in all these endeavors that prayer be our primary focus.\u00a0 We need to rely on prayer (Jesus) as the foundation for everything that we do.\u00a0 In addition, prayer teams need to be set up that will pray before, during, and after all events, etc. in order to bath in prayer everything that we do.\u00a0 These prayer teams will be the \u201cheavy lifters\u201d who will be moving heaven and earth for us as we fight to regain our nation.<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0 We should follow (among other prayers in the Word), the prayers of repentance and requests for restoration that we find in the Bible, as we pray for our nation.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Focus:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 Jesus is the only way and the only power that will enable our nation to turn around (2 Cor 7:14). We need to focus on Him and to trust in Him alone, as we confess and turn from our sins; that He will tear down the strongholds of the enemy in our nation and in our individual lives. \u201cWhen the enemy comes in; like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.\u201d (Isa 59:19). We must not trust in any tactic, procedure, or whatever in order to overcome the devil (who is behind all of the evil that we see around us). \u201cFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\u201d Ephesians 6:11-13<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to ensure that we stay focused.\u00a0 The enemy (Satan) will try different tactics against us, e.g., to get our focus off of that which is most important and to either divert our attention on that which is least important and\/or try to get us to do too much.\u00a0 He will probably try to bring division amongst us.\u00a0 My guess is that it would be through misunderstandings, hurt feelings, etc.\u00a0 We must be aware of this up-front, expecting the attacks and to realize that the attacks are coming from the enemy and not from what we can, e.g., see with our natural eyes.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Tactics:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 We need to find appropriate Scriptures to stand upon to bring before the Lord as we pray individually and corporately.\u00a0 It is crucial that we not follow a hard fast cook book approach; even one that is based on the Bible.\u00a0 We need to know what the Scriptures say and then to allow the Holy Spirit to use what He\u2019s taught us to do or to pray those things that He brings to mind or puts into our hearts to do.\u00a0 For example, don\u2019t have the \u201cHail Mary\u201d prayer approach, e.g., I always have to pray this way or to pray these prayers in this exact order.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 The Church needs to be actively involved in politics and other social endeavors such as education, health care, the legal system, etc. (if even just knowing what is going on). In politics, the Body should then intelligently and with Christ-like love contact their representatives making their viewpoints known.\u00a0 These godly leaders need to then rally the Body perhaps at local auditoriums, stadiums, etc. in order show the Church the truth about how our nation began and how the Church was actively involved in all facets of social life for the first few hundred years of our pre- and post-national existence.\u00a0 The Body needs to learn that we must stand on what God\u2019s Word says and to fight for what\u2019s ours (just as the Israelites entered the Promised Land, fought huge giants, and won).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, remember:<\/p> <p>2 Chron 16:9 \u201cFor the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him\u2026\u201d<\/p> <p><b>PREPARATION FOR PRAYER-STUDY MATERIALS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Repentance from Idolatry<\/b><\/p> <p>All the sins described below are the symptoms of a bigger sickness, which is denying God as our creator and not glorifying him and acknowledging him as the supreme ruler of the universe. Rom 1:29 states \u201cAll Unrighteousness\u201d stems out from the root of idolatry (Rom1:23). So, fornication is not a sickness, it is one of the symptoms of idolatry, covetousness is not a sickness, it is another symptom of idolatry, etc.<\/p> <p>It is very important to focus our prayer efforts on this first cause of sin, which is ignoring God, suppressing the truth, and replacing the Creator by the created. God and truth are self-evident, but we choose to rebel against it. What we need is to repent from that.<\/p> <p>Studying the nature of repentance would help tremendously in our efforts to pray and intercede for people because repentance is the key to come back to God and be healed.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:18\u00a0 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:19\u00a0 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it<\/i> unto them.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:20\u00a0 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even<\/i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:21\u00a0 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him<\/i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:22\u00a0 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:23\u00a0 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:24\u00a0 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:25\u00a0 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:26\u00a0 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:27\u00a0 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:28\u00a0 And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their<\/i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:29\u00a0 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:30\u00a0 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:31\u00a0 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:32\u00a0 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s an example of what causes repentance:<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America focus on the much that we have, so our hearts is filled with thanksgiving for his goodness towards us, and our hearts lead us to repentance.<\/p> <p>Rom_2:4\u00a0 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that the end result of America\u2019s tribulations, the recession, the aging and health deterioration of Americans, the financial distress, etc. work for our good, changing our hearts and drawing closer to God.<\/p> <p>2Co_7:10\u00a0 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America realize that God wants every American to be saved and not face judgment. Let\u2019s pray that our pastors emphasize the human responsibility in determining our final destiny<\/p> <p>2Pe_3:9\u00a0 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<\/p> <p>Other observations on the word Repentance<\/p> <p>The word repentance is used in connection with God, as well as with man. When it is used in connection with God, it is usually positive. God never repents to do good for his people. God repents himself from exercising judgment and punishment on his people.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that God will change his mind executing the punishment that we deserve.<\/p> <p>Num_23:19\u00a0 God <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i>it?<\/i> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<\/p> <p>1Sa_15:29\u00a0 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should repent.<\/p> <p>Psa_110:4\u00a0 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art<\/i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.<\/p> <p>Psa_135:14\u00a0 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.<\/p> <p>Jer_18:8\u00a0 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<\/p> <p>Satan is the God of this world. He endows his faithful servants with power to promote sin from the top down. In that sense, it is very important to know that sin is not based on grass root strategies; it is a highly organized well-funded push strategy.<\/p> <p>Blindness comes from Satan.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray in the Name of Jesus and bind Satan\u2019s power, rebuke his authority, and order him to take away his hands off America. Let\u2019s pray that the spiritual veil be torn and people be able to see what\u2019s evident.<\/p> <p>2Co_4:4\u00a0 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<\/p> <p><b>Joh 12:40<\/b>\u00a0 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their<\/i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their<\/i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<\/p> <p>The realization of our sinful nature comes when we get in contact with God the Holy Spirit, and his different manifestations. In that sense, we are also empowered to expose sin because the Holy Spirit dwells in us and we can testify of him through our actions.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that God produces growth in us, and the works of faith that glorify Him \u201cin us\u201d serve as testimony that he lives. Let\u2019s pray that the Holy Spirit be poured over America, so people be able to experience his conviction and turn away from idolatry.<\/p> <p><b>Joh 16:8<\/b>\u00a0 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<\/p> <p>Isa 6:5\u00a0 Then said I, Woe <i>is<\/i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am<\/i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<\/p> <p>Luk 5:8\u00a0 When Simon Peter saw <i>it,<\/i> he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that we Christians devote our time reading the Word of God, so he continues the process of sanctification and purification.

We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.<\/p> <p>7 \u201cLord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame\u2014the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 8 We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, LORD, because we have sinned against you. 9 The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 10 we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. 11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 12 You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 13 Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. 14 The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.<\/p> <p>15 \u201cNow, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 16 Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem (America) and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.<\/p> <p>17 \u201cNow, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 18 Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 19 Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name. \u201d<\/p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 9):<\/b><\/p> <p>After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, \u201cThe people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. 2 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.\u201d<\/p> <p>3 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.<\/p> <p>5 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God 6 and prayed:<\/p> <p>\u201cI am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 7 From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today\u2026<\/p> <p>10 \u201cBut now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 11 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: \u2018The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.\u2019<\/p> <p>13 \u201cWhat has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 14 Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 15 LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.\u201d<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0 Pray that the Lord will rise up godly pastors (or Church leaders) who will agree to work together to preach and teach on preparing the Church, e.g., to first of all pray and fast for our nation in small and large gatherings (at work during lunch hour, at home, in parks, at church, at social gatherings, etc.) around our nation; asking the Lord to have mercy on America (as we, as Christians confess our sins of idolatry, ambivalence, etc. to Him.\u00a0 Also, these leaders should teach of the need for the Church to be actively involved in the world (to be the salt and the light of the world).\u00a0 But, everything - absolutely everything should be focused on love; the Father\u2019s agape love being shown to the world.\u00a0 \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u00a0 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\u201d (John 13:[masked])<\/p> <p>As an example of a godly leader raising the awareness of God\u2019s people to gather together in repentance, is Ezra:<\/p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 10):<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cWhile Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites\u2014men, women and children\u2014gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 2 Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, \u201cWe have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 3 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 4 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.\u201d<\/p> <p>5 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.<\/p> <p>7 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 8 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.<\/p> <p>9 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, \u201cYou have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel\u2019s guilt. 11 Now honor[a] the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.\u201d<\/p> <p>12 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: \u201cYou are right! We must do as you say. 13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 14 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.\u201d 15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.<\/p> <p>16 So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, 17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Christian-Party-of-America-NY\/events\/225794384\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Prayer For Our Nation","id":"qclpsjytnblb","time":1444350600000,"updated":1444362540000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1305604485000,"name":"Christian Party of America (NY)","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1871871,"urlname":"Christian-Party-of-America-NY","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Christian Constitutionalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"188 Madison Avenue (at 34th Street)","name":"New York Public LibrarySBIL (Science, Business & Industry) Branch","lon":-73.982971,"id":24136971,"state":"NY","lat":40.74815,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.390274018049,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444189183000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>LAST CHANCE | FREE!

Who can spare a bit of time for a good cause? They are collecting and pricing items from now until this date and then from 2pm until 6pm the day before the sale we will be setting the items out on the tables, making sure things all have prices, sorting according to type, etc. We need helping hands all during this time so come when it fits your schedule, stay an hour or as long as you can.

Ever find yourself looking across the bar and saying, \u201cHe\u2019s cute, I wonder if he\u2019s single\u201d or \u201cShe seems nice, but maybe she has a boyfriend\". Well, wonder no more! Everyone at a Click event is single and looking to meet someone. At every Click event we set up fun ice breakers to get the party going (during which you can win prizes!) You can participate or just relax and mingle at your own pace.<\/p> <p><br\/>THIS IS A MULTI-MEETUP GROUP EVENT. OVER 150 SINGLES WILL BE ATTENDING.

Having a character to fall back on gave us some sense of security later, when we faced audiences during spot improvisations. But I felt mostly that we were operating on pure guts.\u00a0<b>Guts improvising seemed less appealing a year or so later when I was introduced to Viola Spolin's improvising games. Here was a whole system that could be relied on. There was no joke making required, or even allowed, and yet the scenes that emerged were often hilarious. Rather than gags or conventional sketch comedy, what became funny was surprising human behavior. The main thing that emerges in Spolin's games is not the invention of funny stuff, but the discovery of things in you that you didn't know where there.\u00a0<\/b><\/i><i>It's true that a harder, laugh-oriented kind of performance is probably more appropriate for a cabaret show, but I think we might have benefitted from some training in Spolin's Theater Games before we set out to be consciously funny.\u00a0<b>The benefits of relating to the other player and the resulting spontaneity, I think, can be beneficial to any kind of playing. In fact, the games help in a surprising range of ways. I'm teaching Viola's games to scientists now and we're finding that after a short course in improv workshops, the scientist are able to speak about their work to audiences with far more clarity and vividness than they could before. Their increased willingness and ability to connect with the audience is remarkable.<\/b>\u00a0<\/i><i>I've always been grateful for all my improvising experience \u2014 at Compass,\u00a0<b>in Spolin-style workshops, and in experimental workshops devised by people who have devoted themselves to exploring this special world of spontaneity.<\/b>\u00a0I hope these explorations grow as more people discover the pleasures of freely entering into the group experience. Paradoxically,\u00a0<b>one pleasure of the group experience is the emergence of one's own self.\u00a0<\/b><\/i><i>Alan Alda - December 26, 2011\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alan_Alda\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alan_Alda\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alan_Alda<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/IMPROV-4-ALL\/events\/225595118\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"SPOLIN IMPROVISATION WORKSHOP","id":"zspzklytnbmb","time":1444431600000,"updated":1444494984000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1395710259000,"name":"IMPROV 4 ALL","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":13533602,"urlname":"IMPROV-4-ALL","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fellow Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"358 W 44th St","name":"Producers Club Theater","lon":-73.991478,"id":23902664,"lat":40.75959,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.668463289738,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442972725000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>STAR REALITY OPEN MIC <\/b><\/p> <p><b>@ THE ROYAL THEATRE<\/b><\/p> <p><b>THE PRODUCER'S CLUB<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/6\/3\/600_15374947.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>FRIDAY<\/b><\/p> <p><b>OCTOBER 9th<\/b><\/p> <p><b>7:00 pm SIGN UP<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$3 COVER<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/anmls\/animals-butterfly\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/anmls\/animals-butterfly<\/a><\/p> <p><b>featuring<\/b><\/p> <p><b>MATTHEW ABUELO<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SPOKEN WORD ARTIST\/ POET<\/b><\/p> <p><b> STARK REALITY OPEN MIC@ <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>ROYAL THEATRE @ THE<\/b><\/p> <p><b>THE PRODUCER'S CLUB, <\/b><\/p> <p><b>358 W. 44th St., NYC <\/b><\/p> <p><b>(between 8th and 9th ave.) \u00a0<\/b><b>NYC<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>(646)[masked] <\/b><\/p> <p><b>7:00 pm SIGN UP<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Hosted by Viviana<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/anmls\/panda\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/anmls\/panda<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/shttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/thttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/ahttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/rhttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/k\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/shttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/thttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/ahttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/rhttp:\/\/cdn-cf.aol.com\/se\/clip_art\/gstres\/alpha\/tydye\/k<\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>BRING DRUMS, GUITARS, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY!!!<br\/>WE HAVE A KEYBOARD<\/b><\/p> <p><b>!!

At Richmond Castle, courtiers discuss the state of royal affairs: Queen Anne\u2019s star is sinking since King Henry VIII has fallen in love with another woman. Jane Seymour, Anne\u2019s confidante and lady-in-waiting, appears, followed by the queen, who admits to Jane that she is troubled. Anne asks her page Smeaton to sing a song to cheer everyone. His words remind her of the happiness of her first love, which she gave up to marry the king.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/0\/d\/600_434704365.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Alone in her bedchamber, Jane\u2014who is in fact the king\u2019s new lover\u2014is conscience-stricken about her betrayal. Henry appears and passionately declares his love, promising Jane marriage and glory. She is disturbed by his threats about Anne\u2019s future but realizes that it is too late for her to turn back.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/9\/9\/600_434704505.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Anne\u2019s brother, Lord Rochefort, is surprised to meet Lord Richard Percy, the queen\u2019s former lover, in Richmond Park. Percy, who has been called back from exile by the king, has heard of Anne\u2019s distress and asks about her. Rochefort answers evasively. Percy admits that his own life has been miserable since he and Anne have been apart. The king arrives with a hunting party, followed by Anne and her ladies-in-waiting. He coolly greets his wife, then tells Percy that he has the queen to thank for his pardon. In fact, he has arranged Percy\u2019s return as a trap for Anne and is grimly amused at their emotion and embarrassment as they greet each other. He orders one of his officers to spy on the couple.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/b\/5\/600_434704533.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Smeaton, who is in love with the queen, is on his way to her apartments to return a miniature portrait of her that he had stolen. He hides when Anne appears with Rochefort, who persuades his sister to admit Percy. Percy enters and declares his continuing love. Anne admits that the king hates her, but she remains firm and pleads with Percy to find another woman worthy of his affection. Just as he draws his sword and threatens to kill himself, Henry bursts in. Smeaton proclaims the queen\u2019s innocence and in the process the furious king seizes the miniature, providing him with welcome proof of his wife\u2019s seeming infidelity. Anne, Percy, and Smeaton are arrested.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/3\/a\/600_434699450.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Act II<br\/>Anne has been imprisoned in her London apartments. Jane arrives to tell her that she can avoid execution by pleading guilty and confessing her love for Percy, thereby allowing the king to remarry. Anne refuses, cursing the woman who will be her successor. Jane admits that she is that woman. Shocked, Anne dismisses her, but then gives in to Jane\u2019s desperate pleading, insisting that it is the king, not her, who is to blame.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/1\/4\/600_434704628.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Smeaton has falsely testified to being the queen\u2019s lover, believing that his confession would save Anne\u2019s life, but in fact he has sealed her fate. Anne and Percy are brought before the council. Anne tells the king that she is ready to die but begs him to spare her the humiliation of a trial. In the following confrontation, Percy claims that he and Anne were married before she became the king\u2019s wife. Even though he thinks this is a lie, Henry triumphantly replies that another, worthier woman will ascend the throne. Percy and Anne are led away. Jane pleads with Henry for Anne\u2019s life, but he dismisses her. News arrives of the council\u2019s verdict: The royal marriage is dissolved and Anne and her accomplices are to be executed.<\/p> <p>Anne is in a state of delirium. She imagines herself on her wedding day, then recalls her girlhood love for Percy. Her fellow prisoners are brought in and Smeaton blames himself for having caused Anne\u2019s impending death. When bells and cannon fire are heard, announcing the king\u2019s new marriage, Anne suddenly comes to her senses. She furiously curses the royal couple and goes off to face her execution.<\/p> <p><b>Tickets<\/b><\/p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metopera.org\">www.metopera.org<\/a> \u00a0Then, select your seat of choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Meeting Details<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/8\/6\/600_434699526.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>We will meet halfway between the opera house and the fountain, where the grade changes from concrete to stone. \u00a0<\/b><\/i>We will also meet at intermission on the lower level (below the orchestra) lounge for drinks or tea.

Yet we live our lives being convinced of the opposite. We want things to be like this not like that. We cling to what we think is happiness and fight against what seems to threaten it. And we constantly have ups and downs, banging our head against reality again and again.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yet this is not a desperate situation. We can let go of our limited vision of things and recognize that everything in our experience is dependent on many causes and conditions and constantly changing. By learning to shift perspective, we can live a happier and healthier life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>By combining the rigor of 25 years of studies\u00a0toward a Geshe degree (the equivalent of a PhD in Tibetan Buddhism) and years of teaching Westerners, Geshe Sherab will explain in a simple way the Buddhist view of reality and how this can be very relevant for us to be happy in a demanding and challenging society.

Because they stem from misconceiving ourselves and the world around us, these painful experiences can be eliminated by progressively subduing our mind. The wisdom of emptiness is the tool the Buddha gave us to do so. It is the way to uproot our fundamental ignorance from which all our wrong views, negative emotions, and sufferings stem by realizing things as they are.\u00a0<\/p> <p>However vital the concept of emptiness is, it is difficult to grasp because it strongly differs from our usual way of apprehending ourselves and the world around us. Geshe Sherab will guide us into what emptiness means, how it differs from the way we perceive reality, and how to reflect and meditate on emptiness. He will also connect emptiness with the other Buddhist teachings, especially compassion.<\/p> <p>Geshe Sherab is well known for his notably clear explanations about emptiness, building both on his very advanced traditional studies of Buddhism as a Geshe and his experience of teaching Westerners for almost 15 years.\u00a0This teaching requires some knowledge of basic concepts of Tibetan Buddhism such as the four noble truths.<\/p> <p><b>Dates and Times:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Friday, October 9<\/p> <p>7pm - 9pm\u00a0 Public Talk\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>Saturday, October 10 and Sunday, October 11\u00a0<\/p> <p>10am - 12:30pm\u00a0 \u00a0 Morning Teachings with Tea Break<\/p> <p>12:30pm - 2pm\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lunch Break; Shantideva Meditation Center's bookstore, Bodhi Shop,\u00a0will be open.<\/p> <p>2pm - 5pm \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Afternoon Teachings and Q&amp;A with Tea Break<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>- Jewel Heart Center (For Friday's Public Talk)<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;260 West Broadway&lt;\/a&gt;, New York, NY 10013\u00a0<\/p> <p>Jewel Heart Center is located just below Canal Street.

In the past couple of months (since we discovered this place), we've covered quite a lot of ground, from regular scallion pancakes to the more intrepid ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce. \u00a0The salt baked lotus roots appetizer was really notable.<\/p> <p>Do note, though: \u00a0the menu is very authentic, so if you want something like egg rolls, this will NOT be your place to go. \u00a0(They don't even have those on the menu.) \u00a0Some of the dishes, as others stated in their reviews, can err on the salty side, but I have had plenty of dishes (the jellyfish, the hot cabbage) that haven't been salty at all.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/4\/c\/600_411106412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n*********************Tea Smoked Duck************************<\/p> <p>\n\nThe biggest challenge for me? \u00a0Convincing myself to stop midway and save the rest for lunch the next day. \u00a0Then again, I'm one of those people who always gets judged when ordering takeout, and I end up with, like, ten chopsticks and six forks for one order.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/d\/8\/600_402831672.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nOf course, Don't forget to order Chinese tsingtao Beer to go with the spicy food :)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/6\/8\/600_402835912.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/224683762\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Friday Dinner: Sichuan Food Spicy Version (DanDan+Lamb Cumin+Tea Smoked Duck)","id":"224683762","time":1444431600000,"updated":1444582027000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

Why?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac\u201d, has been in continuous publication since its first edition in 1792 by Robert B. Thomas and has been expanded beyond its original forecasts for Boston and the New England states to all of the United States. \u00a0 Its forecasts have been relied on by farmers, businesses, and governments for planning and preparing for weather conditions from the time of George Washington to the present day.\u00a0 And the Almanac boasts of an average 80% accuracy in its forecasts. \u00a0 But, how actually accurate is it?\u00a0 How are its forecasts determined? Do its publishers rely only on prior weather history, or a secret formula derived by its first publisher R. Thomas,\u00a0 or are modern meteorological methods employed? In the Almanac the contiguous states are grouped into 16 distinct weather areas and the forecasts are detailed for each area. (Alaska and Hawaii are in separate areas.) and current US Government weather studies are grouped by 30 year statistical averages, with the[masked] tabulations being the most recent. \u00a0 After analyzing the Almanac\u2019s weather forecasts for this last year their overall accuracy rate was 96.3% for the 18 regions. \u00a0 Our speaker Bill Mirabello will discuss The Almanac at the SIGS October meeting. Bill has always been interested in the weather, from dreading the snow he would shovel each winter to how soon he could plant his gardens every Spring. \u00a0 Side note: For the NYC area the first frost date is Nov 7th and the last Spring frost is April 3rd. \u00a0 Bill will discuss weather activity, what influences it \u2013 do sun spots or heavenly bodies affect the weather, Weather patterns \u2013 short term and long term, and how modern meteorologists study the weather; its trends and events. \u00a0 \u00a0 Bill earned his degree in geology in 1972, is a member of the AIPG, and first learned about weather at the knee of his father who had a career as a meteorologist\/ on-air broadcaster for the US Weather Service after serving as a meteorologist in the US Navy. \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Staten-Island-Geological-Society-Inc\/events\/225648920\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"October Meeting of Staten Island Geological Society Inc.","id":"225648920","time":1444433400000,"updated":1444444235000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1407592111000,"name":"Staten Island Geological Society Inc.","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":16281122,"urlname":"Staten-Island-Geological-Society-Inc","group_lat":40.6100006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"08840","country":"us","city":"Metuchen","address_1":"17 Oak Avenue","name":"Administration Building at St. Luke's Church - Robbins Room","lon":-74.35923,"id":14270282,"state":"NJ","lat":40.546715,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.9641284943,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420512114000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/9\/9\/600_440661913.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We invite you to join us for an\u00a0ECKANKAR Worship Service\u00a0on spirituality in everyday life. \u00a0<b>Every 2nd Friday, 7:30 - 8:30 pm<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sample Topics<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Discover the Secret of God\u2019s Love<br\/>\u2022 Accepting Spiritual Guidance<br\/>\u2022 Past Lives\u2013Have You Lived Before?<br\/>\u2022 The Amazing Toolbox of Life<br\/>\u2022 Dreams\u2014A Doorway to Heaven<br\/>\u2022 What is the Spiritual Purpose of Life?<\/p> <p><b>Everyone Welcome!<\/b><\/p> <p>The ECK Worship Service is for people of all faiths who love God.

It's nothing personal, they just don't see eye to eye. So they will blast them with their best bass and prettiest pads until the score is settled. These two are masterful and their latest on 1080p is not one to be missed, take heed.<\/p> <p>We also have a couple hitters hitting just as heavy with Solpara doing a live set and Sedan Sedan gracing the decks with their slippery selections for your deepest desires. They haven't the slightest idea how you fell into their trap, but they're glad you did. Now they have a congregation to rough up and batter until the rooster crows and the blisters won't heal back right. They never do. It is the time to be taken hostage and ride willingly with the not so well to do who'll leave you so well done. Not one you confess to will believe you. We're not worried about you naming names or telling the tale for the simple reason that the truth is so unfathomable. If you survive, If you're left alive, we will keep a piece to snack on later...<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/edm-parties\/events\/225945391\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Cultivated Sound: Techno in Bushwhick - Secret Location","id":"225945391","time":1444448700000,"updated":1444460988000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397212996000,"name":"Electronic Dance Parties Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":13853692,"urlname":"edm-parties","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Party people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443483582000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A lot of people have asked me to hold an early morning sunrise shoot.\u00a0 I spent most of the summer looking at different spots inside and out of New York City.

We have been to Hangar 3 each of last two years and it was certainly a blast! Also, it will be peak foliage season at the area.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hang gliding is an air sport in which a pilot flies a light and unmotorized foot-launchable aircraft called a hang glider (also known as Delta plane or Deltaplane). Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite-framed fabric wing. The pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe, and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame, but other devices, including modern aircraft flight control systems, may be used. In the sport's early days, pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills on low-performance hang gliders. However, modern technology gives pilots the ability to soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of miles. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and national airspace governing organizations control some aspects of hang gliding. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hang_gliding\">Learn more here...<\/a><\/p> <p>The morning will start with a safety briefing and instruction, and you will be towed in a tandem hang glider to 2,500 ft above ground with an 'USPHA' rated tandem instructor at your side, then release to fly freely like a bird and land safely on wheels.<\/p> <p>They video each flight with an on\u00a0board\u00a0camera.

We have been to Hangar 3 each of last two years and it was certainly a blast! Also, it will be peak foliage season at the area.<\/p> <p>Hang gliding is an air sport in which a pilot flies a light and unmotorized foot-launchable aircraft called a hang glider (also known as Delta plane or Deltaplane). Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite-framed fabric wing. The pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe, and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame, but other devices, including modern aircraft flight control systems, may be used. In the sport's early days, pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills on low-performance hang gliders. However, modern technology gives pilots the ability to soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of miles. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and national airspace governing organizations control some aspects of hang gliding.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hang_gliding\">Learn more here...<\/a><\/p> <p>The morning will start with a safety briefing and instruction, and you will be towed in a tandem hang glider to 2,500 ft above ground with an 'USPHA' rated tandem instructor at your side, then release to fly freely like a bird and land safely on wheels.<\/p> <p>They video each flight with an on\u00a0board\u00a0camera.

There is a tower at the summit with spectacular views and options to buy lunch. From there the group can proceed back the way we came or continue along the full traverse via Whiteface Landing to Connery Pond.\u00a0 It will be a longer day for anyone choosing to complete the Traverse and the group will be expected to move at a decent pace of at least 1 mph uphill and 2 mph on level or downhill terrain.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/e\/b\/600_442512267.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The views from Whiteface encompass all sides and include the Green Mountains of Vermont, the skyscrapers in Montreal on a very clear day, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire on an even clearer day.<\/p> <p>This Adirondack 46 High Peak is number 5 on the list.<\/p> <p>Whiteface is often times climbed with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lakeplacid.com\/do\/hiking\/esther-mountain\">Esther Mountain<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Whiteface Mountain is a unique Mountain in that it has a perfectly good access road to just below the summit. Then a short walk through a manmade passage, within the mountain, will bring you to an elevator which will deliver you to the visitor's area near the summit. But, if you want to climb it, you will need to use one of these routes below. Whiteface also has numerous slides on its slopes which would offer excellent bushwhacking and exploring options. Slides however are very dangerous and should only be done by experienced, fit hikers.<\/p> <p>You may have heard a bit about the Whiteface Ski Center, it's world renowned and still used to this day for world class competition. The ski slopes are not a route to the summit, they end quite a ways from the summit, and it is not recommended.<\/p> <p><b>Primary Trailhead:<\/b> From the intersection of Route 73 and Route 86, follow Route 86 toward Wilmington. Continue into Wilmington to the four-way stop sign. Take a left onto Route 431 (Whiteface Mountain Road). Follow here for 2.4 miles to the Atmospheric Science Research Center Road on the left. Follow this road around the one-way roundabout to the trail on the right, just past a dirt road that descends into the woods. The trail is not labeled with a DEC sign.<\/p> <p>This is a 3.9 mile hike, one way. From the trailhead you descend a bit to a very long and steep climb up Marble Mountain. The Marble Mountain section used to be an old ski slope and you will be able to see that one way \u2013 old cement footers still line the trail.<\/p> <p>From the top of Marble Mountain you will come to an intersection, left is the secondary trail outlined below. Right is the route you will want. After a short break on a flatter section you will start a demanding climb through an evergreen forest that opens up a few views along the way. After about 1.5 miles you will come to a rather large cairn at a trail intersection. This is the herd-path to Esther Mountain. Continuing straight the climb relaxes a bit after a short descent before it climbs steeply to the Whiteface Memorial Highway \u2013 trail four outlined below. During times where the road is open to vehicles it cannot be walked on. The trail leaves the roadside as soon as it hits it and climbs steeply up to an open ridge with amazing views. You will continue the ridge to the summit of Whiteface where you will be greeted in awe by all those who drove up.<\/p> <p>8-12 miles RT, depending on route, challenging climb for experienced hikers, Elevation: 4867', Ascent: 2535'<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lakeplacid.com\/do\/hiking\/whiteface-mountain\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lakeplacid.com\/do\/hiking\/whiteface-mountain\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.lakeplacid.com\/do\/hiking\/whiteface-mountain<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/0\/5\/600_442512293.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>WE WILL MEET <\/b><\/i>at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) 110 Marble Mt Rd.

I am postponing it for two reasons: hopefully we will be able to enjoy fall colors in October, and I need more time to recover from hiking it!<\/p> <p>There is a short 2.5-mile loop and at least one other point where you can turn back if you don't want to do the whole hike once you've started it, but be forewarned that this hike is around 10 miles long, and if you are taking the train back from Beacon, you have an additional 1.5 miles of city walking afterward. With frequent breaks including 20 minutes for lunch, we completed the hike in 5.5 hours, but it was difficult. The initial climb takes you up 1200 feet or so, and since the ridge is not level, you end up approaching 3000 feet of elevation changes.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/a\/600_441327322.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You can get a sense of the difficulty of the hike from the first photo above. MOST of the first 90 minutes is scrambling up steep rock faces as pictured. And frequently you need to climb up and down similar faces after that. And though none of the climbs are dangerous (the ledges are usually good sized), if you are not a careful climber, you could risk falling. And if you are afraid of heights (and I am) you will want to stay focused on where you are climbing, not turning around until you are on a sturdy ledge. And there are alternate routes on the steeper faces that take longer but ascend slower.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/2\/600_441327314.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Because we get pretty high up, and the views are often amazing.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/8\/600_441327320.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There is a fire tower near the end of the hike that has amazing views, but you can see all the way back to Manhattan even before you go that high up.<\/p> <p>For those taking the train:\u00a0 There are only two Metro North trains that stop at the trailhead, and we will plan to take the second one at 8:40 a.m. To make sure everyone has tickets and gets to the platform in time, we will meet at the GCT Info Booth at 8:15. There is a $6 per ticket discount if you buy your ticket online before you arrive at Grand Central. You will want one ticket Grand Central to Breakneck Ridge, and one Beacon to Grand Central. (If you end up changing your mind and taking a loop back to the origin trailhead, you can still use it for one of the two afternoon return trains at 4:13 or 7:17 p.m.) You need to be on the last car of the train to disembark, since it is just a whistlestop, not a station.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those driving: Since we are starting and ending at different trailheads, drivers should plan to meet at the Casino trailhead parking lot (see map) in Beacon. From there some of the cars can take hikers to the Breakneck Ridge parking areas, and then pick up cars there after the hike. I would recommend meeting at 9:45 a.m. so everyone has time to coordinate and get to the other trailhead by the time the train arrives around 10:15 a.m. Both parking lots are just off Route 9D.<\/p> <p>More than many hikes, you will want really good soles on your shoe, with good traction, thickness for hiking on rocks, and ideally hard toes to soften the blow of much potential stubbing. Though the ridge is fairly dry (we only cross one stream), you may want to pack bug spray. And because we're talking five hours of constant cardio workout, you will want a lot of water with you -- we decided a minimum of 1.5 liters was required. And when we get to the first summit, we will have lunch, and you will likely want snacks for other breaks. And much of the trail is in sunlight, so you definitely need sunscreen.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you need a rest at any point, but especially on the way up in the first 90 minutes, TAKE IT. There is no reason to force yourself to keep going when you're panting and exhausted. Try to make sure someone is within sight when you rest, so you don't get left behind. The trail is pretty well marked, but there are a lot of dead ends and washes that look like trails that will lead you astray.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thanks to Mike, John, Richard, and Joseph for helping with the test hike.<\/p> <p><br\/>For a trail map:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysparks.com\/parks\/attachments\/HudsonHighlandsNORTHHudsonHighlandsStateParkTrailMap.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nysparks.com\/parks\/attachments\/HudsonHighlandsNORTHHudsonHighlandsStateParkTrailMap.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>For a video orientation:\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/83pJynYfjLU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/83pJynYfjLU<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be wearing a red Meetup shirt and a baseball cap","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gay-Mens-Hiking-Group\/events\/224694280\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"name":"Breakneck Ridge to Beacon Hike","id":"224694280","time":1444479300000,"updated":1444612127000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340068341000,"name":"Gay Mens Hiking Group","group_lon":-74,"id":4115152,"urlname":"Gay-Mens-Hiking-Group","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":19.0593948364,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441562531000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I love this time of year.

That was an esoteric futuristic philosophy about post-humanity, technological immortality, resurrection and cosmic expansion. Early cosmists proposed the idea of decompaction (lightweighting) of the human body, that eventually wouldn\u2019t need an atmosphere and would be powered directly by solar energy. They call it \u201cradiant humanity\u201d - a perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. Modern Cosmism brings to the original doctrine the ontological foundation, a scientific structure and a deeper comprehension of possible technology aims to create in the future a new synthetic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised. The conference will review the critical question about a potential meeting with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations and suggest few hypotheses about their \u201ceerie silence\u201d. We will touch some related problems in cosmology, and astrophysics such as the shape and future of the Universe, black hole information paradox, multidimensional space, dark energy and interpretation of quantum mechanics. Are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of causality? Like no other area of philosophy and technology before, Modern Cosmism raises fundamental questions about the post human nature and how it will be connected to the reality. Is the structure of reality included the consciousness? Is a non biological hardware can support the consciousness? How we can define Cosmic Evolution and what is the role of intelligent life? The conference will address important philosophical issues that arise with the future design of artificial consciousness, mind uploading and cyber-immortality. How will our concepts of subjectivity, perception, and morality change, if we will live in virtual reality of mega-consciousness environment where individuals can experience multiple presence, personality and have no gender. Will we be able to create super intelligent agents with consciousness and feelings? What are the limits of artificial capacities or functional simulations we should create? Could we enhance our own humanity by genetically redesign our nature? Our keynote and plenary speakers are well-known international protagonists of Cosmism, Transhumanism and interdisciplinary researchers. Their lectures will discuss the most important current issues of Modern Cosmism from the point of view of philosophy, technology, ethics, robotics, psychology, and anthropology.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Society for ethical culture","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Transhumanism-Antiaging-Immortalty-Cryonics-Singularity-AI\/events\/225140075\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Modern cosmism conference on AI, mind uploading and cyber-immortality in NYC","id":"225140075","time":1444485600000,"updated":1444499175000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412480948000,"name":"Transhumanism, Anti-aging, Cryonics, Singularity, AI, H+, I+","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":17405762,"urlname":"Transhumanism-Antiaging-Immortalty-Cryonics-Singularity-AI","group_lat":40.75,"who":"posthumans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"481 8th Ave","name":"The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel","lon":-73.993263,"id":24053717,"lat":40.75246,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.241459295154,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436473728000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this 1-Day, you'll learn 7 powerful techniques to authentically engage people more effectively than ever before.

While we can support activist groups, this party should not be focused on changing the vote on a bill, but rather changing individuals who are going to change the vote on a bill.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2) A group defines itself by identifying who is part of their group and w ho is not.\u00a0 If we welcome everyone from every political party to be actively involved in defining what it is we stand for - well, we probably don't really stand for anything - have a cup of tea.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>3) The Libertarian party has embraced, or at least I believe it\u00a0embraced,\u00a0the unique political philosophy that led to the creation of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution.\u00a0[I refer to that philosophy as the Advocate Worldview.] \u00a0The Declaration of Independence could have been written by anyone of any political persuasion. However, the US Constitution could only have been formulated by people who embraced the Advocate Worldview.\u00a0They put their lives on the line to create a Libertarian (Advocate)structure for our society. What does that mean? It means a society where government reports to you, you do not report to the government; it means a government that receives funds because you want to part with them, not a government that 'taxes' them from you, where 'taxes' is equivalent to take; it means a government that does not intrude on your life; it means a government that is naturally fiscally small; it means a government that answers to those who empower government, not empower the people who answer to government.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>4) Yes, I believe we should be an exclusive club. You cannot embrace two political philosophies at the same time (and I would be willing to elaborate and demonstrate this to anyone who doubts that fact): While everyone can join the Tea Party regardless of what they believe, the Libertarian Party is suppose to be a party comprised of, and consisting of, individuals who have proudly stood up and said they support the Libertarian (Advocate) political philosophy and that they want that political philosophy exclusively used to create our laws.\u00a0 Until a person is willing to make this statement publicly, I say let them remain outside until they decide for themselves who they want to support.\u00a0Politics is not a game. It is an alternative to war, and not many people\u00a0choose to fight on all sides in a war. \u00a0[Interestingly, there were four sides in WWII. Three sides joined forces against the fourth.\u00a0There are also\u00a0four sides in politics.]\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>5) We\u00a0do a lot of complaining\u00a0about the two party system.

While we can support activist groups, this party should not be focused on changing the vote on a bill, but rather changing individuals who are going to change the vote on a bill.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2) A group defines itself by identifying who is part of their group and w ho is not.\u00a0 If we welcome everyone from every political party to be actively involved in defining what it\u00a0is\u00a0we stand for - well, we probably don't really stand for anything - have a cup of tea.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>3) The Libertarian party has embraced, or at least I believe it\u00a0embraced,\u00a0the unique political philosophy that led to the creation of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution.\u00a0[I refer to that philosophy as the Advocate Worldview.] \u00a0The Declaration of Independence could have been written by anyone of any political persuasion. However, the US Constitution could only have been formulated by people who embraced the Advocate Worldview.\u00a0They put their lives on the line to create a Libertarian (Advocate)structure for our society. What does that mean? It means a society where government reports to you, you do not report to the government; it means a government that receives funds because you want to part with them, not a government that 'taxes' them from you, where 'taxes' is equivalent to take; it means a government that does not intrude on your life; it means a government that is naturally fiscally small; it means a government that answers to those who empower government, not empower the people who answer to government.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>4) Yes, I believe we should be an exclusive club. You cannot embrace two political philosophies at the same time (and I would be willing to elaborate and demonstrate this to anyone who doubts that fact): While everyone can join the Tea Party regardless of what they believe, the Libertarian Party\u00a0is suppose\u00a0to be a party comprised\u00a0of,\u00a0and consisting of, individuals who have proudly stood up and said they support the Libertarian (Advocate) political philosophy and that they want that political philosophy exclusively used to create our laws.\u00a0 Until a person is willing to make this statement publicly, I say let them remain outside until they decide for themselves who they want to support.\u00a0Politics is not a game. It is an alternative to war, and not many people\u00a0choose to fight on all sides in a war. \u00a0[Interestingly, there were four sides in WWII. Three sides joined forces against the fourth.\u00a0There are also\u00a0four sides in politics.]\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>5) We\u00a0do a lot of complaining\u00a0about the two party system.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

It's true. Back in the day, blogging was more or less an online journal that you could either share with other people... or keep private. It's like your starting a conversation with your reader. You write, and they comment. Today, blogging platforms are more or less personal or business websites with the social aspect still available to actively engage with readers. You can use blogging for many things:<br\/>- Therapy (working through things can be easier to release when we take the time to write them down)<br\/>- Instructional (Help other people by telling them how you do what you do)<br\/>- Make money (Yes it's true, you can earn money from your blog)<\/p> <p>Mostly, I think people using blogging to let their voice be heard. Blogging is easy and everyone that wants to be part of the conversation can have a voice. You can speak without interruption and then wait for a reply. That is one of the greatest things about blogging in my opinion.... speaking without interruption. I feel like very often people don't really listen... they are sort of just waiting for their turn to talk. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest (I love Pinterest) blogging provides us with a soap box to stand on and look for like minded people. Blogging can generate revenue and blogging can also provide your with a forum to provide evidence your expertise. So, I think I'd like to host a meetup at the Parsippany Library to show you how to setup your free blogging account and get your started.<\/p> <p>Here's my intention:<br\/>-1 hour meetup (to start, if you like this we can do it again)<br\/>-We'll go over setting up your free blogging account<br\/>-learn how to create content<br\/>-learn how to modify the appearance<br\/>-learn how to share your blog (or not, your choice)<br\/>(believe me the hour will go very quickly)<\/p> <p>There are two ways we can do this, I can either book the computer room (which only has 12 computers so there's a limit to the number of members that can sign up) OR I can book a regular meeting room that will have wifi and you will all be required to bring your own laptop. (actually I can bring a few spares, but I don't have enough for everyone) When you leave after this meetup, you will have a blog started, with at least one post! Writing is one of the best ways to understand how you think about what you think about. I am always amazed at some of the things that I write when I read them later, sometimes I see how I am blocking my success by the words I use, or by the way I talk about my possibilities... and sometimes I am blown away by my insight and I thinks, \"Wow, did I really write that? That is good!\" HA HA HA HA<\/p> <p>One other thing, I have to pay to book the Library, so I will need to charge a small fee to set this up.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

We'll get some teams together and play some competitive, but relaxed bball-- and without any giant hands in our faces! :-p<\/p> <p>We rent out the gym from 5:00-8:00pm. Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later!

If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun!

With help from his team and against all odds, Petit attempts the seemingly impossible stunt on Aug. 7, 1974.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.flickeringmyth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/the-walk-poster.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cast:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0330687\/?ref_=tt_ov_st\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3114649\/?ref_=tt_ov_st\">Charlotte Le Bon<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm2968773\/?ref_=tt_ov_st\">Guillaume Baillargeon<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Director: \u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=robert+zemeckis&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LWz9U3MDSoSE5KTlPiBHPSzLMstcSyk6300zJzcsGEVUpmUWpySX4RAChduuUyAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CLcBEJsTKAEwE2oVChMIuZvIzbCxyAIVhHQ-Ch0ZqA1r\">Robert Zemeckis<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Rated:\u00a0<\/b>PG\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Running Time: \u00a0<\/b>1 hr 40 min<\/p> <p><b>Opens:\u00a0<\/b>OCTOBER 9, 2015<\/p> <p><b>Genre: <\/b>Action\/Adventure\/Drama<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4W6byFcD5uE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4W6byFcD5uE<\/a><\/p> <p><b>After the movie well meet at the lobby where we first met to go as a group to: \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/houndstooth-pub-new-york?osq=dinner+restaurant\">Houndstooth Pub<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0520 8th Ave<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0New York, NY 10018<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (212)[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Check their menu:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houndstoothpub.com&amp;src_bizid=Kmi3Fm26aRRMLpQz4cf8XQ&amp;cachebuster=1444257149&amp;s=cc395f11238db2f2a7d747ddd7b2d728423a119abfd6e3263aafec0f17aa2c7c\">houndstoothpub.com<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SEE YOU SATURDAY NIGHT!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will be waiting by the lobby, I will email you my number Saturday afternoon.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-City-Movie-adventurers-Much-more\/events\/225907114\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"\"THE WALK\" w\/ Joseph Gordon-Levitt","id":"225907114","time":1444512600000,"updated":1444696657000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1232056991000,"name":"NY City Movie Watchers & Much More ($14 all movies)","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1358965,"urlname":"NY-City-Movie-adventurers-Much-more","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Movielovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"26 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003","name":"26 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003","lon":-73.990278,"id":1528042,"state":"NY","lat":40.724419,"repinned":false},"headcount":28,"distance":1.771245718,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1306188838000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>During\u00a0weekly meetings on Saturday evenings in the East Village of New York City, Atmanivedana das (Atma) and Subhangada devi dasi (Subhie) teach how to hear and chant sanskrit names for God in kirtan\u00a0and teach a systematic study the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Kirtan meditation consists of hearing and chanting sanksrit names for God to the accompaniment of melodious and rhythmic music in order to invoke God's divine mercy and presence. \u00a0<i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> is studied according to the ancient, yet unbroken, chain of teachers, as taught originally by Krishna and eventually Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Rupa Goswami, and more recently A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation\u00a0of $10.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. \u00a0Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> by the name Krishna.<\/p> <p>Here is\u00a0the general schedule of our\u00a0meetups:\u00a0we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 Then, we\u00a0have a class on <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>, which lasts\u00a0for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the class, we will go through verses of the <i>Gita<\/i> in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. \u00a0By about 7:30, the last kirtan\u00a0begins;\u00a0it lasts for about 30 minutes. \u00a0A\u00a0sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p> <p>Admission to each meetup is free. \u00a0Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p> <p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/225818646\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"pckzrytnbnb","time":1444512600000,"updated":1444876728000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":31,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444279405000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/events\/219754221\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>Typically Alternating Hosts: George &amp; Michael Y are off this week. \u00a0Oct 10th - Yen is substituting. \u00a0(See photo for location of meetup table inside CitiCorp atrium. \u00a0Look for the me at the table with blue\/white checkered table cloth.)\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/f\/c\/600_438757884.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/1\/e\/600_438757918.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>George wrote:\u00a0<br\/>\"CitiCorp Atrium Lower Level\u00a0<br\/>153 E 53rd street (Between Lexington and 3rd ave)<\/p> <p>From 5:00pm-7:30pm (it's okay to arrive late or leave early.).

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/225536125\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":9000000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Saddhasara!","id":"cltxklytnbnb","time":1444514400000,"updated":1444528383000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Elmhurst","address_1":"86-40 56 Avenue","name":"Parivara Dhamma Acala Buddhist Temple","lon":-73.875801,"id":24075268,"state":"NY","lat":40.733528,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.09777879715,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442603138000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meditation session: 6-7 PM<\/p> <p>Q &amp; A session: 7-8 PM<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWear comfortable loose clothes.

Then, we'll have a public lecture on the search for life in the universe. Prof. Jason Kendall of WPU's Physics Department will talk about astronomers' search for life on other planets, including Mars, Titan, Enceladus and beyond! Following the talk, we'll take a walk out to the Wightman Football Field to go stargazing. You'll be able to see stars and nebulae through a telescope! If it's clear, it'll be third-quarter Moon, giving us a wonderful view of the wonders of the sky. The telescopes will be operated by Prof. Kendall's Introduction to Astronomy class. They've been working hard all semester learning the skies and and are ready to be your Star Ambassadors. In the event of a cloudy or rainy night, we'll follow the lecture with a 45-minute movie. Please also make sure to call the hotline, because the stargazing event will be changed to a movie in the event of clouds or rain. Local area amateur astronomers are invited to bring their telescopes. Kids and families are welcome.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Some of them happen to be single. And a lot of us are always complaining about how we never meet anyone decent to date. Let's get together and do what works when it comes to dating -- meeting people through friends and seeing immediately if there's chemistry.<\/p> <p>Our fantastic EWNYC members will review all the great single friends we know and invite a few of them to join us for an evening of fun. Doesn't matter who they are, there is only one criteria that they need and that's to be completely single. The great thing is that these are people whose 100% awesomeness can be vouched for -- none of us are friends with serial killers, right? It's not mandatory but you should probably be single also, you might make a connection here of your own.<\/p> <p><b>The Rules ...<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to keep the ratio of the sexes somewhat even, we do not want to discourage members from attending if they do not have a friend to come with. For example, if your friends, coworker, gym buddy and lunch mate is busy simply come. Will be your single friend<\/p> <p>There are no age restrictions regarding the friends you can bring. EWNYC has members of all ages and who are we to stand in the way of the blossoming of a May-December romance.<\/p> <p>If you would like to attend you cannot bring a friend you must come alone. Please contact the organizer. We are a friendly group and enjoy the time in this intimate setting.
