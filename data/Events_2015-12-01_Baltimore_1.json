Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/226536117\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglytpbwb","time":1447799400000,"updated":1447811310000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules brokered under this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with Aviation Velo for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

And there is free parking behind the restaurant, and a public parking area adjacent to that lot.<\/p> <p>Meetup attendees get an opportunity each month to tell us a little about themselves: where they are from; what got them interested in the veg\/vegan lifestyle; their personal interests; success stories; or a chance to get some answers to questions with regard to diet and lifestyle.<\/p> <p>And please check out the monthly <b>Earthsave Veg Dinner Series<\/b> events that are normally held on the last Saturday from 6-8 pm at Towson Presbyterian Church, 400 Chesapeake Ave in Towson. The dinners are vegan and often attract a group of 40-70 attendees. \u00a0For more information, see <a href=\"http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/earthsavebaltimore.org\/<\/a>.<\/a> Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>You may also want to check out the <b>Baltimore Vegetarian Meetup<\/b> group, which is very similar to this one, but meets on the first Sunday, at 12.30 pm, at <b>Mango Grove<\/b> in Columbia.

Readers will marvel at the sheer range of settings in which complex systems operate: from ant hills to the stock market, from T cells to Web searches, from disease epidemics to power outages, complexity challenges theorists\u2019 intellectual adroitness. With refreshing clarity, Mitchell invites nonspecialists to share in these researchers\u2019 adventures in recognizing and measuring complexity and then predicting its cascading effects. Concepts central to thermodynamics, information theory, and computer programming all come into focus in this foray into the recesses of complexity. Still, the analysis illuminates more than explanatory frameworks (such as network diagrams and genetic algorithms); piquant personalities (including Stephen Jay Gould and John von Neumann) also receive illuminating scrutiny. Though Mitchell acknowledges the doubts of skeptics, she still expresses hope that persistent complexity researchers will yet weld their disparate accomplishments into a coherent paradigm.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bowie-Bevy-of-Brainy-Books\/events\/220767924\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":3600000,"name":"\"Complexity: A Guided Tour\", Melanie Mitchell","id":"220767924","time":1447891200000,"updated":1447909517000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1356211872000,"name":"Bowie Bevy of Brainy Books","group_lon":-76.7699966431,"id":6326812,"urlname":"Bowie-Bevy-of-Brainy-Books","group_lat":38.9700012207,"who":"Science Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"10375 Little Patuxent Pkwy","name":"Columbia Central Library","lon":-76.858506,"id":751432,"state":"MD","lat":39.211595,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.8916549683,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1402324568000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Group reviews of Korean grammar structure(basic through advanced), Korean conversation, \ud55c\uc790, culture, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNote: On the <b>third Wednesday<\/b> of every month there may be a special activity instead of normal study group.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe girl on the train is Rachel, a lonely, alcoholic divorcee who rides the train to and from London each day, hoping to keep her long-suffering roommate from discovering that she\u2019s been fired from her job. The train, cruelly, passes each day by the house where she once lived with her adored ex-husband, Tom. He still lives there with the woman he left her for and their small child. Rachel directs her focus a few houses down, where another young couple lives, envying their seemingly blissful partnership. One day, she is shaken by what she sees at the couple\u2019s house -- and soon after, the wife disappears. Rachel, convinced the event she witnessed is relevant to the case, is quickly drawn into the mystery, but her debilitating alcoholism and the blackouts caused by her binges make her an unreliable witness, untrusted by the authorities and even by herself.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nRachel\u2019s narration -- which is often painful to read, as we watch her struggle through relapse after relapse and clutch desperately at memories hidden in the fog of drunken nights -- alternates with the narratives of the two other women in the story. Megan, the vanished wife, tells an earlier story, one that complicates Rachel\u2019s golden vision of her life with husband Scott. Compulsively unfaithful, guilt-ridden, and lost, Megan seems to be the flaw in the perfect family the two of them could start. Anna, Tom\u2019s new wife, is a striking contrast to the other women; vain, smug, and entitled, she misses being his fun, sexy mistress but is pleased to have won out. Her love for their child, and fear of unpredictable Rachel, adds some depth to her shallow character.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt soon becomes clear, however, that Rachel\u2019s blackouts and shoddy memory are hiding something far darker than a few irresponsible nights, and we\u2019re left to wonder who among the tenuously linked characters are safe from the secret behind her binges.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the back of the Nordstrom Marketplace Cafe.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/columbia-meetup-book-club\/events\/226249322\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"name":"November Book Club Meeting","id":"226249322","time":1447975800000,"updated":1448027217000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1193699468000,"name":"Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":783965,"urlname":"columbia-meetup-book-club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"8890 McGaw Rd #230","name":"Loyola Columbia","lon":-76.879997,"id":23832486,"state":"MD","lat":39.209999,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":150,"headcount":0,"distance":14.9994421005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446846509000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I said a hip, hop, the hippy to the hippy\/To the hip hip hop, you don't stop.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you were a fan of hip-hop\/rap at any point, you are likely familiar with \"Rapper's Delight\" by the Sugar Hill Gang.

Done incorrectly, humor can be a disaster. Executed correctly, humor lightens the load, eases the burden and releases tension. There are three basic methods for adding humor to a speech: Tell a canned joke, tell an original joke or simply make a wry observation.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Method #1: Canned Jokes<br\/>The beauty of a canned joke is that it has usually withstood the test of time. For someone just starting to add humor, this is the best technique. By telling an old standby, you can concentrate on timing and delivery \u2013 two of the major keys to being funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery:<\/b> This refers to the way you present a joke. These two ideas may be the most important aspects of humor. As Toastmasters, we know that communication is more than just words. When you deliver a joke, your attitude alone can make or break the punch line.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But you have to get over the idea that you have to be perfect. Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to laugh.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of our newer members served as Toastmaster for the first time. She opened with a joke, stumbling through it. Even though she had to read the joke and even apologized to us ahead of time for her lack of experience, she told the joke with a smile and a wink. We laughed!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Audacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears. Just say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m terrified. I might botch the punch line, I might forget the entire joke; maybe no one will laugh. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway. It will be hard this first time, but easier the next and the next and the next.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The basic keys to adding humor to your speech are:<\/p> <p>relevance, and<\/p> <p>unexpected insight<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say you were doing a talk about ESPN or sports fanatics or even just sports in general. You might try the following \u201cused\u201d joke:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cA sports-buff showed up at the sold-out football game. He took his seat on the 50-yard line and then gently placed a woman\u2019s coat and an extra ticket on the seat next to him. The spectator behind him asked, \u201cAre you saving that seat for someone?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man said, \u201cNo. It would have been for my wife, but she\u2019s passed on.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d the spectator said. Then he added, \u201cGosh, why didn\u2019t you give that extra ticket to a friend?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man turned around with a surprised look on his face and said, \u201cAll my friends are at the funeral.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This joke is obviously\u00a0<i>relevant<\/i> to a sports-oriented talk. It sets the theme of the speech and warms up the audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The <i>insight<\/i> is that we sometimes get so wrapped up in our own stuff that we forget about other people. We all do it. This guy just did it bigger and that makes it funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Try out this joke (or any other) on several friends. Practice timing the punch line. Try different wording to make it your own. Try out different pacing, pausing in various places for emphasis. Like any other skill, you learn to tell a joke by practicing. Most people who claim they don\u2019t know any jokes are simply saying that they haven\u2019t practiced any.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most canned jokes are generic and you don\u2019t have to attribute your source. However, if you are relating something specific to a certain comedian, you should give proper credit. Use your best judgment. You may want to say something like, \u201cAs Steve Martin so aptly put it: \u2018The new phone book is here! The new phone book is here!\u2019\u201d But don\u2019t start your joke with \u201cI got this off the Internet...\u201d Just launch into it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Once you become comfortable telling jokes you\u2019ve found from other sources, take your humor up a notch by trying out some original material.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Method #2: New Material<br\/>There is a basic three-point structure you can follow to create your own, original material:<\/p> <p>Come up with a topic,<\/p> <p>Add a premise, and<\/p> <p>Turn it around.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works: First, come up with a topic. For example, if you are a parent, you might want to make a joke about being a father or a mother. Here\u2019s a caveat. If you are a woman, don\u2019t choose the topic of being a father. The audience won\u2019t be able to relate through you.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cSometimes a witty observation will produce no more<br\/>than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye. That\u2019s enough.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Next, create a premise. Let\u2019s say you are making a joke about being a dad. Your premise might be that it\u2019s hard to be a dad. Or, that having kids makes men a bit stupid. Or weird. Or that having kids is scary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Comedy trainer Judy Carter uses those four specific words when she is training people to be funny. She calls them \u201cattitude\u201d words. When you are just beginning to experiment with writing your own material, it is best to stick with the basics:<\/p> <p>Algebra homework is hard.<\/p> <p>Skateboarding on the highway is stupid.<\/p> <p>Being a dad is weird.<\/p> <p>Being tall around toddlers is scary.<\/p> <p>The third part is the hard part. You have to bring in the unexpected. For instance, if you are working with \u201cskateboarding on the highway is stupid,\u201d and you were being serious, you might finish with how dangerous it is. For a joke, look for insight. Look for pain.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, let\u2019s look at a concrete example:<\/p> <p><b>Step one:<\/b> Choose a topic. Let\u2019s say you chose \u201cparenting.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step two:<\/b> Choose an attitude. For example, \u201craising kids is hard.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step three:<\/b> Create a twist. First of all, what is hard about raising kids?<\/p> <p>Maybe your answer is that you have to be more mature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, think of a way to twist that around to surprise the audience. Here is how I used this topic to open my speech on traveling.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cTraveling with kids is hard! You gotta be tough, you know?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We just got back from Disney World. We spent all day walking and it was hot and it was like, \u2018I need a drink of water, and \u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 and \u2018I need to go potty.\u2019\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, my six-year old put her hands on her hips and said, \u2018Dad, quit whining.\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery, Part II.<\/b> Practice makes perfect. Although great material always sounds like it is impromptu, it rarely is. With jokes, more than with anything else, practice is imperative. You have to practice until it sounds as if you are just making it up on the spot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Record your joke delivery and then listen. After a while, you will get a good feel for the pace. You will hear where the pauses work and where they don\u2019t. Along the way, you\u2019ll memorize the joke. It will also stop sounding funny to you. Don\u2019t worry; your audience has never heard it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In my travelogue about Florida, I tell a story about my five-year old.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cKids are wise, aren\u2019t they? My five-year old son played in the sprinklers at the park and on the ride back to our condo, he took off all his clothes. He got out of the car and everyone stared at him as he walked down the street, naked as can be. JoAnn and I were mortified, of course, but he just looked around and said, \u2018Well, at least I\u2019m wearing sun block!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This story stopped being funny to me a long time ago, but whenever I tell it, everyone guffaws.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Rule of Three<\/b><br\/>Three is an inherently funny number. Just make a list of three things. Throw out the last one and replace it with something outlandish. A word, a phrase. A dead fish.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s take the simple topic of sun block and play it out.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cSun block is weird. (notice the attitude word) My wife packs SPF 44. Sun protection factor 44. Do you know what that means? That means that we can stay out in the sun 44 times longer with it on. Where are we going anyway? The Mojave Desert? The Sahara? The planet Mercury?\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Acting Out<\/b><br\/>Take your humor up another notch...act it out. Now take your rant against sun block and play it out even further:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cHave you ever noticed that the companies that make sun block make bug repellent too? You have to have both because they make the sun block smell like Pi\u00f1a Coladas. Of course it\u2019s going to attract bugs. They\u2019re like \u2018Yeah baby! It\u2019s cocktail hour!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Surviving the Joke<\/b><br\/>If you\u2019ve practiced your jokes and bounced them off the right people ahead of time, you\u2019re sure to get some laughs. Even so, the day will come when the audience just doesn\u2019t get it. There are two ways to deal with the \u201cbomb:\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>One is the \u201csaver.\u201d Powerhouse speaker J.R. Ridinger sometimes gets going so fast and furious that he leaves the audience behind. His favorite saver: \u201cMaybe that one will catch you on the way home.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The other technique is to just keep on keeping on. One of my all-time favorite inspirational speakers once gave a sermon on sex. The funny quotes she told at the beginning left the audience speechless. She handled her choice of material like a true professional, never missing a beat, though I squirmed and turned a bit red.\u00a0<br\/>Listening to this professional also showed me how confidence and audacity can pull off a joke that a less confident person could never get away with.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Method #3: Wry Observations<br\/><i>Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.<\/i> \u2013 Mark Twain\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of the great masters of the witty statements, Mark Twain once said that electric lights were to humor as lightning was to wit. In other words, unlike a joke that has a story-line, natural wit usually comes out as a pointed, wry observation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Use the triple-A method to develop your ability to make witty statements. First, be\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ware, then add\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ttitude and\u00a0<b>A<\/b>llow yourself to grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Be aware<\/b> by understanding that humor comes from understanding shared experiences, especially painful ones. In order to fully cultivate your own sense of humor, you have to stop seeing your life as completely tragic. We all have troubles. Open your eyes and your mind and watch for the irony and the contrast in life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your attitude will help you be funny. Watch any great comedian, male or female. Some are gutsy and loud, some are meek and shy. You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Finally, allow yourself to be funny. Open your mouth and try. Toastmasters is the perfect place to nurture your inner comic. Occasionally you may tell a stinker. Get over it and try again. Progress only comes with practice in front of real people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You don\u2019t have to elicit a roar of laughter from your audience. Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye.\u00a0<\/p> <p>That\u2019s enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember that Toastmasters is a learning organization. Give yourself permission to try, and trust that your fellow members are either (a) wishing they were as brave as you and respecting you for it, (b) about in the same\u00a0<\/p> <p>place on the progress curve as you are and respecting you for it, or (c) re-living the time they first tried humor and respecting you for doing the same.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, get out there. Be yourself, be happy and be confident. Long after your listeners have forgotten the content of your speech, they will still remember how you made them feel.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Historic Oliver's Carriage house is located at 5410 Leaf Treader Way, Columbia, MD.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/events\/226261440\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters leadership and communication skills meeting.","id":"226261440","time":1447979400000,"updated":1447989542000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346087629000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4652422,"urlname":"patuxent-toastmasters","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"toasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21209","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"6080 Falls Road","address_2":"in the back","lon":-76.650403,"phone":"410-377-4800","name":"BYV, Mt.

As the heart grows, so does the love, and so does our ability to experience lasting happiness in all areas of our lives.\u201d Mehrdad Mizani<\/p> <p>To see a sample of Mehrdad's talk, go to the following links:<a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/<\/a><\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Below Mehrdad on Jordan Rich show....delightful<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Way-of-Heart\/events\/225969935\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Who is in Charge of My Life? ~ Talk & Discussion ~ Potluck Dinner","id":"dbfvpgytpbbc","time":1448064000000,"updated":1448331667000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1343498654000,"name":"The Way of Heart ~ Life, Relationships, Music, Food & More!","group_lon":-77.0100021362,"id":4413292,"urlname":"The-Way-of-Heart","group_lat":39.0200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"740 Route 3","name":"Athletic Performance Inc","lon":-76.663811,"id":11010062,"state":"MD","lat":39.051575,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.6738166809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447997606000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Special drop in at API on Friday on the turf field (no cleats).<br\/>The cost is $5 to play from 7 - 9pm.<br\/>Come and join us and find a team to join in our Friday night league.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Annapolis-Soccer-Enthusiasts\/events\/226903208\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Friday Drop On soccer at API on Turf field","id":"226903208","time":1448064000000,"updated":1448072966000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1271001655000,"name":"Annapolis Soccer Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":1628848,"urlname":"Annapolis-Soccer-Enthusiasts","group_lat":39,"who":"Soccer Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":20.1481266022,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447337989000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Ladies,<br\/>As we all know scripture is important to meditate on daily and commit to memory.

Almost all of the trail is asphalt surfaced, however, wooden boardwalks were used in environmentally sensitive areas to protect natural features.

Dixon, Jr. aircraft observation area where there is a tot-lot, bike racks, and rest rooms.

The trail continues up the west side of Rt. 170 and completes the loop around the airport to the west and north.

Berg\u2019s score employs the twelve-tone technique pioneered by his teacher Arnold Schoenberg but in a keenly dramatic way that makes it accessible to all kinds of audiences. Berg died before completing Act III of the opera, and Lulu was first performed as a fragment.

Forced to discover what she can about her stolen former life, she must at the same time learn who wanted-and still wants-to destroy her and those she cares for and how she can save herself. \"Fledgling is a captivating novel that tests the limits of \"otherness\" and questions what it means to be truly human.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\".

However, riding weather is not fully predictable so we need to set some expectations for what is \"reasonable.\"<\/p> <p>Weather forecasts more than 4 days ahead of a ride are only a guide to what may come. As the date of the ride gets closer the forecast becomes more accurate but then needs to be read in detail to decide if you will participate. 50% probability of rain looks pretty bad at first glance but what about 50% probability of .1\" ending at 5am on ride day? The day's forecast will continue to show 50% probability and many riders will stay home on a great riding day.<\/p> <p>I generally use 30% probability forecast at the time of the ride as acceptable, especially if the amount is measured in tenths of an inch. Looking at an online weather map set in motion will also tell us if we're going to be in the middle of something ugly or just skirting the edges. If a ride encounters rain, we take whatever steps are necessary to ensure a safe, comfortable ride including delayed start, shelter for a while, modified route or even last minute cancellation in the worst case. With a 30% probability of rain forecast, I have only had 1 of about 15 rides get rained on and that was intermittent.<\/p> <p>[b]I prefer that if you want to participate in a ride, RSVP without consideration for the weather [\/b]but include a note indicating your intent to stay home if it rains.

However, riding weather is not fully predictable so we need to set some expectations for what is \"reasonable.\"<\/p> <p>Weather forecasts more than 4 days ahead of a ride are only a guide to what may come. As the date of the ride gets closer the forecast becomes more accurate but then needs to be read in detail to decide if you will participate. 50% probability of rain looks pretty bad at first glance but what about 50% probability of .1\" ending at 5am on ride day? The day's forecast will continue to show 50% probability and many riders will stay home on a great riding day.<\/p> <p>I generally use 30% probability forecast at the time of the ride as acceptable, especially if the amount is measured in tenths of an inch. Looking at an online weather map set in motion will also tell us if we're going to be in the middle of something ugly or just skirting the edges. If a ride encounters rain, we take whatever steps are necessary to ensure a safe, comfortable ride including delayed start, shelter for a while, modified route or even last minute cancellation in the worst case. With a 30% probability of rain forecast, I have only had 1 of about 15 rides get rained on and that was intermittent.<\/p> <p>[b]I prefer that if you want to participate in a ride, RSVP without consideration for the weather [\/b]but include a note indicating your intent to stay home if it rains. [b]This tells me that there is group interest in the ride and you can update your RSVP anytime. Otherwise, I get the impression that there isn't any interest in the ride and accordingly may never schedule that ride again.[\/b]<\/p> <p>Bottom line, communicate. [b]Let me know what you're thinking and be sure to have an accurate RSVP by ride day since I may ride an hour to the start point only to find myself the only one there.[\/b]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WomenOn2-3\/events\/226962662\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Ferris Mystery RIDE - Short n Sweet","id":"226962662","time":1448379000000,"updated":1448399538000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1361744421000,"name":"Women On Two & Three","group_lon":-76.4100036621,"id":7328372,"urlname":"WomenOn2-3","group_lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Lady Riders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21230","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","phone":"410-367-6903","address_1":"5700 Newbury St","name":"Mt.

An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time.

We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>The Chart House has a nice happy hour menu and drink specials from 4:30-7:00 pm. The bar area is open seating, so look for us or find a good spot where you can see Spa Creek through the huge windows.<\/p> <p>I'll be at the Chart House starting around 5:00 pm.\u00a0I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Full details below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chart-house.com\/locations\/annapolis\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chart-house.com\/locations\/annapolis\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.chart-house.com\/locations\/annapolis\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/a\/d\/600_434889133.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/e\/b\/600_443422507.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/f\/b\/a\/600_437680890.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for Jake's neon white hair in the bar area","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People\/events\/226295188\/","yes_rsvp_count":32,"name":"Happy Hour at the Chart House on Spa Creek","id":"226295188","time":1448402400000,"updated":1448464921000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326056943000,"name":"Second Half Rally - Active FUN!","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":3068792,"urlname":"Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People","group_lat":39,"who":"Fun People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cockeysville","address_1":"10854 York Road","name":"Alternate Worlds - NEW LOCATION!!!","lon":-76.644447,"id":23711471,"state":"MD","lat":39.482494,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":13.3910779953,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447818553000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We fear not the armies.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended.

Hope to attend another informative session :)\u201d<\/p> <p>Learn to improve your photography through a gentle and honest interactive online photo critique led by two seasoned professional photographers. The very best way to take your photography to the next level is to get personal feedback. These critiques are a great place to feel safe, talk about your work and get constructive feedback from two seasoned professional photographers, <a href=\"http:\/\/lorenphotos.com\">Loren Fisher <\/a>and <a href=\"http:\/\/vickielewis.com\">Vickie Lewis<\/a>. Loren has been a professional photographer and photo editor since 1978. He is an adjunct professor at Rutgers University and sells his works at art shows and festivals throughout the East Coast. Vickie has been a full-time professional photographer and editor for over 30 years and has shot over 150 portraits for People Magazine. Her work is represented by The National Geographic image collection. Both Loren and Vickie love working with photographers of all levels and conduct workshops across the country.<\/p> <p>To assure personal attention during the critiques, we are going to limit the number of photographers being critiqued to six. Photographers being critiqued will be able to interact with both Vickie and Loren and get their questions answered. We\u2019ve been doing critiques for a long time and realize that just listening can be educational too and so we are inviting all our Meetup group members to view the critiques for free.<\/p> <p>The first six photographers who sign up to be critiqued will send 8-10 photos via email. Send your best, a recent shoot or something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. Due to time limitations, we probably won\u2019t critiqued all the photos each photographer submits, but we like to have a selection to look at to help you improve. We will make sure those who choose to participate get personal attention.<\/p> <p>It doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something!<\/p> <p>If you\u2019d like to have your photos critiqued, the price is $25 per person.

And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

Here\u2019s your chance to learn how, when, and why folks make this delicious Autumn time beverage that is not only medicinal, but thoroughly local and of ecological sense. We\u2019ll start the morning digging these potent roots in a beautiful orchard meadow in Parkton, then together clean, process, and slow roast the roots at the home of our host in Cockeysville. During the roasting, folks will have the opportunity to make a bitter root tincture of dandelion, chicory, or yellow dock to take home to macerate, and to learn in greater depth about the history and current uses of these common medicinal plants. Once our roots are complete, we\u2019ll brew a fresh pot of our dark concoction to taste, and participants will each go home with a portion of the finished dried product to enjoy and boast about at home.<\/p> <p>This workshop is entirely hands on and not for the weary!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\".
