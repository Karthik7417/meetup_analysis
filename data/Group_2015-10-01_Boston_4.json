I created my first Meetup Group when I was living in Germany and it was a lot of fun. Here's an idea of how the setup has worked in the past:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. The group practices speaking a language for 30 minutes and then switches. Usually the group will naturally break down into 3-4 smaller groups practicing whatever languages they choose. <br>2. You may also practice your language of choice for the entire session if you find someone who also wishes to practice that language. <br>3. If we all wish to practice one language, e.g. French, we can speak French the entire time!<\/p>\n<p>Join the group to meet cool new people, learn about their cultures and stories, discuss interesting topics, and to progress in your comprehension and speaking in different languages. All levels are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>This group is FREE!

That's are school motto. And the most important reason to join us. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms is a Boston-based school that studies and trains Historical European Martial Arts. We teach two styles: the Longsword tradition of Johannes Lichtenauer and the Scottish tradition Broadsword and Smallsword. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers are motivated towards a demanding physical and intellectual goal. It is not simply enough to improve athletically - the study of historical arts requires a commitment to documents written hundreds of years ago, frequently in another language. In short: we are nerds.<\/p>\n<p>And fencing is a thinking sport; there are tactics and strategy to go along with the history.<\/p>\n<p>Many Historical fencers are fans of science fiction or fantasy literature. Many of us are gamers. Now we have a physical activity which links our other passions into one awesome life. And introduces us to other members of the same community.<\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers show up with a wide variety of backgrounds and skills in physical activities. And wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some are former modern fencers or kendoka. Others have never before found a sport they liked. The classes are small and always tailored to make sure everyone can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>You should join Athena School of Arms because you want to fight with swords. And to become more fit. And to learn about healthy exercise for life. And for an intellectually challenging activity. And to hit people with swords.<\/p>\n<p>A typical class is 75 minutes long. We start with 30 minutes of physical preparation. A warm-up is followed by work on either agility or speed. Then we have a Power and Core circuit.<\/p>\n<p>Then we have the actual sword curriculum. Every class starts with footwork. Attacks and defenses are developed. Progressively more protective gear and higher intensity are introduced to move towards understanding the historical fight.<\/p>\n<p>We also regularly engage in free play and have monthly, friendly class tournaments. And these are followed by all going out to dinner together. <br><\/p>\n<p>It is amazing to see some of the friendships developed within the school. Most of us were invited to the weddings of 3 different members. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms also works to reconstruct the Dagger, Sword and Buckler, and Grappling arts. Training includes free play, drills, test cutting, and physical fitness; together, these elements help students to understand and recreate combat on the battlefield, the list, and in personal defense. <br><\/p>\n<p>Starting in the 14th century the people who trained in the use of the sword started to write down the instruction they received in the art of fencing. Our group, and groups like ours from all over the world, work to reconstruct the Historical European Martial Arts. And they are martial arts. What we do is not choreographed and we use realistic weapon simulators. We put on appropriate, modern protective gear and fence at high-intensity.<\/p>","lon":-71.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/2\/highres_441133138.jpeg","photo_id":441133138,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/2\/600_441133138.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_441133138.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":191629394,"name":"Steven Hirsch"},"members":32,"name":"Athena School of Arms - Historical Swordsmanship","id":18855357,"state":"MA","urlname":"Athena-School-of-Arms-Historical-Swordsmanship","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Athenian Historical Fencers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440205714000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"geek","name":"Geek Culture","id":10493},{"urlkey":"roleplaying-games-rpgs","name":"Roleplaying Games (RPGs)","id":16425},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"console-gaming","name":"Console Gaming","id":28643},{"urlkey":"online-dating","name":"Online Dating","id":40347}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Video-Gamers-looking-for-love\/","rating":0,"description":"We are looking for video gamers who are interested in meeting other video gamers!

Apache Flink is a community-driven open source framework for scalable stream and batch processing of Big Data. Apache Flink provides an execution engine, several APIs in Java and Scala and domain-specific libraries for Machine learning and large scale graph processing (Gelly).

All are welcome, from software engineers, devops, marketing, and general business professionals.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":188632790,"name":"David Alves"},"members":15,"name":"Boston APM & Digital Experience Optimization Meetup","id":18882487,"state":"MA","urlname":"apm-dxo","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440979568000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"cinema-and-discussion","name":"Cinema and Discussion","id":28583},{"urlkey":"movies-in-movie-theaters","name":"Movies in Movie Theaters","id":43390},{"urlkey":"movies-and-movie-watching","name":"Movies and Movie Watching","id":280301}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Singles-Movie-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for people who want to watch new movies but don't want to go by themselves.

These are wonderful, sudden shifts in one\u2019s reality where we break out of the content of us and become the context in which the content of our lives arises. Awakening can temporarily break us out of our identification with our body, mind and personality, providing us a witnessing presence that is free. But this awakening will not last unless one understands what one has awakened to.\n\nYou Cannot Teach Awakening\n\nYou cannot teach someone how to awaken. You cannot teach someone who is currently asleep how to awake up. This is because they will convert everything they experience or hear into something consistent with their sleeping consciousness i.e. a better version of sleep. Awakening in itself is not a path. There is not a technique for awakening.  It is a symptom of a process, mostly hidden from us, a rare combination of factors, most of which we cannot control.\n\nSomething other than what is available to our current sleeping consciousness is needed to awaken it. It is ignorance of our true nature that keeps us asleep. This ignorance thinks it is awaken even when asleep. This ignorance not only binds us but defines who we are and what is possible, having us believe that our sleeping state is real. Dreaming of being awake does not awaken us.\n\nIt is the arrogance of our modern, ignorant intellect that imagines it can teach awakening or know or control the forces that keep people asleep and\/or allow awakening to happen. We do not control these any more than we can control chance or accident. Yet if awakening is an accident, then there may be something that can make us accident prone. Understanding this is a start.\n\nThe Purpose of Awakening\n\nThis Creation has a purpose and spiritual awakening is an expression of this purpose. Thus, it is a stage of a process, a symptom of an expression of an Original Intent that brought this Creation into existence. As a seed planted in the ground carries inherent in it the fruit, so too does awakening carry within it the purpose of its existence. Awakening is the beginning of a process, not the end. It is the next stage in the emerging potentiality that lies inherent in every living being.\n\nThe Greater Awakening\n\nAn individual awakening is not an isolated event. It is a reflection of a larger, collective awakening; a shift in consciousness that is currently happening on the planet. There is now an opportunity for mankind that has never existed before. Thus, the individual awakenings that have been occurring since the 1960\u2019s are like spring after a long dormant winter, an emerging of a new possibility for consciousness, the likes of which has never existed before.\n\nA Path to Awakening\n\nIn my experience most people awakening comes progressively. It slips up on them without them knowing it, until one day they realize they are awake. This preparation is Yoga. Yoga is conscious turning of our attention and effort to that which we do not yet know, but sense deep within ourselves. Yoga is a process by which we apply discrimination and effort to break the hold of our limited, individual reality to that which is greater. Yoga is the effort, the action, we apply to awaken and eventually to merge with that which is greater than oneself.\n\nIn this way we gain the strength and authority that gives us the resolve, the commitment and endurance to turn to the universal forces that will initiate a transformation process that will convert what is left in us into a vehicle for Divine manifestation.\n\nAwakening is the Beginning not the End\n\nAwakening has a purpose. It is for each awakened person to awaken further. There is a greater awakening, an awakening to the universal reality that lives within, be that God, Truth or the Absolute. The witnessing presence that comes from awakening is weak at first because it is still limited by the unquestioned assumptions that are still hidden. The more we attend to that which is not awakened in us the more we gather the capacity to break free of these. The witnessing presence gathers a self-reliant authority and with it the resolve needed to awaken fully to this possibility. Next is to turn to the universal reality that is all about us. To reach out and up out of our limited perspective as human beings into a cosmic state of being.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":143418152,"name":"laura"},"members":45,"name":"Boston Enlightenment Meetup","id":18883882,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Enlightenment-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brookline","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441023693000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"support-group-stop-smoking","name":"Support Group: Stop Smoking","id":28956},{"urlkey":"stop-smoking-support-group","name":"Stop Smoking Support Group","id":28957},{"urlkey":"stop-smoking","name":"Stop Smoking","id":31406},{"urlkey":"nicotine-addiction","name":"Nicotine Addiction","id":51713},{"urlkey":"stop-nicotine-use","name":"Stop Nicotine Use","id":62779},{"urlkey":"smoking-cessation","name":"Smoking Cessation","id":62780},{"urlkey":"healthier-alternative-to-tobacco","name":"Healthier Alternative to Tobacco","id":82074},{"urlkey":"quit-smoking-support","name":"Quit Smoking Support","id":397972}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brookline-Quit-Smoking-Support-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people who are seriously preparing, in the process, or have quit smoking but need person to person support.

The group requires commitment, confidentiality, willingness to both give and receive advice and ideas, and support each other with total honesty, respect and compassion.

While your group can vote to bring in guest speakers and teachers occasionally, the main focus of a mastermind group is the brainstorming and accountability support among the group members. It's not group coaching. Mastermind groups are about the MEMBERS sharing with each other, not about the Facilitator coaching individuals in a group setting. You get everyone's feedback, advice and support. Yes, if the Facilitator is an expert on the topic, by all means chime in. But keep the conversation balanced between all members. It's not a networking group. While you may share leads and resources with each other, it is not the main focus of the meetings. However, through your connections with other members, you will find plenty of joint venture opportunities, lead sharing, and professional networking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Napoleon Hill's Definition&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The concept of the \"mastermind alliance\" was formally introduced by Napoleon Hill in his timeless classic, \"Think And Grow Rich,\" though mastermind groups have been around since the beginning of time. Even Benjamin Franklin belonged to such a group, which he called a Junto. Napoleon Hill wrote about the mastermind group principle as: \"The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.\" He continues\u2026 \"No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind [the master mind].\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What You'll Get From Belonging to a Mastermind Group&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In a mastermind group, the agenda belongs to the group and each person's participation and commitment is key. Your mastermind partners give you feedback, help you brainstorm new possibilities, and set up accountability structures that keep you focused and on track. You create a community of supportive colleagues who brainstorm together to move the members to new heights. You'll gain tremendous insights which improve your business and personal life.

My goal for starting this group is to have an occasional meetup where we can share our ideas for making change, our resources, our successes, and to provide support as we go through our metamorphoses.","lon":-71.1299972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":22232171,"name":"Kris"},"members":24,"name":"Boston Area Metamorphs (Career Change)","id":18901814,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Area-Metamorphs-Career-Change","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Metamorphs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brighton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441492860000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"fitness-for-beginners","name":"Fitness for Beginners","id":79170},{"urlkey":"women-motivating-women","name":"Women Motivating Women","id":85459}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brighton-Fitness-Friends\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>This group is for females looking for a supportive local fitness group for beginners.

You may even modify your life to accommodate these expectations, leaving you unhappy, unchallenged, angry, apathetic, anxious, unfulfilled, and in a suspended emotional crisis in this lifetime.

This is for those who believe in ending the New Jim Crow. &nbsp; <br> <br>This is also a group dedicated to statistical based arguments rather than hyperbole or sensationalism. <br> <br>Yes, heroin and methamphetamine are dangerous and very addictive drugs, but the drug war against them and other drugs cause way more social harms than the drugs themselves. We can look to progressive cities, states, countries such as Vancouver B.C., Colorado, Washington, and Portugal for inspiration. Decriminalization of cannabis and even cocaine and heroin is not enough as that leaves the black market in place which still allows for unrestricted access to minors, predatory drug sales, violence, reduced but still continued mass incarceration of minorities (due to racial profiling and imprisonment of disadvantaged minorities who join the drug game but get caught at a higher rate than their peers who are not minorities), animosity towards police in urban communities, ruined lives due to childhood errors in judgement and lack of opportunity (due to a criminal record for those youth who sell drugs and are caught), etc. <br> <br>We will start by organizing activities to gather signatures for the 4 ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana as well as to register citizens to vote at various locations throughout Massachusetts (signature collection and voter registration tables at grocery stores, at concerts, etc.). I need help from those who are like minded and who are interested in voter registration and drug policy reform and activism. <br> <br>If you are new to this topic, books to consider reading would be The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society by Carl Hart, Our Right To Drugs: The Case for a Free Market Paperback by Thomas Szasz, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs Hardcover by Johann Hari, Saying Yes by Jacob Sullum, and&nbsp;http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/09\/14\/440327585\/ta-nehisi-coates-outlines-path-to-mass-incarceration-in-the-atlantic<br> <br>Another idea would be to have some book club meetings to read some of the above books as well as others that are of interest to the members of this meetup.

There will also be time for sharing, discussion and journaling after each meditation to deepen your experience and learning, and to socialize at the end. You're encouraged to bring a journal or notebook and pen.<\/p>\n<p>We practice meditation not to get better at meditating; rather, to get better at living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy. We meditate to connect to our best self and all the inner resources and wisdom available to us, and, of course, to experience the deeply relaxed, pleasurable states that arise with it.<\/p>\n<p>You can bring your own spirituality to your meditations. The paradigm I will offer through the meditations and our discussions is based on the premise that we are all one energy and non-physical Spirit consciousness in individual physical forms and personalities to create and expand from those uniquely created human desires. Therefore, from this source energy\/Spirit we have the ability to easily and joyfully create the life and experiences we desire.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe it\u2019s time for us to awaken to the fullness of who we are as Spiritual beings, to evolve, and to become more and more competent with our innate abilities for creating what we really want: peace, harmony, joy, happiness, fulfillment, love, abundance, freedom, etc. I believe we are here to live a happy, harmonious and successful life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Each time we gather, we'll have a different theme to help build and reinforce positive thinking patterns, beliefs and inner narratives that will support you in living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, we'll have 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between to help you carry the positive feelings and lessons experienced into your day and life.<\/p>\n<p>This is a perfect time to let go of stress and \"busy-ness\", and to fully let go and relax into bliss. Regardless of the intentions you arrive with, they always seem to be magically satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to have a strong community; so I hope you'll participate regularly and stay in touch by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving my e-mails .

I have access to private property in Topsfield from which point I am able to stargaze through my 12\" reflector telescope. I am offering up this opportunity to the general public to join me, on occasion. Before you consider requesting the opportunity to join this meet-up, however, please be aware of the following key points. <br><\/p>\n<p>1) The program is open only to those who have not stargazed with me before. <br><\/p>\n<p> 2) These events will be offered, at most, a couple of times each month. Each star party event will consist of about ten people. As a result, I am going to purposefully limit the size of the group (e.g., 30 people, maybe fewer) in order that everyone can have a fair chance of participating over the next six months. So I apologize in advance, but I simply cannot take in everyone who wishes to become involved with this group. It just is not logistically possible. <br><\/p>\n<p>3) Therefore, please only apply if you truly desire to participate. <br><\/p>\n<p>4) Membership approval will require a clear photo of yourself; not a picture of you from behind, or a flower, a sunset, your foot, etc. No exceptions. I do this for security reasons, as we necessarily are meeting in the dark. It is the proper thing to do, especially for the sake of the women in the group, to know who it is that is participating. <br><\/p>\n<p>5) We will meet at dusk, while there is still sufficient ambient light, in order to be properly introduced, again especially for the benefit of the women in the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>6) There are no fees associated with the meetup events. <br><\/p>\n<p>7) You are not required to have any knowledge of astronomy, nor are you required to own a telescope. If you do own a telescope, you are certainly welcome to bring it along. <br><\/p>\n<p>8) I am going to wait until the end of October before starting to add people to the group. The first event is scheduled for November 7. So I am in no rush to instantiate this group, and only if there is a sufficient level of interest to make it worth my effort. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your interest in the North Shore Stargazers. <br><\/p>","lon":-70.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/highres_442346102.jpeg","photo_id":442346102,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/600_442346102.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/thumb_442346102.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193230585,"name":"Gary"},"members":1,"name":"North Shore Stargazers","id":18967224,"state":"MA","urlname":"North_Shore_Stargazer_Group","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.6399993896,"who":"Stargazers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443218500000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"single-and-dating-again","name":"Single and Dating Again","id":30376},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pheromone-Mixer\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Use your primitive brain to find a mate at our Pheromone Mixer.
