Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m.<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"When facing the front of the building, enter at the entrance on the right side of the building.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/events\/224583223\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Insight Meditation Class (Class Canceled - School Closed)","id":"cjtwjlyvfbnc","time":1459380600000,"updated":1459387643000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334625474000,"name":"Columbia Insight Meditation Group","group_lon":-76.8700027466,"id":3684172,"urlname":"Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":1632,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":32,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
