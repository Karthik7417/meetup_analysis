The cultures and economies of the fashion industry and the city of New York have been and continue to be intertwined. The cultural economic impact of the fashion industry on New York City cannot be overstated. New York City\u2019s fashion industry employs 180,000 people and accounts for 6% of the city workforce, generating $10.9 billion a year in total wages, and tax revenues of $2 billion. An estimated 900 fashion companies are headquartered in the city. New York Fashion Week contributes about $850 million a year to the local economy\u2014about twice the economic impact of the 2014 Super Bowl.<\/p> <p>Fashion is more than ever part of a wider landscape that intersects with other creative industries (media, visual arts, design, film, craft). Fashion, its manufacturing and culture industry, and its complex media apparatus have contributed to the transformation and histories of several world cities. In many cases, as in New York City, women and immigrants were largely responsible for building the garment industry; and it was their work that intersected with social reforms, political activism, gradual urban transformation and processes of globalization and gentrification.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSome of the questions the conference will address are:<\/p> <p>How and why does a city become a Global Fashion Capital?<br\/>What role do the social media and the post-digital experience of today play?<br\/>How can labor, craft and design survive in the era of Instagram?<br\/>How do new technologies and big data affect our ways of life, thinking and consuming the city in the city?<br\/>Is there a new rhythm analysis that needs to be understood?<br\/>And how can we strengthen our right to the city and allow a new humanitarian sensibility and politics?<\/p> <p>This one-day symposium is presented by Fashion Studies at The Graduate Center and the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies, in collaboration with the School of Visual, Media &amp; Performing Arts at Brooklyn College and The Museum at FIT, and the support of Women\u2019s Studies Certificate Program, the Master in Women\u2019s Studies, The Committee on Globalization and Social Change, Data &amp; Society, and The Futures Initiative.<\/p> <p>A still from D.W.

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNewYork staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNewYork staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnewyork.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/225990411\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Tuesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"225990411","time":1444770000000,"updated":1444781631000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"22 Linden Blvd","name":"Flatbush Branch Library","lon":-73.958366,"id":21188852,"lat":40.652184,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":6.97293043137,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442144540000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out to the crochet circle.\u00a0 Many of you have requested that I meet up after work.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:<\/p> <p>Who is MaKey MaKey For?<\/p> <p>Artists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone.<\/p> <p>How Does it Work?<\/p> <p>Alligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and a banana.<\/p> <p>When you touch the banana, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.<\/p> <p>Make + Key = MaKey MaKey!<\/p> <p>What materials work with MaKey Makey?<\/p> <p>Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:<\/p> <p>Other materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more\u2026<\/p> <p>Why Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?<\/p> <p>We believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.<\/p> <p>We are inspired by the Maker Movement.

An example of 3 hours of deep testing\"<\/i><\/p> <p>Too often in talks about testing there is very little talk about testing. That's because it's not easy to talk about it. The true nature of testing is hard to speak. Many people feel as if it's so artful or mysterious that it's pointless to discuss details. I say nay. I say we can talk about it... but it takes practice to get good at it. In this talk I will get more practice talking about the fine details of deep testing, and you will be the judge of how obscure and mysterious it is.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The substance of the testing I did was three hours carefully analyzing the accuracy of a particular kind of chart. I used mathematics and tools in reasonable ways to fulfill my mission. This culminated in two conclusions: 1) the chart is accurate enough. 2) well, I'm a little embarrassed about my second conclusion, so you will have to come and see what it is for yourself.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>James Bach<\/b>\u00a0is a consulting software tester and author of Lessons Learned in Software Testing, as well as Secrets of a Buccaneer-Scholar.

As a matter of fact, an early college career assessment test had Joe pegged as a Tug Boat Operator!<\/p> <p>Born in upstate NY, he's the \u201cmiddle boy\u201d of six kids. His sister gave him this title because she was the only girl with five brothers.<\/p> <p>Joe fell down the cellar stairs at the age of at two, earning him a few stitches. When he was nine years old, he accidentally set himself on fire with diesel fuel! Challenged by school, he failed second grade and was branded \u201cmath challenged\u201d in high school. There, he was not only sentenced to remedial math classes, but also forced to quit his favorite sports of soccer and wrestling because he was bullied.<\/p> <p>Joe\u2019s high energy and love for physical activity fit well when he discovered bodybuilding. This not only increased his muscle mass, but was also the beginning of the long path to grow his self-esteem. Even though bodybuilding, coupled with his love for the outdoors, was a great outlet for his enormous passion and energy, these outlets alone couldn't satisfy his intellectual hunger. His restless curiosity was searching for something to grab onto, and college was a natural fit.<\/p> <p>Through a suggestion from a co-worker, Joe went back to school to pursue his second degree, Engineering. Texas A&amp;M was the beginning of a journey that, on the surface seemed to be bright, but was almost ending before it was to begin. Even though Joe had almost an insatiable curiosity to learn, college was not easy for him. After his first semester he was failing out! He was faced with a very important crossroad in life. Most of us give up when life seems to be heading in the wrong direction, Joe chose differently, he chose to stay in college and dig deep!<\/p> <p>___________________________________________________<\/p> <p>Every month, The New York \u00a0Power Team features a special guest speaker delivering content on a variety of topics of interest to high performers like you.

Many of these breakthroughs will be in the realm of democratized energy \u00a0- the ability to collect, store, and sell energy from your own private property. In addition, the IoT is going to bring more ubiquitous and sensitive sensors which can monitor and optimize our energy usage on a minute-by-minute basis.<\/p> <p><b>The New Market For Energy<\/b><\/p> <p>Solar power currently has the most direct connection to the idea of energy democratization, due to its low cost and relative material abundance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>With the efficiencies of solar and other energy collection \u00a0and storage methods increasing, we're going to start seeing energy surpluses in private homes. The ability to sell that energy to your neighbors or to your city is going to become a reality very quickly.<\/p> <p><b>Sensors and IoT<\/b><\/p> <p>An increasing number of sensors and apps that measure our daily activities, from our exercise to our productivity, is going to begin to be applied to energy.<\/p> <p>A smart energy grid will be able to route the right amount of energy, at the right price, at the right time, to your home. In addition to that, you'll begin to have more visibility over how much energy you're using and how to save money and save the environment through greater energy awareness.<\/p> <p><b>This Think Tank<\/b><\/p> <p>All of these breakthroughs are right around the corner, and it's up to the entrepreneur and researcher to push these breakthroughs to the larger markets.<\/p> <p>At this Think Tank we'll begin to look at the current concept of a real smart energy grid. We'll brainstorm various applications of these grids, as well as the various types of systems and products that can be built ontop of them.<\/p> <p>This will be a really in-depth discussion - lots to talk about on this topic!

John Brooks\u2019s insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history repeats itself.<\/p> <p>\n\nFive additional stories on equally fascinating subjects round out this wonderful collection that will both entertain and inform readers . . .\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Business Adventures<\/i>\u00a0is truly financial journalism at its liveliest and best.<\/p> <p>Best,<br\/>Henry<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Artisan-to-Entrepreneur-Book-Club\/events\/225370667\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"October Book Club: Business Adventures","id":"225370667","time":1444777200000,"updated":1444789816000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355769088000,"name":"Small Business Book Club NYC","group_lon":-74,"id":6273132,"urlname":"Artisan-to-Entrepreneur-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Business Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York ","phone":"914.263.8484","address_1":"123 East 15 Street","name":"The International Seafarers House ","lon":-73.988091,"id":1196557,"state":"NY","lat":40.734631,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":1.06890845299,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444446243000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You're invited to join us for this weekly opportunity to sharpen your drawing skills!\u00a0This session is open to sketchers of all levels.<\/p> <p><b>What makes our sessions different?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 We start on time in a large, clean, well-lit space.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Sketchers\u00a0can concentrate because our room is quiet while the model is posing.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0We have coffee and cookies at the long break.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 We finish on time so you can be headed home at 9:00 p.m sharp!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0(Latecomers can be seated at a break.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/a\/0\/600_395131392.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 This is a two hour drawing session to work from a live (nude) model. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0We start with short 2 minute poses and work up to a 20 minute pose by the end of the session.

In August I took a very last minute trip to Ireland for 3 \u00a0weeks that was all MUSIC in Counties Clare, Mayo and Galway. I saw some amazing sessions with Blackie O' Connell on the uilleann pipes that were spectacular. Since I've been back there's been way too much work so it's time for another meet up. First Tuesday I am going to a film about Yeat's life at the IAC in NY (join me this Tuesday!) so I'm scheduling the meet up for SECOND TUESDAY this month.<\/p> <p>Our Tuesday night open traditional Irish session at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dempseyspub.com\/\">Dempsey's<\/a> in the East Village has been a HUGE success! As your host Robin, I can say all past \u00a0First Tuesdays have been quite a big hit with great music and comaraderie. \u00a0<\/p> <p>It's fall - let's eat, drink and be merry and listen to great music together with John Nevin and the great musicians who join him!<\/p> <p>The Dempsey's session is the longest-running open traditional Irish session in New York, now in its 19th year of Tuesday night tunes and craic. All are welcome, from beginners to intermediate to advanced session musicians and the session is a good mix of all three. Sean nos and ballad singers and folk musicians are welcome as well as the session uses a round-robin format where everyone gets a turn to start a tune or sing a song.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/1\/5\/600_7044341.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe welcoming, open spirit of Dempsey's is known in Irish music circles all over the world and it's not unusual at all for visiting musicians (or singers, or dancers) from the four corners of the earth to stop by for a tune on any given Tuesday night. In 2011, local indie filmmaker Paradox Smoke Productions even made a documentary about the Dempsey's session called \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.beautifulpeopledocfilm.com\/\">Beautiful People<\/a>.\"<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/4\/e\/600_194452302.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor musicians, the session provides a friendly, supportive atmosphere to share your talents and develop your skills. For non-musicians, the session creates an atmosphere of Irish conviviality and craic that few local pubs can match.<\/p> <p>Meetup starts at 7 for drinks, food and conversation, the music starts at 8.

Since she lives in japan, She draws settings in Japan. She thinks to draw not only fun and heartwarming works but also people in various scenes.<\/p> <p>Under the aging society in Japan, there are many social problems such as child abuse, irregular employment, and an increase in poor people receiving livelihood protections. Including such things, she thinks she will continue drawing with the theme of people.<\/p> <p>Her works are drawn from both real experiences and imaginations. She thinks she could send cries through drawings to the generations to live a future. She would like the visitors of her solo exhibition to experience not only one emotion but their own feelings.<\/p> <p>In addition to her works, as an artist she started a project to distribute sketchbooks to children living in child welfare facilities, homeless people, and impoverished people, with the hope that expressing themselves will enrich their minds.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It raised eyebrows in their lifetimes and has only become more controversial since their deaths. From FDR\u2019s lifelong romance with Lucy Mercer to Eleanor\u2019s purported lesbianism\u2014and many scandals in between\u2014the American public has never tired of speculating about the ties that bound these two headstrong individuals. Some claim that Eleanor sacrificed her personal happiness to accommodate FDR\u2019s needs; others claim that the marriage was nothing more than a gracious fa\u00e7ade for political convenience. No one has told the full story until now.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this groundbreaking new account of the marriage, Hazel Rowley describes the remarkable courage and lack of convention\u2014private and public\u2014that kept FDR and Eleanor together. She reveals a partnership that was both supportive and daring. Franklin, especially, knew what he owed to Eleanor, who was not so much behind the scenes as heavily engaged in them. Their relationship was the product of FDR and Eleanor\u2019s conscious efforts\u2014a partnership that they created according to their own ambitions and needs.<\/p> <p>In this dramatic and vivid narrative, set against the great upheavals of the Depression and World War II, Rowley paints a portrait of a tender lifelong companionship, born of mutual admiration and compassion. Most of all, she depicts an extraordinary evolution\u2014from conventional Victorian marriage to the bold and radical partnership that has made Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt go down in history as one of the most inspiring and fascinating couples of all time.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The group will be in the side, glass-enclosed room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club\/events\/219558821\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":7200000,"name":"October Book Discussion","id":"zcltdlytnbqb","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444850616000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1291650343000,"name":"Bay Ridge Book, Game and Social Club","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1747047,"urlname":"Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"East Hanover","address_1":"130 Route 10 W","name":"FAIRBRIDGE HOTEL AND CONFERENCE CENTER","lon":-74.368019,"id":23658659,"lat":40.820282,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.4052639008,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424732852000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Morris County Ski Club meets on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month (the 2nd Tuesday only in June, July, August and December). <b>Although our name says ski club, we are a year round activities and social club.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our membership meetings and happy hours (AAF) are free to attend, and are always fun filled.

That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New Jersey.<\/p> <p>OneTaste is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM.

She is a certified Usui Reiki master and practicing shaman with a deep love of the healing arts. Sarah Eve began her shamanic studies with Izhak Beery and followed with the late Ipupiara, a Makunaiman of the Ure-e-wau-wau Amazonian tribe. She has completed workshops with Tom Cowan and the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. The path of healing also led her to work closely with the Santo Daime community, John of God, and crystal energy work in Brazil. Other international trips including Mexico and Central America, Europe, Israel, and Southeast Asia, she encountered sacred spiritual practices and healers in which she is blessed to share and teach. She completed her 200 &amp; 500 hour yoga training with Sri Dharma Mittra. Integrating her experience also as a vegan chef, she uses food as another medicinal tool in achieving whole body health. She assists in creating a safe space in which you can heal you. www.sarahevecardell.com<\/p> <p><br\/>All text, images, and products presented are copyright. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Sarah Eve Cardell.

While every person experiences anxiety, it is estimated that over a quarter of the population will experience anxiety at levels that cause distress in their lives. There is also an increasing concern for rising anxiety among children and youth. In this MEET UP you will explore the natural purpose of anxiety and how it can become 'disordered,' including the link with panic, depression, trauma and other health concerns.

And his dramatic monologues do explore the male mental field more often than the female -- which we usually see, anyway, through the lens of the male. But a further look reveals that Browning's men place a heavy value on the importance of women in the world. For one thing, women furnish standards of taste, beauty, and [male ideals of] moral propriety. In that way, they sometimes can offer stability and coherence. But they are also a sexual resource, which [men may think] threatens stability. That conflict, or potential conflict, may be what fuels the frequent violence against women in Browning. Anxiety over female freedom, over the inability to control what women are and mean, think and do, can drive men to take steps to correct the matter. We could ask: is this anxiety something Browning himself is conjuring with, or is it something that, as a dramatist, he, as literary observer, takes as part of the field he surveys and depicts? Good question! Come on out to the beautiful National Arts Club and join us for this exciting lecture.

Adventures of Reinforcement Learning in the Real World<br\/>Wednesday, October 14, 2015<br\/>Speaker: Yael Niv<br\/>4:15PM Tea; 5:00PM Lecture<\/p> <p>Animals and humans alike can quickly learn to associate different stimuli in the environment with rewards or punishments. In recent years, ideas from the computational field of reinforcement learning have revolutionized the study of learning in the brain, providing new, precise theories of how such associations are formed. However, although these learning algorithms work well in simplified laboratory scenarios, they are known to suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality\" that makes learning in complex, multidimensional scenarios infeasible. How does the brain scale reinforcement learning to realistic tasks?<\/p> <p>In this lecture, Dr. Yael Niv will argue that the key to learning efficiently in real-world scenarios is to use a simplified representation of the task that includes only those dimensions of the environment that are relevant to obtaining reward. This, however, raises the new question of how such task representations are learned. Dr. Niv will first demonstrate, using behavioral experiments, that animals and humans learn the causal, often hidden structure of a task, thus forming a concise task representation through experience. She will then suggest that these task representations reside in the orbitofrontal cortex, and show how we can visualize these mental maps of task space and how these maps are related to behavioral performance.<\/p> <p>Dr. Niv is associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University. Her work investigates the neural and computational processes underlying reinforcement learning\u2014the ongoing day-to-day processes by which we learn from trial and error to maximize reward and minimize punishment. She is the recipient of the 2015 National Academy of Sciences Troland Research Award, and the 2012 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, is an Ellison Foundation Scholar and was an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GothamAtheists\/events\/225936057\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"INTERDISCIPLINARY: MENTAL MAPS IN ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING: Animal Learning","id":"225936057","time":1444854600000,"updated":1444919565000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1161385494000,"name":"Gotham Atheists","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":349090,"urlname":"GothamAtheists","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Atheists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"129 East 15th Street","name":"Revival","lon":-73.987724,"id":8192902,"state":"NY","lat":40.734428,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.08475530148,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443566929000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey Teachers\/Coders:<\/p> <p>We're excited to present our first teacher happy hour of the year!

For example, Eurodollar futures prices are infinite in the Dothan and Black-Karasinski models, as shown in 1998 by Hogan and Weintraub. These singularities are usually assumed to disappear when the models are simulated in discrete time. Using a precise simulation of the BDT model, we demonstrate that this is true only for sufficiently low volatilities. Eurodollar futures prices explode for volatilities above a critical value. The explosion is due to contributions from a region in state space which corresponds to very large interest rates and is truncated off in usual simulation methods such as trees and finite difference methods. In the limit of a very small simulation time step the explosion appears for any volatility, and reproduces the Hogan-Weintraub singularity of the continuous time model.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p>Dan Pirjol works in the Model Risk Group at JP Morgan, covering valuation models in commodities.

We will discuss the Neutron Advanced Services driver model and how it can be useful to Service Providers (and Enterprises) based on our team's experience powering DreamCompute\u2019s networking capabilities using Akanda. We will review Akanda, an open source suite of software, services, orchestration, and tools for providing L3+ services in OpenStack that builds on top of Linux and OpenStack Neutron. Using Akanda, an OpenStack provider can provide tenants with a rich, powerful set of L3+ services.

Since starting Reality Crowd TV Media Corporation, Manolis has helped 10 companies raise $825,000 (as of 12\/31\/14).<\/p> <p><br\/>His ability to do so has come from his social media business development skillset coupled with access to journalists and bloggers across industries who are interested in writing about innovative startup companies at the early stages of development.<\/p> <p><br\/>Manolis also helps manage social media and communities for larger organizations, growing their user base and sales via online media business development. As the community manager of Patch of Land, over $700,000 in gross revenues have been converted to date via his efforts on social media, an enormous return on investment considering the cost of those services accounted for less than 5% of the funds raised.<\/p> <p><br\/>Manolis understands quickly what needs to be done to take a business to the next level, even if he had not had previous experience within a certain industry. His consultative approach to understanding a business allows both client and consultant to come up with innovative new ways to get the word out about a company and their products or services.

To meet the content data needs of the multiple Economist products in use, and planned, a decoupled microservices architecture is being designed and built.<\/p> <p>The backend is, for the moment, still Drupal 6 with an API added to deliver JSON. The midTier microservices layer uses GoLang. The decoupled, component-based Front End uses Node.js and ReactJS. A side aim of the project is to build a continuous integration environment that will weave the layers together. And a continuous deployment workflow to allow quick changes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This talk will give a high-level view of the project then focus specifically on the Drupal challenges involved.

During the 2 hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash ba<i>r. This event is for singles only (not couples)<\/i>. Upon entering you will be seated at a paint station along side another painter. We encourage you to say hi and make new a friend. We will rotate you (with your canvas) a few times throughout the night so you get to paint and chat with several other people... This makes for a great, fun social experience! While this event is geared toward singles, We don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with) and possibly even end up meeting that special someone.<\/p> <p><br\/>Typically about 80% of attendees of this event come alone and 20% bring a friend. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<br\/><b><br\/><i>Oh - here's a quick note to the men.

Humanity has continued to set these laws into creative motion through thoughts, prayers, motives, intentions, voices, and beliefs.\u00a0These are the right tools. In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true- all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience.

Whether you are looking to connect with a loved one who has recently passed or to receive messages from spirit, our group offers a warm and friendly environment to all who are interested. Before each s\u00e9ance we begin our group with a 15 minute lesson on psychic development, covering topics from psychic impressions to spirit communication. We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours. The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

In 2006, October 15th was named Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. At 7pm in every time zone on October 15th, surviving families across the world light a candle in remembrance of the litte ones they've lost. Knot My Baby will follow suit by having a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge and a candle lighting to conclude the ceremony. Arrive at the Park Row Subway Plaza entrance of City Hall Park in Manhattan, NY at 5:00pm on Thursday, October 15th, 2015 to complete registration. General park address in 31 Chambers Street, Ny, NY 10007. Visit www.NYCGovParks.org\/parks\/city-hall-park to familiarize yourself with the actual entrance we will be meeting at. We will promptly start our walk over the Brooklyn Bridge at 6:00pm and end at McLaughlin Park, located at 243 Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201 between Tillary Street and Catherdral Place to light the flameless candles provided by Knot My Baby at 7pm. If you arrive after we have left, feel free to continue across the bridge as we will be walking slowly and taking pictures as we reach the midway point of the bridge.<\/p> <p>Thereafter, participants are encouraged but not required to join us for dinner at AppleBee's located at 395 Flatbush Avenue Extension, Metro Tech, Brooklyn, NY 11201 directly after for their dine and donate program.

Off the coast of Taiji Japan, free, migrating dolphins are ambushed at sea and driven by a fleet of boats to a once secret cove, where they're captured for the theme park industry and slaughtered for food. This is featured in the Oscar-winning documentary, \"The Cove.\" Join Michael Mah as he shares his travels with Sea Shepherd which is committed to bringing the world's attention to stop this practice. Hear how environmental conservation teams 1) channel a powerful sense of purpose, 2) practice leadership, 3) use social media, 4) create transparency, 5) build trust, and 6) use metrics and data to command the world's attention. Hear Michael's take on what passionate teams muster to move a needle towards a \"tipping point,\" and lessons that your software teams can learn from activist teams in the global environmental conservation movement to bring the quality of their work to new heights.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker:\u00a0<\/b>Michael Mah is managing partner at QSM Associates Inc.

The faces of those children are alight with wonder, with puzzlement, with interest, and yes, with joy. When I imagine students in many of today's classrooms, that image is often static. Locked into a system of learning that too often becomes habitual, the faces of many young people in our schools register boredom, disinterest, or resignation to their fate.<\/p> <p>Early in my teaching career, I recognized my need to guide the educational development of young people in ways that didn't, at the same time, take the joy out of their lives. I reasoned that my classroom environment must effectively support the natural ways in which children learn.<\/p> <p>In the mid-80s, after taking numerous postgraduate courses in the neurosciences, I worked to bridge the gap between emerging knowledge of the brain and the practices of education. Eventually, I shared the ideas with other teachers in workshops entitled \"Learning from the Inside Out.\" At the close of each workshop, I asked participants to comment on the ideas they had found the most valuable. To my surprise, rather than choosing what they had learned about students, most of the teachers commented on how much they had learned about themselves!<\/p> <p>Their comments made me realize the extent to which teachers are ignored in educational planning, except as purveyors of content chosen by others. Yet the beliefs and values that provide the unconscious foundation for teacher behavior, the metaphors that set the stages of their classrooms, and the mental models of the world through which they conceptualize their work, are highly individualistic. Rather than the constants they are often assumed to be, numerous studies suggest that the teacher may well be the most influential variable in the educational equation!<\/p> <p>Substantive change in education is unlikely to occur until educators understand how each teacher's beliefs about the nature of teaching and learning, and the metaphors they use to describe their teaching, influence everything that occurs in the classroom. Teaching in Mind: How Teacher Thinking Shapes Education examines those issues and more. In its pages, I will encourage you to probe the realms of subjective experience\u2014the beliefs, values, presuppositions, and metaphors that shape your personal world.<\/p> <p>The very word subjective makes some researchers in the social sciences cringe. Research is supposed to be based on objectivity. Education has prided itself on applying the scientific approach. Any recommendations for change must be supported by \"hard data\"\u2014by research studies scrupulously conducted using the scientific method. Messy subjective concepts such as beliefs and values don't lend themselves to measurement or statistical manipulation.<\/p> <p>In the past several decades, theorists have finally begun to recognize the importance of what goes on in the mind of an individual teacher. Research studies have explored the effects of teacher beliefs, the metaphors a teacher uses to describe his or her work, and the values a teacher assigns to a particular practice or concept. The studies have found that these thought processes have a profound influence on educational choices. But the results of those studies have been largely limited to academia. It is time for practicing teachers to have access to these ideas. It is the minds of those teachers that must be explored. It is the actions of those teachers that make education what it is today.<\/p> <p>Although my conclusions are my own, I've attempted to include support from as many different disciplines as possible. The references are there for those who want or need them. However, many teachers are less interested in theory than in how they can improve their teaching experience and the experience of their students. The main thrust, therefore, is immediate applicability. It's about what you can do today to be the teacher who matters to students.<\/p> <p>You may be astounded at how differently teachers think\u2014even about the meanings of the words teach, learn, or understand. I invite you to let your own experiences verify the validity of these ideas, rather than some distant study or some theorist's perceptions. Take the ideas you can use and leave the rest for others who may hold different perceptions and have different experiences.<\/p> <p>Despite the wishes of theorists, visionaries, and \"experts,\" there are no simple answers to problems as complex as those educators presently face. If you agree with the adage, \"If what you're doing doesn't work, do something else,\" you will find many ideas to enlarge your repertoire of \"something else.\"<\/p> <p>I sense that many teachers have reached the same level of frustration as people living under Communism when the Berlin Wall fell. In that case, a handful of people who'd had enough rebelled, creating the first breach in the Communist wall\u2014both literally and figuratively. When a relatively small percentage of people create stress in a social system, the entire system shifts to relieve that stress. I invite you to imagine as I do what our schools might be like if they became places where students and teachers alike shared the joyous and innate love of learning with which infants comes into the world.<\/p> <p>A handful of reflective teachers have it within their power to literally \"change the face of education.\" Let us begin.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Judy Yero Bio<\/p> <p>Education -<\/p> <p>\u2022BA from Dominican University: major in Chemistry\/Physics; minor in Philosophy \u2022MA in Curriculum Development from DePaul University \u2022Doctoral coursework completed at the University of Illinois; dual focus on neurophysiology and education\u2014taught teacher education classes as part of the doctoral program<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Master\u2019s\/Trainer level certification in Neurolinguistics<\/p> <p>Teaching experience -<\/p> <p>\u2022Taught 7th-8th grade physical science (3 years) \u2022Taught chemistry, physics, and physical science at a 3,000 student suburban Chicago high school (20 years)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Science department chair\u20146 years Professional Organizations<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Served on textbook evaluation, curriculum, and other national committees for the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Association for Science and Curriculum Development (ASCD) \u2022Served on the joint NSTA-NASA committee that chose the first student-designed projects to be performed in space<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Teacher workshops: \"Learning From the Inside Out.\"<\/p> <p>More about Judy on her website: <a href=\"http:\/\/teachinginmind.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/teachinginmind.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Jamaal Bowman Bio<\/p> <p>Jamaal Bowman is a husband, father of three, and Founding Principal of Cornerstone Academy for Social Action (C.A.S.A.)

The protocol is backwards-compatible with HTTP\/1.1 and is likely to suddenly become ubiquitous when new versions of clients and servers switch it on. But the web development community is still largely ignorant about HTTP\/2 and what it means for their applications.<\/p> <p>This talk will outline the results of a new study by Ragnar Lonn, founder of Load Impact, where we attempt to measure the performance impact different types of applications would typically face if they switch their data transport from HTTP\/1.1 to HTTP\/2.<\/p> <p>As an extra treat, Ragnar will also release the software created as part of the study \u2014 a free online tool for developers to find out what happens performance-wise if their site or application is delivered over HTTP\/2 instead of HTTP\/1.1.<\/p> <p><b>--------------------------------------------------<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BIO<\/b><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/xebialabs\"&gt;<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grabnerandi\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>Load Impact CTO Robin Gustafsson is a system architecture expert who\u2019s been working with the company since it was founded in 2009.

Andrea\u2019s deep understanding of the essence of Western mystical and transcendental thought makes this a book you will treasure and refer to often as you advance in your mystical studies.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business practice that involves company initiatives that give back - for example, donating a portion of proceeds to charity, minimizing carbon emissions and waste, organizing employee volunteer opportunities, or initiating cause-marketing programs - each designed to use business as a force for good.<\/p> <p>With more companies integrating CSR practices, this panel discussion will explore the challenges and opportunities of using business to positively impact society and the environment.

The ships range from schooners to freighters and most of them sit on the lake bottom in the cold, fresh water just frozen in time. The names of the ships can still been seen on some of the wooden hulls, rigging on the masts that are still standing 70ft tall, and dozens of artifacts to be seen on each wreck. The lakes offer something for everyone from snorkeling to technical diving and each wreck has a story to tell.\u00a0<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p>Becky Schott is a multiple Emmy Award-winning underwater cameraman, photographer, and accomplished technical diver whose work can be seen on major networks including National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and the Travel Channel. She is co-owner of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.liquidproductionsllc.com\/\">Liquid Productions,\u00a0<\/a>Inc, specializing in capturing quality imagery in challenging environments. Her projects have taken her all over the globe from exploring virgin wrecks in over 300 feet of water in the Great Lakes, rappelling into caves in the jungle, filming under ice in the Arctic to diving cage-less with great white sharks.<\/p> <p>Becky is extremely passionate about sharing the underwater world with others both through her imagery or teaching someone to\u00a0dive. She's been teaching scuba since 2000 and is an active technical diving instructor and TDI Rebreather Instructor.
