Continue on Aqua trail to north of Allison Park to St. Peter\u2019s College, then turn right at Englewood Cliff Entrance then hike south along the shore at Boat Basin to Ross Dock Picnic Area, continue on the white-blazed Shore Trail south beneath the Bridge, passing Hazard\u2019s Dock, for another 0.5 mi., where it will turn uphill to the southern park entrance, back on Hudson Terrace, turn north on the multi-use path and return to the starting point.<\/p> <p><b>ATTRACTIONS:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Great View of the George Washington Bridge<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/3\/8\/600_309189272.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Little Stone Castle<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/f\/a\/600_387386362.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0Giant Stairs<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/gooutsidenyc.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/11\/1235101_649720582916_1641325516_n.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 GreenBrook Waterfall<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2090\/2166452685_b84d7f1582_z.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Palisades Interstate Park<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/a\/0\/600_309189632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DIFFICULTY:<\/b>\u00a0Easy<br\/><b>DISTANCES:<\/b>\u00a06 Miles<br\/><b>DURATION:<\/b>\u00a04 Hours<\/p> <p><b>RECOMMENDED ITEMS TO BRING:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 2x 1 Lite of bottle water<br\/>\u2022 Lunch<br\/>\u2022 Snacks &amp; Fruits<br\/>\u2022 Sun Screen<br\/>\u2022<\/p> <p><b>RECOMMENDED CLOTHES TO WEAR:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Hat<br\/>\u2022 Sun Glasses<br\/>\u2022 Warm Clothing \u00a0<br\/>\u2022 Hiking Boots or Shoes<br\/>\u2022 Lightweight Back Pack<br\/>\u2022 Lightweight workout pants<\/p> <p><b>TRANSPORTATION:<\/b> $[Edit]<br\/>[Link]<\/p> <p><b>MAPS:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/trailmapMiddle.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/trailmapMiddle.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/trailmapMiddle.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>WEATHER:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:07024.1.99999\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:07024.1.99999\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.wunderground.com\/q\/zmw:07024.1.99999<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>REFERENCE:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesEasy.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesEasy.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesEasy.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

Loren (Princess Layer), our assistant organizer has been with Boardwalk since its inception.

She\u2019s done this on many occasions smoothly and without a hitch. The perfect example was the last Gift of Life Foundation \"Walk For Life\" at Eisenhower Park. My computer was down and Loren took over without fanfare. Loren is also my memory and my motivator, nagging me until I finally put something on the Boardwalk schedule.

The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth (Russell) and his fugitive Daisy Domergue (Leigh), race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as \u201cThe Hangman,\u201d will bring Domergue to justice. Along the road, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), a black former union soldier turned infamous bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix (Goggins), a southern renegade who claims to be the town\u2019s new Sheriff. Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie\u2019s Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie\u2019s, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob (Bichir), who\u2019s taking care of Minnie\u2019s while she\u2019s visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray (Roth), the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Dern). As the storm overtakes the mountainside stopover, our eight travelers come to learn they may not make it to Red Rock after all\u2026<\/p> <p>THE HATEFUL EIGHT marks a continuation of the long-standing relationship between the celebrated filmmaker and the Weinsteins, who have collaborated on all of Tarantino\u2019s films from RESERVOIR DOGS through DJANGO UNCHAINED.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/gnRbXn4-Yis\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/gnRbXn4-Yis<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>The exclusive roadshow engagement that THE HATEFUL EIGHT is embarking on will replicate the special event releases that films used to receive in the early and mid-twentieth century. They screened a longer version of the film than would have been shown in wide release, including a musical overture to start the show and an intermission between acts, and moviegoers received a special souvenir program. THE HATEFUL EIGHT roadshow experience will offer moviegoers all three special features. Roadshows were the gold standard for exhibiting pictures like LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, GONE WITH THE WIND, CLEOPATRA, BATTLE OF THE BULGE, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN HUR.<\/p> <p>TWC and Tarantino\u2019s presentation of THE HATEFUL EIGHT will mark the widest 70mm release that the industry has seen in over twenty years. The film will open in 44 markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta, Washington DC, Houston, Detroit, Phoenix, Seattle, Tampa, Minneapolis, Denver, Miami, Cleveland, Orlando, Sacramento, St. Louis, Portland, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Baltimore, San Diego, Nashville, Kansas City, San Antonio, West Palm Beach, Birmingham, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Austin, New Orleans, Providence, Knoxville, Santa Barbara, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver. Quentin and cast members from THE HATEFUL EIGHT will be touring the country making surprise appearances in select cities at 70mm roadshow showings.<\/p> <p>Not since the 1966 film Khartoum starring Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier has a film been shot in Ultra Panavision 70 format. In 2012, TWC distributed Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s acclaimed film THE MASTER in a similar 70mm format. Beloved by filmmakers and cinephiles for its wide-scope and high-resolution image quality, Ultra Panavision70mm stock captures nearly twice the landscape of the more common 35mm and digital styles. Because of its unique quality and its importance to the art of filmmaking, Quentin, TWC, and a number of other major Hollywood directors and studios have negotiated deals with Kodak to continue production of 70mm and other film formats despite their higher costs and complexity of use.<\/p> <p>The lead cast for THE HATEFUL EIGHT includes Samuel L. Jackson (DJANGO UNCHAINED), Kurt Russell (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), Jennifer Jason Leigh (MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE), Walton Goggins (Justified), Demian Bichir (A BETTER LIFE), Tim Roth (RESERVOIR DOGS), Michael Madsen (RESERVOIR DOGS), and Bruce Dern (NEBRASKA).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCGrindhouse\/events\/227566204\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Celebrate Christmas Grindhouse style with THE HATEFUL EIGHT!","id":"227566204","time":1451153700000,"updated":1451402269000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297642164000,"name":"NYC GRINDHOUSE","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1783262,"urlname":"NYCGrindhouse","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Sick n'twisted fkers!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"inside Central Park","address_2":"near Fifth Ave and E 65 St","name":"Central Park Zoo gate","lon":-73.994309,"id":1306042,"state":"NY","lat":40.752664,"repinned":false},"headcount":54,"distance":0.291733920574,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448650314000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.80000019073},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is our 7th annual Central Park Zoo event and photo contest.<\/p> <p>1) Everyone will purchase their own ticket and you can do so online.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/centralparkzoo.com\/tickets\"><a href=\"http:\/\/centralparkzoo.com\/tickets\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/centralparkzoo.com\/tickets<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>2) We will meet in front of the entrance so please try to arrive on time.<\/p> <p>3) After the event, post up to 3 pictures ( no more) and we will pick a winner who will get a great gift card and the tittle of Winter 2015 Champion!!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThanks<\/p> <p>Lyndon<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet righr outside the entrance","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nycphotography\/events\/227056927\/","yes_rsvp_count":54,"name":"Central Park Zoo and Photo Contest","id":"227056927","time":1451154600000,"updated":1451418189000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1034097746000,"name":"\"The New York City Digital Photography Meetup Group\"","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":45494,"urlname":"nycphotography","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Digital Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":5,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446435260000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Event Type: Museum<\/p> <p>Admission Price:\u00a0Pay as You Wish ($1.00 Suggested)<\/p> <p>Description:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/f\/7\/600_443765879.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Brooklyn Museum is an art museum located in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Not only is this big house one of the few homes lit up in Jamaica Estates, but also one of\u00a0the best in the city.<\/p> <p>Next, we'll take a MTA NYC bus (have one extra fare on your Metro Card)\u00a0to the next location. At that point <b>(which will be about 4:30 PM or 5:00 PM)<\/b>, if you want to bail out, you can take the Q 46 bus at Union Turnpike to the Kew Gardens\/Union Turnpike station subway stop (the \"F\" train) or the Q 17 bus at Union Turnpike\/188th Street\u00a0back to the Jamaica station subway stop at 179th Street and Hillside Avenue (the \"F\" train). For those who want to continue, we'll take the Q 76 bus (in the opposite direction) at Union Turnpike\/Francis Lewis Boulevard for about 12 to 15 minutes to another Queen's neighborhood\u00a0 to look at a second spectacular holiday lights display (possibly the best holiday lights display in the United States).\u00a0<\/p> <p>The holiday decorations on this house are\u00a0unbelievable. Just about every inch of the house is lit up and the lights are visible to planes landing at nearby LaGuardia Airport! The family's home features 300 blow-molds (those huge figurine-like characters that light up), more than 100 animatronics and at least 300,000 bright lights. Displayed are classic figures of Santa and snowmen, music, and moving model trains. These decorations also include a\u00a0virtual Santa Claus\u00a0in a second-story\u00a0window that is achieved with a DVD player and a projector. The festivities extend into the family's house, where the living room is filled with decorations and there is a 10-foot tree that the family cut down upstate<\/p> <p><br\/>After we finish looking at this house, we'll\u00a0briefly look at more holiday light\u00a0decorations in this neighborhood and then take a MTA NYC bus, the Q 76, from Francis Lewis Boulevard back to the starting point. The bus ride will take about 20 to 25 minutes to return back to the \"F\" subway train stop at 179th Street and Hillside Avenue about 6:50 PM.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring your sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk. This is for the organizer's Meetup preparation costs and fees.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Time:<\/b>\u00a0The meeting\u00a0time is <i>(after lunch)<\/i> at <b>2:30 PM<\/b>. <b>Allow extra traveling time because you will have to take the \"F\" subway train to the last stop in Queens.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Place<\/b>: The meeting place is\u00a0outside of the front of McDonalds Restaurant. The address is\u00a0McDonalds Restaurant, 18125 Hillside Avenue (between 181st Street and Avon Street), Jamaica, NY.\u00a0After you get off the subway stop, walk about three blocks east along Hillside Avenue and go past 180th Street, Midland Parkway and 181st Street.<\/p> <p>Before the walk, restrooms are located in the back of McDonalds Restaurant. After we start the walk, we'll have limited opportunities\u00a0for a restroom stop because we'll be walking in mostly\u00a0two residential neighborhoods. There might be a few places for a restroom stop on Union Turnpike.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation:<\/b>\u00a0Take the\u00a0\"F\" subway train to 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica (Queens), New York. This is the last stop on the \"F\" subway train in Queens.\u00a0After getting off the train, walk about three blocks east along Hillside Avenue and go past 180th Street, Midland Parkway, and 181st Street. McDonalds Restaurant is between 181st Street and Avon Street on Hillside Avenue.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions:<\/b>\u00a0 You might be able to park your car two or three blocks north of Hillside Avenue in Jamaica Estates. From Hillside Avenue, <b>go north<\/b> on Midland Parkway (past the \"Jamaica Estates\" Gatehouse).\u00a0Midland Parkway is about one block west from McDonalds Restaurant on Hillside Avenue. On the weekend, parking is usually available on Midland Avenue or one of the side streets in Jamaica Estates. Read the parking signs carefully because Jamaica Estates has a private security force that looks for illegally parked cars.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Time\/Place:<\/b>\u00a0This\u00a0walk will finish about 6:50 PM back at McDonalds Restaurant, the starting point.<\/p> <p>Rainy\/snowy weather or\u00a0cold\/windy conditions will\u00a0cancel this walk. Therefore, if it is rainy\/snowy weather or cold\/windy conditions or the forecast is for rainy\/snowy weather or cold\/windy conditions, I will post a cancellation\u00a0notice\u00a0on Saturday morning. <b>This walk will only happen in\u00a0good weather conditions.<\/b> If I don't post a cancellation notice, I plan to be at the meeting place. <b>If I do cancel the walk, I will also post a cancellation notice on the Discussion Board, and then reschedule the walk. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/b\/e\/600_444924510.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/c\/1\/600_444924513.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/c\/4\/600_444924516.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/8\/4\/600_444959012.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/>\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-and-NJ-Walks-Explore-Architecture-Art-History-Sculpture\/events\/227317661\/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"name":"Jamaica Estates Walk Plus Two Spectacular Holiday Lights Displays!

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

This history clearly traces the primary concepts of Christianity to Ancient Kemet through its influence in the Mediterranean region.<br\/>Ancient Kemet's intricate spiritual system was fully formed thousands of years before most systems in the European world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As this is a multimedia presentation, you will see dozens of supporting images. Brother Osaze will also describe how the esoteric symbols of Ancient Kemet and other the \"mystery\" based traditions in the Mediterranean region were appropriated by early Christians who were then divided in a large array of groups. When some of these Christian groups sought to utilize Christianity as a unifying factor in the Roman Empire, they claimed many of these ancient symbols for themselves. This bloody history is unfamiliar today. Most who claim to study the history of Christianity simple acquaint themselves with one source; the Bible. Fortunately this story can be reconstructed, many of Christianity's most familiar characteristics can<br\/>be found in these earlier traditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This lecture will describe many of these characteristics and illustrate their African origins.

They also have THE BEST hot apple cider you will ever taste.<\/p> <p>This is a great chance to make new friends and to hang out with some old friends. A bunch of my friends (all different ages) come to this show as well as locals and comedy lovers. We also have an Instagram photo contest. Whoever takes the coolest photos of the event and posts them on Instagram with #hashtagcomedy will win TWO free tickets to an upcoming show! We will chose 2 winners the Monday after the show!<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!!<\/p> <p>Hashtag Comedy invites some of the best comics to comment on today's hottest issues.

Thanks for showing up. We're playing again this Sunday at Dyker Beach park; it's the artificial turf field on 14th Ave and Benson Ave. Please show up early so we can try to save a spot on the field or others will try to crowd us out.<\/p> <p>A couple of announcements:<\/p> <p>- I want to announce that Moe has been promoted to assistant organizer. His attendance and level\/fair gamesmanship will help us to improve our meetup group. We're proud to have him on our leadership team.<\/p> <p>- The instant tag upon touch by a defender, as opposed to the requirement of a \"football move,\" is going along well. It has cut down on the bickering. We'll continue to use this rule and we'll monitor its progress on a continuous basis.<\/p> <p>- Our drafting of teams by QBs hasn't gone as smoothly as we had hoped. It takes long to set up the teams, it's not a nice feeling being drafted towards the end, some ppl can't draft well, some QBs draft the same people every time, some ppl don't like being drafted by the same QB, etc. When I pick the teams I try to even it out as best as possible (of course if a QB is stellar then their team may not be as high octane because a great QB can make a team that much better as a whole than the pieces they're given). I've heard many complaints thus far with the draft system. If you have any thoughts I'm open for opinions and suggestions. I reserve the right to pick the teams so receivers are rotated with different QBs.<\/p> <p>Sunday should be very nice weather, in the mid 60's. Come join us for some fun but please SHOW UP ON TIME!! If you show up after we started a game then you will sit out the whole first game.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n***************<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Attendance will be strictly enforced.

We need to know how many people will show up in order to decide if we have enough people for a game that week.<\/p> <p>All new members are allowed to play for free the first three games.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/227517327\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytqbkc","time":1451224800000,"updated":1451236397000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hartsdale","address_1":"475 w hartsdale ave, hartsdale NY","name":"Pat Capone rd football field","lon":-73.79995,"id":24225494,"state":"NY","lat":41.030727,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":21.8332195282,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406687537000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ATTENTION!

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it.

He planned these publications with his characteristic vigilance and zeal, seeking a perfect fusion of image and text.

The New York Transit Museum typically displays these vehicles during special events at the museum or around the city, but are offering these holiday nostalgia rides to the public for a limited time with the swipe of a\u00a0MetroCard. Some vintage buses also will be on display at Union Square, Herald Square and at the Circle Line Terminal.<\/p> <p>For four consecutive Sundays in December, subway customers can catch the \u201cShoppers Special,\u201d a train consisting of eight cars from the\u00a01930s\u00a0that ran along the lettered lines until the late\u00a01970s. The cars, which were ordered for the Independent Subway System (IND), were the first subway cars to be identified by their contract numbers, hence the\u00a0R1\/9 designations.\u00a0R1\/9 cars, known as \u201c\u201cCity-Cars,\u201d have rattan seats, ceiling fans, incandescent light bulbs, and roll signs for passenger information. Their design of more doors that were also wider and faster, plus increased standing capacity to accommodate crowds, served as the model of modern subway cars, and their dimensions are identical to the latest\u00a0R160\u00a0cars. They were retired from service in 1977.<\/p> <p><b>ATTRACTIONS:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Vintage Subways Rides from the 1930's and up<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/7\/6168\/6179767844_a201d402ac_z.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Actors in 1930's Dress Performance<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-71rUpbo9sw8\/Tu1gTw3-2vI\/AAAAAAAAOSc\/g1lKOyTMFFc\/s1600\/DSC_0425.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-71rUpbo9sw8\/Tu1gTw3-2vI\/AAAAAAAAOSc\/g1lKOyTMFFc\/s1600\/DSC_0425.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022 Music from the 1930's<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-y8stutftxqs\/Tu1lH5v_GzI\/AAAAAAAAOUM\/pwWblx6sQGU\/s1600\/DSC_0518.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-y8stutftxqs\/Tu1lH5v_GzI\/AAAAAAAAOUM\/pwWblx6sQGU\/s1600\/DSC_0518.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p><b>WEATHER:<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Event is Indoors<\/p> <p><b>MAP:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/21+St+-+Queensbridge+%5BF%5D\/2nd+Avenue+%5BF%5D\/@40.7453762,-73.9900142,14z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258d6b30fab3b:0x77e2cb2e53015e9d!2m2!1d-73.9424742!2d40.7541777!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2598465e5fc85:0x8173505c2f7ec42e!2m2!1d-73.9912918!2d40.7239366!3e3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/21+St+-+Queensbridge+%5BF%5D\/2nd+Avenue+%5BF%5D\/@40.7453762,-73.9900142,14z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258d6b30fab3b:0x77e2cb2e53015e9d!2m2!1d-73.9424742!2d40.7541777!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2598465e5fc85:0x8173505c2f7ec42e!2m2!1d-73.9912918!2d40.7239366!3e3\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/21+St+-+Queensbridge+%5BF%5D\/2nd+Avenue+%5BF%5D\/@40.7453762,-73.9900142,14z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258d6b30fab3b:0x77e2cb2e53015e9d!2m2!1d-73.9424742!2d40.7541777!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2598465e5fc85:0x8173505c2f7ec42e!2m2!1d-73.9912918!2d40.7239366!3e3<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>REFERENCE:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mta.info\/news-nostalgia-ride-vintage-bus-vintage-train-subway-bus\/2015\/11\/25\/mta-new-york-city-transit-ny\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mta.info\/news-nostalgia-ride-vintage-bus-vintage-train-subway-bus\/2015\/11\/25\/mta-new-york-city-transit-ny\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mta.info\/news-nostalgia-ride-vintage-bus-vintage-train-subway-bus\/2015\/11\/25\/mta-new-york-city-transit-ny<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/226189307\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Adult Education","id":"fpbtflytqblc","time":1451345400000,"updated":1451356872000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Mystics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":1.25659668446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442452831000,"fee":{"amount":9.25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Like our Facebook Page!:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ManhattanInternationalCoedSoccer\">facebook.com\/ManhattanInternationalCoedSoccer<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/8\/6\/600_323794182.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Game description:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Teams are 4 V 4, no goalies, no gender requirements (but we'd like at least 1 female player per team).

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

We are not a singles group or a dating network. Instead, we are a family where it is safe to be ourselves. The goal of the meeting is to help members to develop into healthier, more complete, independent, loving men and women. We hope that by being together, listening to each other, and by sharing our experiences, strength and hope, we will learn to see the value of life in a new context. For the first hour of each meeting members share their experiences. The second half of the meeting is reserved for a guest speaker relating to either the legal or emotional aspects of separation\/divorce.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation.

It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself.

You\u2019re thinking of Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984). This also isn\u2019t Silent Night, Evil Night, the alternate title of Black Christmas (1974), which I showed <a href=\"http:\/\/hoffmatthews.com\/2014\/12\/03\/upcoming-show-hoffs-horrorfest-presents-black-christmas\/\">last year<\/a>.<\/p> <p>No, this is the 1972 proto-slasher and <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=9D3BT2AepkgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fright+night+on+channel+9&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipi4OYitjJAhXDOyYKHbJVC4wQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=silent%20night%20bloody%20night&amp;f=false\">longtime late night TV staple<\/a> Silent Night, BLOODY Night, a whole other toy soldier in the ranks of Christmas-themed slasher movies, most of which I don\u2019t find all that appealing. Too often they don\u2019t seem to try to be scary so much as nasty, reveling in their supposed subversiveness by filling their holiday milieus with lecherous Santas, spoiled brats and brutal gore. And that\u2019s a shame, because the chilly gloom of winter actually provides an ideally eerie atmosphere for fright. Just ask the English, for whom ghost stories are a classic Yuletide tradition, including but far from limited to Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol. Most Christmas horror movies don\u2019t take advantage of the holiday\u2019s potential for genuine creepiness; this is one of the precious few (including this year\u2019s Krampus, I\u2019d say) that do.<\/p> <p>Which is not to say that Silent Night, Bloody Night isn\u2019t nasty. No one\u2019s mistaking this story of a series of Christmas Eve murders in a small town with a dark past as heartwarming family fare, but its macabre subject matter is couched in the well-sketched context of a desolate, snowy New England winter. It won\u2019t fill you with good cheer, but it will make you want to curl up by a fire with some hot chocolate. It\u2019s also notable because of the people who worked on it, including Troma\u2019s Lloyd Kaufman and various Andy Warhol associates, as well as its potential influence on later holiday slashers like Black Christmas and Halloween.<\/p> <p>So come on by on the 28th for a cozy evening of Christmas fear, along with a few jokes because hey, that\u2019s my thing. I\u2019ll bring some egg nog!

ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous.

Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket unless you buy a gift card at the theater and pre-load it 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to drive there in advance if you want seats near us.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

This is when our regular bi-weekly general meeting usually meets, but this week we'll be distributing petitions to get Bernie and his delegates on the ballot to anyone who can help collect signatures. That means anyone who is a registered Democrat in NY State! Maybe you. We'll also be collecting signatures for those who simply want to pop by, grab a beer and sign a petition. There will be a lot of Team Bernie NY regulars here, as well as lots of new people so a great chance to meet other volunteers and get looped into projects.

Or, we can use this as an opportunity to interact with each other without feeling pressured to say much.<\/p> <p>** I will bring games like* Dixit, Cranium, Avalon, Age of War, Saboteur, Wits &amp; Wagers, What's Yours Like?, Jenga DK, Sheriff of Nottingham, Say Anything, Guesstures &amp; Telestrations to name a few. Make a Request for me to bring your favorite game for certain...<\/p> <p>* Also its not a requirement but If you can please bring a game to share. Please also leave a comment telling members what game you'll bring. This helps to drum up interest. You may also bring a snack to share with us if you wish.<\/p> <p>The Sony Atrium or Sony Plaza is a indoor public space with tables and chairs. It's near but not in the Sony Store or Starbucks. Once you entered the Sony Atrium please look through the entire atrium for a red black &amp; white meetup sign on one of the tables with the words \"SA Meetup Group\" printed on it.
