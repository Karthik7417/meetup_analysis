Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

Our current members are from Nigeria, Japan, Korea, Denmark, Great Britain, India, Belgium, and the U.S. Our repertoire is always growing in response to the interests of the group. In the past few years we have sung music from South Africa, the U.S., Bulgaria, Ireland, Japan, and more. We\u2019ve sung in several South African languages, Bengali, Japanese, Bulgarian, French, Yiddish, Croatian, and English. While there are no auditions required to join the choir, we do work very hard to develop our group sound and to be true to the music, as we engage with each new song. Our rehearsals are joyful, playful, and very focused. We welcome anyone who can sing in tune, is willing to put time into learning their parts during the week using the practice tapes our director provides, and who can come to most of our Sunday afternoon rehearsals. We meet on the UWS and Washington Heights.&nbsp;If you're interested in learning more about the choir, or attending a rehearsal, contact Rebecca at <a href=\"mailto:cityworldmusic@gmail.com\">cityworldmusic@gmail.com<\/a>.

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

Join me and a wonderful group of friendly, non-judgmental men for some shopping at the Grand Army Farmers Market, followed by a picnic in Prospect Park. This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!). This is all about building a cool community, meeting new people, being supportive, eating local, quality food and kicking off the weekend with some positivity. Why not avoid the brunch wait, and instead come enjoy the sun, fresh air, and good company?

The questions aren't difficult; they are intended to give us a chance to practice speaking without preparation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Prepared Speeches: Two or three members deliver speeches that they have prepared in advance. These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting.

We need persons educated in other areas\/ industries in beauty, make up, art, fashion, beauty products, personal care products who believe that Cruelty Free IS the compassionate way to live&nbsp; ... As a group, we will respect all the Earth\u2019s inhabitants and will not condone unnecessary harm in the name of beauty and\/or fashion. We will campaign within these industries to speak for those with no voice or rights and will not abuse animals in the name of beauty and\/or fashion. We can help each other grow in our Cruelty Free business, promoting products &amp; services that truly are Cruelty Free! We can educate each other and ask all our clients\/ patrons to join us ... Lets MAKE A DIFFERENCE!<\/p>\n<p> <br>PLEASE BE PATIENT WHILE WE GET THIS ORGANIZED! <br><\/p>","lon":-74.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7358303,"name":"kat Parker ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/d\/5\/highres_245731189.jpeg","photo_id":245731189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/d\/5\/member_245731189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/d\/5\/thumb_245731189.jpeg"}},"members":76,"name":"Beauties Against Animal Cruelty","id":18547677,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Beauties-Against-Animal-Cruelty","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":41.0099983215,"who":"LifeSavers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1429042355000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"quilting","name":"Quilting","id":229},{"urlkey":"sewing","name":"Sewing","id":1111},{"urlkey":"fabric-crafts","name":"Fabric Crafts","id":21827},{"urlkey":"art-quilting","name":"Art Quilting","id":23954},{"urlkey":"machine-quilting","name":"Machine Quilting","id":45475},{"urlkey":"sewing-for-beginners","name":"Sewing for Beginners","id":50364},{"urlkey":"quilters","name":"Quilters","id":62539},{"urlkey":"quilting-for-fun","name":"Quilting for Fun","id":63901},{"urlkey":"quilting-for-beginners-and-experianced-persons","name":"Quilting for Beginners and Experianced Persons","id":63902},{"urlkey":"designing-and-making-quilts","name":"Designing and Making Quilts","id":63904},{"urlkey":"meeting-friends-while-quilting","name":"Meeting Friends while Quilting","id":63905},{"urlkey":"needle-art","name":"Needle Art","id":89860},{"urlkey":"hand-quilting","name":"Hand Quilting","id":90409},{"urlkey":"sewing-for-the-love-of-it","name":"Sewing for the Love of it","id":100566},{"urlkey":"machine-or-hand-piecing-and-quilting","name":"Machine or hand piecing and quilting","id":150964}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Goodstitches-White-Plains\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>Hi There!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>We are a group of lively, fun, friendly, kind and talented people.

Just by showing up and paying the entry free you are supporting a local musician or band. Typically cover charges go directly to a performing act once a minimum threshold has been met by the host venue. Due to the the vast amount of venues in NYC local bands may encounter audiences that are spread very thinly from venue to venue. By forming a group we can give selected local acts eager for new fans an opportunity to play for larger audience.<br><\/p>\n<p>In the future, Rock &amp; Effect NYC will be looking to partner with local music arts charitable organizations in combination with local venues to provide fundraising opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><b>How can I join the group?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Joining is easy.

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit. You will be free to control your future because of your fitness level rather than being confined and restricted by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/highres_438394699.jpeg","photo_id":438394699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/600_438394699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/thumb_438394699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186822598,"name":"Jim Goldfuss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/highres_245822972.jpeg","photo_id":245822972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/member_245822972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/thumb_245822972.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT)","id":18572613,"state":"NY","urlname":"Long-Island-Fitness-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430583604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"city-exploration","name":"city exploration","id":18942},{"urlkey":"local-activities","name":"Local Activities","id":64867},{"urlkey":"city-walks","name":"City Walks","id":113737},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-york-city","name":"Exploring New York City","id":131810}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/City-Explorers\/","rating":0,"description":"Group for those interested in walking around in the city in new places, discovering new things.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":115796622,"name":"Katie ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/highres_166296742.jpeg","photo_id":166296742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/member_166296742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/thumb_166296742.jpeg"}},"members":452,"name":"City Explorers","id":18573217,"state":"NY","urlname":"City-Explorers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430585976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"small-business-online-marketing","name":"Small Business Online Marketing","id":84796},{"urlkey":"business-plans","name":"Business Plans","id":114893},{"urlkey":"winning-business-plans-and-strategies","name":"Winning Business Plans and Strategies","id":370031},{"urlkey":"business-plan-financials","name":"Business Plan Financials","id":923262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SCORE-NYC-Business-Mentoring-and-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"SCORE NYC offers affordable workshops in a wide range of small business topics.

Do you have a sincere interest in the Japanese language beyond just anime and J-pop?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, this may be the group for you.\n\nWe're a group of Japanese language enthusiasts who are looking to create an environment that will afford us the tools, resources, and opportunities to take our Japanese to the level of true fluency and we hope to find like-minded individuals to contribute to our study sessions.\n\nNew York City is a great place for learning languages because it's so easy to find people from all across the world who speak many languages, but despite this fact, opportunities to study the Japanese language are often aimed at low-level learners. We want to change this by creating a group with high ideals and dedication to focused study through various activities and events related to Japanese language.\n\nThis group is currently a work in progress--or perhaps more of an experiment, and we are looking for members that can help us grow into something truly great. So if you are hardcore about Japanese language, please join!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13999114,"name":"Ajani Oloye","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/d\/4\/highres_245904276.jpeg","photo_id":245904276,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/d\/4\/member_245904276.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/d\/4\/thumb_245904276.jpeg"}},"members":67,"name":"Advanced Japanese Study & Practice NYC","id":18576808,"state":"NY","urlname":"Advanced-Japanese-Study-Practice-NYC","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u9054\u4eba"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430808634000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"datamanagement","name":"Data Management","id":10494},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"engineering","name":"Engineering","id":21750},{"urlkey":"high-scalability-computing","name":"High Scalability Computing","id":24410},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"data-mining","name":"Data Mining","id":55324},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-BIG-Data-Hadoop-Analytics-Learning-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Hello!

Anything Viking goes here so if your interested in Norse Mythology or just want to hang out drink party and fight like the Vikings did in their time you came to the right place!!! <br> The Long Island Vikings reenactment organization was formed to share knowledge of these amazing explorers and to fairly represent the peoples we collectively refer to as Vikings. We cultivate all the skills needed to survive in the Viking era and we share what we have learned freely with anyone interested. Our goal is to educate ourselves and others about the challenges these explorers and settlers faced and about the historical realities of life in the Viking age. <br> <br> We are guided first by archeology, keeping our representation close to the recorded physical culture left behind in Viking era settlements. We have rules concerning the fabrics and dyes used in our reenactor clothing and the use of metals, bone, leather and fur. We disallow modern items that would \"break the spell.\" Our aim is to provide an accurate and educational portrayal of the Viking period, with an emphasis on the daily life of the period. And now and again, we have a little fun reenacting the more warlike aspects of life in what was a formative period in European history. <br> <br> There are many ways to participate. Some simply enjoy studying the Vikings and participating in informed discussion. Others are experimental archeologists with their own \"need to know\"--a passion to learn about textiles, paint, weaving, woodworking, blacksmithing and even iron smelting. Many enjoy living in a Viking period encampment, experiencing firsthand the challenges of daily life in a former age (even if only for the weekend). And some are looking for the warrior life, recreating Viking combat and reliving great battles. If you want to get involved, join us on Facebook. <br> <br> Many of our members are available for school visits (in character) and our groups can add education and thrills to your local festivals. Contact us to find out who is available in your area. We were all once fifth graders, too. The difference is that now we know what Leif left behind--spindle whorls, ship rivets, ring pins--and we can probably pull one out of our bag to show you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>check us out on Facebook&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>join our Facebook group &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/?ref=bookmarks\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/?ref=bookmarks<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/highres_447766734.jpeg","photo_id":447766734,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/600_447766734.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/thumb_447766734.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":92411542,"name":"BATMAN","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/highres_254713108.jpeg","photo_id":254713108,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/member_254713108.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/thumb_254713108.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"Long Island Vikings","id":18583654,"state":"NY","urlname":"LIVIKINGS","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"VIKINGS"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431103110000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sportsfans","name":"Sports Fan","id":83},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"astoria","name":"Astoria","id":78158},{"urlkey":"queens","name":"Queens","id":85799},{"urlkey":"long-island-city","name":"Long Island City","id":85800},{"urlkey":"forest-hills","name":"Forest Hills","id":759312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ny-queens\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p>Join the group and you'll have the opportunity to meet new friends as you explore different spots throughout Queens.

I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F. Being able to work from anywhere in the world is one of the greatest benefits the Internet can provide for you.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>_______________<\/p> \n<p>Please join our group and meet us for social gatherings to share online marketing ideas, business opportunities, traffic generation techniques, or simply just to mastermind and socialize.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><i>\"To associate with other like-minded people in small purposeful groups is for the great majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction\"<\/i> ~ Aldos Huxley<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/highres_439170983.jpeg","photo_id":439170983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/600_439170983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/thumb_439170983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183873918,"name":"Meidee Lim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/highres_243221504.jpeg","photo_id":243221504,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/member_243221504.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/thumb_243221504.jpeg"}},"members":241,"name":"New York Online Business & Entrepreneurs Meetup","id":18583893,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Online-Business-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Online Marketers & Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431115527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Webinars\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To thrive in today's economy, you need knowledge.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned. They should be banned&nbsp; now.\u201d Rosemary Dreger Carey, an organizer for 350NJ, says, \u201cTransporting highly volatile oil by any means--train, pipeline or barge--is inherently unsafe. And it is unnecessary because we have the technology and natural resources right here in New Jersey to switch to clean, safe renewable energy.\u201d The Danger Zone March is one of six grassroots events happening across New Jersey and New York to oppose risky and unnecessary area fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Pilgrim Pipeline and Port Ambrose LNG (liquid natural gas) facility.&nbsp;

The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value.

A few days later he found himself in the military camp, T2, outside of Goma, where he met five boys being held prisoner by the national army. The boys had been child soldiers, taken from their homes and forced to fight for rebel groups, until one night they escaped and ran to the national army for refuge. Now they were being treated as enemies of the state.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>He spent the day with the boys, trading stories laughter and tears. One boy told him of children too small to carry guns being sent to the front-lines, armed with only a whistle. Sean wrote to a few friends of this single story of a single day, who then forwarded it around the world. Thousands of strangers wrote back asking: what can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fallingwhistles.com\">Falling Whistles<\/a> is a non-profit organization campaigning for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our goal is to create a sustainable peace and to help local entrepreneurs rebuild their war-torn community. We work with Congolese visionaries, leaders creating progress in business, education, health and culture to create sustainable jobs and a sustainable economy. We raise our voices to advocate for peace and to help end one of the deadliest wars of our time. The movement and coalition though builds upon the involvement and commitment of whistleblowers from all over the world, and this is where you come in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the start of the first NYC Whistler Society. We join a global network of local chapters dedicated to whistleblowing and together, we will start the conversation here in New York. We will develop innovative ways to get the attention of our community. We will support Congolese entrepreneurs through creating fundraising opportunities for their businesses and projects. We will wear our whistle as a symbol of peace. We will create a change.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Calling all whistle blowers!

Gnosis is the underlying principles hidden within every true science, philosophy, and mystical tradition. Gnosis is found within the mysteries of the Egyptian and Mayan ruins, within the art of the Greeks and Romans, within the stories of Buddha, Jesus, and Moses. Gnosis is as ancient as life itself and is not bound by any one culture, religion, or people. Classically, the teachings of Gnosis were hidden from the public and guarded by an elite priesthood in every civilization, however, due to the age in which we live, these teaching have been made public for all to know. Join us to discover, learn, and practice this profound science in order to reach your own Self- Realization and Liberation. Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering. We kindly welcome you to join us in the path of Self-Realization taught by so many Buddhas and Avatars before us. We teach in the tradition of Samael Aun Weor.

All I want to do is save some money while traveling with other Christians. I would go on one of those ministry trips, but they're really expensive since most of them are fundraisers. Not to mention the fact that we have to pay for their preachers and their entertainers. How about we keep things simple. Let's just pick a date to travel with our families to certain destinations. They have things for singles, alternative lifestyles, and every other group you can think of.&nbsp; So why not have something for Christian families? We can fellowship with one another while we're there, and have more fun than any entertainer can provide. We can do short trips, long trips, far trips, or close trips. We can even do something as simple and inexpensive as going to a state park together.&nbsp; Cruises are always fun too.

Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

This meetup will provide an opportunity for gay men with an interest in wine and food to meet each other and explore various categories of wine while dining out in New York BYOB restaurants. <br><\/p>\n<p> For each dinner meetup, a theme will be chosen and the wines will be provided by the host, who will disclose the identities of the wines (along with ratings, reviews, and prices) when the meetup is announced. The wines will be carefully chosen as good examples of their type and offer a good price-quality ratio. To facilitate dinner-table discussions and to ensure that everyone is able to taste and retaste all the wines, attendance will be capped at 10 men per dinner. To cover the cost of the wines, attendees will pay a fee when RSVPing. Then at the restaurant, each attendee will pay for whatever food he orders. <br><\/p>\n<p>I am the organizer of an identical (though not gay-specific) meetup group based in Westchester County. It has proven very successful over the past year, and it made me want to launch a New York City version just for gay men who have some knowledge of wine and want to expand their tasting experience and meet other guys who share their interest.

BPD is a stressful condition that causes great pain in the sufferer as well as the people who are closest to him\/her. Until recently, there's been a tendency for professionals to blame parents for their children's disorder, which further burdens family members. Parents need to find ways to maintain their equilibrium in order to help their struggling children. Partners and spouses of people with borderline personality often question whether they should stay in their relationships. Children whose parents have this disorder have complicated issues that carry over into adulthood.

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying.

Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task). The team has since continued in its commitment to the community by following its mission to foster the well-being of women from all backgrounds and all ages.

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game. Good sportsmanship will be emphasized. &nbsp;I'll do my best to take this club in the direction that the majority of members seem to want to go. I'll often ask for member input into various happenings in the club and I'll be receptive to ideas and criticisms by members regarding the club.

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to. I know how hard and lonely the journey can be, and wanted to create a group where anyone and everyone who might be going through their own ordeal can turn to for support. <\/p>\n<p>My hope is that we can become a family that grows together, and ultimately have an impact on each other\u2019s journeys.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186351000,"name":"Alan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/highres_254793575.jpeg","photo_id":254793575,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/member_254793575.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/thumb_254793575.jpeg"}},"members":71,"name":"Headaches, dizziness, anxiety and this thing I cant explain","id":18656568,"state":"NY","urlname":"thisthingicantexplain","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wanaque","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433737416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pagan","name":"Pagan","id":486},{"urlkey":"asatru","name":"Asatru","id":770},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"goddess","name":"Goddess","id":1052},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"drumcircle","name":"Drum Circle","id":2278},{"urlkey":"wiccan","name":"Wiccan","id":3862},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"heathen","name":"Heathen","id":15102},{"urlkey":"pagan-social","name":"Pagan Social","id":32452},{"urlkey":"earth-based-spirituality","name":"Earth-Based Spirituality","id":37479},{"urlkey":"everything-witchcraft","name":"Witchcraft","id":74176},{"urlkey":"norse-paganism","name":"Norse Paganism","id":89546},{"urlkey":"heathenry-or-heathenism-or-heathens","name":"Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens","id":102841},{"urlkey":"summer-solstice","name":"Summer Solstice","id":107023}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Pagans\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>New Jersey Pagans is the Largest Online and Offline Community in NJ We have been serving the community for over 15 yrs.

We are a running group supporting runners who are dealing with an injury or coming back to running after an injury.<\/p>\n<p> I know you don't want to be here... who would want to be injured instead of being out there running? Nobody! Unfortunately, the majority of the runners get injured at some point in their running career. I've got injured right after I started running 7 years ago. My Achilles tendon gave up on me. I was in a walking boot for&nbsp;several months followed by countless hours of PT sessions. It was painful, it was boring, and I felt shunned. I could not RUN!&nbsp;But in a way I was lucky. I met a girl who was a runner and&nbsp;injured as well. She had a stress fracture and she couldn't RUN either. We started to hang out and talk about our injuries, walk in Central Park instead of run,&nbsp;we discussed treatment options, our progress&nbsp;and plans after recovery. This was such a powerful bond between us: we are still best friends since and we are both recovered and running happy these days.<\/p>\n<p>You might want to find a similar place, or a friend who you can talk to about your injury and running and what the future holds for you. This is why this Meetup group was created. We welcome you here and we don't judge you. We understand that you are frustrated because of your injury and inability to do what you love the most: <strong>RUN<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to meet weekly and support each other. We can have discussions in a caf\u00e9 or we can have a slow stroll in the park. Whatever works! Come out, let's support each other in the recovery process, and before you know it, you will be back again&nbsp;in the park running!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founder of BIBSWITCH<\/p>\n<p><strong>BIBSWITCH<\/strong> - is an online platform that facilitates race number transfers between race organizers and runners who can no longer participate in an event they signed up for&nbsp;in advance.

Outside of yoga, I have a full time job that I love and a supportive group of love ones. On most days, I am happy, but just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to manage. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share the practice with you. Teaching and practicing yoga are my hobbies so some weeks, I might not have any class if other priorities take over. When that happens, I usually find a guest instructor to lead the class, or not schedule one. Don't let that stop you from your personal practice.

It is not simply acquiring business cards and adding names to your \u201cLinkedIn\u201d account \u2013 it is taking the time to getting to know people in the areas in which you are interested or want to learn more about and staying in touch with them throughout your career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2.

Create a platform to practice the soft skills in a conversational and friendly setting.

Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses. By being a member of the Network of Women in Business you will be able to increase your production and sales as a direct result of taking advantage of our training. You will be able to see a measurable difference in your bottom line. You will be able to say...\"Before I was on the Network my business was _____ and after joining the Network my business has increased by ____as a result of being on the Network.\"<\/p>\n<p>Never before has there existed an online space like the Network for Women in Business.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/highres_440579381.jpeg","photo_id":440579381,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/600_440579381.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/thumb_440579381.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182635110,"name":"Mary S Newman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/highres_241910158.jpeg","photo_id":241910158,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/member_241910158.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/thumb_241910158.jpeg"}},"members":69,"name":"NYC Small Biz Boot Camp for Women","id":18667861,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Small-Biz-Boot-Camp-for-Women","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434122250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"magento","name":"Magento","id":16390},{"urlkey":"internet-ecommerce","name":"E-Commerce","id":27954},{"urlkey":"magento-designers","name":"Magento Designers","id":123242},{"urlkey":"magento-developers","name":"Magento Developers","id":123243},{"urlkey":"magento-enterprise","name":"Magento Enterprise","id":128799},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-technology","name":"eCommerce Technology","id":132503},{"urlkey":"magento-meetups","name":"Magento Meetups","id":676752},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-marketing","name":"eCommerce Marketing","id":805252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Connecticut-Ecommerce-Meetup\/","rating":4.66,"description":"<p>This is a group for ecommerce enthusiasts focused on Magento and other major ecommerce platforms.

Cosmism is the best philosophical framework in which to conceptualize this journey.<\/p> \n<p>The ancient Greeks believed that Cosmos (as universal order) are ruled by the Logos, which is the principle of reason, world-law and measure. They also believed that man is microcosm, structured similarly and connected to the Cosmos through Logos accordingly. Early Russian cosmists proposed the idea of technological decompaction\/lightweighting of human body, which eventually wouldn\u2019t need an atmosphere and will be powered directly by solar energy. They call it \u201cradiant humanity\u201d - perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. <\/p> \n<p>Modern Cosmism brining to this doctrine ontological foundation, scientific structure and comprehension of possible technology. It's suggested that the profound nature of the reality is digital and it utilizes&nbsp; existential source code coming from Being which are using \u201cradiant humanity\u201d for its preserving and modification.&nbsp; Thus, we consider (for example) that Cosmological constant and precondition of Big Bang singularity were informationaly favorable mean guided. <\/p> \n<p>Cosmism will \u201cwork closely together\u201d with Transhumanism&nbsp; on transition period until consciousness uploading&nbsp; become possible. Then most likely humanity will be divided in two main directions: Earth base genetically improved biological civilization and departing digital society, creating new cosmic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/highres_439015680.jpeg","photo_id":439015680,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/600_439015680.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/thumb_439015680.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176456192,"name":"Vlad Bowen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/highres_245249871.jpeg","photo_id":245249871,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/member_245249871.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/thumb_245249871.jpeg"}},"members":114,"name":"Cosmism Meetup","id":18678518,"state":"NY","urlname":"Cosmism-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434549197000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"retire","name":"Retirement Planning","id":10026},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"financial-planning","name":"Financial Planning","id":15222},{"urlkey":"money","name":"Money","id":15580},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"retirees","name":"Retirees","id":20689},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"retired-men-and-women","name":"Retired Men and Women","id":49065}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wealth-Builders\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Welcome to New York Wealth Builder!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Are you worried that you will never achieve financial independence?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you spend more time planning your next vacation instead of your financial future?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Does thinking about your financial future cause you anxiety?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you look at your parents and tell yourself you better start planning now?&nbsp; <\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Most people do, which is why I wrote How to Avoid Bag Lady Syndrome: A Strong Woman's Guide to Financial Peace of Mind to help individuals achieve financial independence and take control of their financial world at an earlier stage in life.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>We plan to meet once a month to discuss any financial concerns or matters that are important to the group as a whole.

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

The St. Regis, the Peninsula, the Parker Meridien, the Four Seasons, the Plaza, the Ritz-Carlton, the Mandarin Oriental. On the East Side are the Pierre, the Plaza Athenee, the Surrey and the Carlyle. We'll certainly hit up the \"trendy\" hotels as well, among them the Standards, the Gansevoorts, the W's, and the Dreams.

Drinking, talking, having great conversations.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>I said that this was essentially a party meetup, but that's not quite correct.

In fact, since 1985, BNI members worldwide have exchanged over 15 Million business referrals, totaling over $8 Billion in new business.  In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business. ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Networking requires commitment. The most successful chapters of BNI are comprised of participants who are sincerely committed to helping one another through networking. They are a team. As a participant in BNI, you are responsible for complying with the policies and guidelines of the organization.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13744230,"name":"Joe Vaccarelli","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/highres_250343622.jpeg","photo_id":250343622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/member_250343622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/thumb_250343622.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"BNI Chapter 61","id":18701485,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Chapter-61","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Power Networkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435417153000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"communityorg","name":"Community Organizations","id":10485},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"community-gardening","name":"Community Gardening","id":74771},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Consciousness-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in food advocacy and promoting fairness across the board including supermarkets, restaurants, bars and even food trucks.
