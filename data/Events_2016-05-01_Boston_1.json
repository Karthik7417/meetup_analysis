After all bags have been thrown, a bag remaining on the board is worth 1 point. A bag that went in the hole is worth 3 points. Add up how many points you earned and compare them to your opponents. Equal points cancel each other out so that only one team can score per round. For example, if you scored 5 points and your opponent scored 3, you will add 2 points to your overall score and your team will throw first in the next round. If you scored 6 points and your opponent scored 6 as well, there will be no points awarded and whoever threw first in the last round will throw first again. A game is won when a team reaches 21 points with a lead of 2 or more points. The first team to win 2 games wins the match.<\/p> <p>Hopefully there will be field\u00a0space to\u00a0be a kids again and play some Kickball!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/f\/e\/600_448457150.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Questions or want my contact information (cell phone number in case you can't find our group\u00a0email: <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>\u00a0 Let's have some fun and be on the lookout for the next FWF event coming soon!<\/p> <p>Organizer assumes no liability either before, during, or after this event.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/funstuff40\/events\/229743095\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":14400000,"name":"FWF - Fun With Friends - Ashland State Park - Hike & Outdoor Games","id":"229743095","time":1460220300000,"updated":1460246833000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1159021038000,"name":"Fun Stuff","group_lon":-71.4300003052,"id":330793,"urlname":"funstuff40","group_lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Fun People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"915 Commonwealth Ave","name":"Boston University Fitness and Recreation Center","lon":-71.117569,"id":22166672,"lat":42.351425,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.5052819252,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454380115000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get the most out of this Spring with a fun season of Volleyball!\u00a0This league is all about meeting new people so don't worry at all if you're a rookie!\u00a0We place\u00a0competition on the backburner and encourages a relaxed, social atmosphere.

A provocative, genre-defying film as supernatural as it is intimately human, it follows a father, Roy (Michael Shannon), who goes on the run to protect his young son, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), a boy with mysterious powers that even Roy himself cannot comprehend.<\/p> <p>What starts as a race from religious extremists and local law enforcement quickly escalates to a nationwide manhunt involving the highest levels of the Federal Government. Risking everything, Roy is committed to helping Alton reach his ultimate purpose, whatever that might be and whatever it costs, in a story that takes audiences on a perilous journey from Texas to the Florida coast, while exploring the bonds of love and trust, and the nature of faith.<\/p> <p>\"Midnight Special's intriguing mysteries may not resolve themselves to every viewer's liking, but the journey is ambitious, entertaining, and terrifically acted.\"<\/p> <p>\"In his fourth feature,\u00a0Midnight Special, Jeff Nichols pays transporting homage to the rich tradition, spanning the late 1970s through the mid-'80s, of intelligent sci-fi emotionally grounded in relatable human dynamics. There's an explicit nod, in particular, to John Carpenter'sStarman, echoed even in the enveloping mood of David Wingo's driving electronic score. But this suspenseful, beautifully acted supernatural thriller is also very much of a piece with Nichols' overarching thematic concerns and stylistic approach\" - THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER<\/p> <p><br\/>After, we'll go to Pho Lemongrass for dinner and discussion.<\/p> <p>See you at the movie,<\/p> <p>John<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"John will gather the group AFTER close of credits on the sidewalk on the corner of the Coolidge Corner Theater.

Created in the early 1900s by artist and suffragist Blanche Ames and her botanist husband Oakes, Borderland offers many of the same pleasures that the Ames family enjoyed: walking and horseback riding on woodland trails, fishing and canoeing in the ponds, or, in winter, ice-skating and sledding.<\/p> <p>In 1906, Oakes Ames and his wife Blanche purchased land on the border of Sharon and Easton. The country estate they named \u201cBorderland\u201d remained in the family for 65 years. In 1971, two years after the death of Blanche Ames, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the estate and opened it as a state park. The family\u2019s home, a three-storey stone mansion built in 1910, still stands. Its twenty rooms are furnished much as they were when the Ameses lived here; many of Blanche Ames\u2019 paintings grace the walls.

The Central Square Theater in Cambridge is putting on Arcadia this spring.

Scandal. Stoppard.<\/p> <p>Derbyshire, England, 1809: A brilliant thirteen year-old, Lady Thomasina Coverly, proposes a scientific theory with implications well beyond her own understanding while her tutor, Septimus Hodge, engages in romantic entanglements with the lady of the house, among others. Simultaneously, present day academics Hannah and Bernard investigate the scandals of Sidley Park in the early 19th Century, including a mysterious visit from Lord Byron and an elusive character known as the Sidley Hermit. Praised as \"A play of wit, intellect, language, brio and.. emotion.. exhilarating!' by The New York Times, Tom Stoppard's Arcadia is a romantic and funny exploration of the heart, the sciences, and how history is mis-created.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Both the theater &amp; this playwright\/play\u2014which I saw once previously, many years ago\u2014are personal favorites, so I'm confident this will be a terrific show.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you haven't been to this theater before, it's intimate &amp; the tickets tend to be quite affordable (particularly relative to the performances of the two theater groups that perform there).<\/p> <p>I selected the 1st Sun. matinee [EDIT: now updated to the Sun. 4\/10 Sun. matinee to accommodate our Meetup group's lead organizer, Anna] in the run &amp; am posting this now (in Dec.) b\/c I just checked &amp; noticed that tickets go on sale beginning Dec. 31st.<\/p> <p><br\/>There's certainly no rush to get tickets; however, I note the on-sale date b\/c the theater offers discounts for groups of 10 or more, so if we happened to have that level of interest I'd be happy to contact the theater to find out how much the discount would be.<\/p> <p>Also, if there are fewer people interested, I often get email from the theater about discounted individual tickets, so I could try to pass that savings along to those who RSVP sometime closer to the date of the play.<\/p> <p><br\/>Finally, there are many great places to get a drink &amp;\/or some food after the play, all w\/in a block or two of the theater in Central Square. I'll bring a few suggestions &amp; then we can decide where to go as a group when we meet up after the play.\u00a0 (And, btw, please see the \"How to find us\" info I've added near the top of this posting, below the Meetup location.)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2014Cheers, Dave M.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Upon exiting the theater, look to your immediate left for me & the group in the theater's brick courtyard.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect.

Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

Sometimes called halotherapy chambers, the Salt Cave is designed to provide a relaxing experience with multiple healing benefits.<\/p> <p><br\/>Salt Cave therapy is a risk-free, non-invasive, natural treatment with no known side effects. The anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of this treatment can provide relief for a variety of health conditions including:<\/p> <p>Relief from respiratory ailments including allergies, sinus infections,\u00a0colds, Asthma, Bronchitis, and COPDHelp improve skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and eczemaCystic-fibrosis patients are experiencing \u201cless shortness of breath, less coughing and decreased sinus pressure.\u201d<\/p> <p>(New England Journal of Medicine)Reduce stress and improve sleep patterns Help with joint pain and stiffness<\/p> <p>Our cave has 18 tons of pink Himalayan salt \u2013 mined, custom cut, and shipped to New Hampshire. \u00a0We have tiled the walls of our cave with this special salt, and have also added a halogenerator which heats, crushes, and disperses micro-particles of the salt into the cave. The concentrations of salt particles can be adjusted for varying respiratory issues.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

NO EXCEPTIONS.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:<\/b><\/p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events. All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/230131693\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvgbpb","time":1460417400000,"updated":1460475597000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02459","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newton Centre","address_1":"796 Beacon Street","name":"Samadhi","lon":-71.193443,"id":15829882,"state":"MA","lat":42.330112,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":6.64732599258,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459712357000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meets every Monday evening from 7:30-8:30pm.\u00a0 We'll cover lots of topics in wellness and weight management as well as some mindfulness topics related to weight and eating psychology concepts.

Ambassador Shearer served in the Clinton Administration in the Commerce Department and then as Ambassador to Finland. He is the author of several books and publications, and his articles have appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the International Herald Tribune.<\/p> <p>Stephen M.

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.<\/p> <p>The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.

In this presentation, we introduce a micro service based platform that provides seamless web SSO integration using SAML or OAuth2, access control for applications and APIs behind a gateway. A SAML based identity provider supports not only enterprise SSO web integration, but also serves as the authentication provider for an OAuth2 server. This is a true SSO for both SAML based service providers and OAuth2 clients. The API gateway serves as an OAuth2 resource server to provide security for micro service behind it. \u00a0The platform uses Java and a few other languages and libraries, such as HTML5, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RDBMS, LDAP and Liquibase.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Brandon Chen<\/b><\/p> <p>Brandon Chen is a seasoned technologist with 16+ years experience in healthcare, telecommunication, and financial engineering sectors.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229763036\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"HEARTS NIGHT  with  Good Friends and Food in Medford","id":"229763036","time":1460498400000,"updated":1460561843000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01752","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Marlborough","address_1":"72 Jefferson St","name":"72 Jefferson St","lon":-71.555717,"id":13699472,"state":"Ma","lat":42.350674,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.8592662811,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457120072000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/1\/d\/600_447485917.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Free.

At the same time, traffic planning began to dominate planning at eye level, to address the rapid influx of cars into cities. The concern for the people using cities that had been maintained over centuries of tradition and experience was completely left behind. The idea of \"cities for people\" was overlooked and forgotten.<\/p> <p>In his lecture, Jan Gehl will summarize this history, which is laid out in his book Cities for People (Island Press, 2010), and go on to explain why looking after people is crucial for the quality of cities in the 21st century; how it can be accomplished; and how it is actually done now in many projects and cities. He will show how, after decades of neglect, \"cities for people\" is once again a central theme in architecture, urban design, and city planning; and how the transformations carried out by Gehl Architects in Copenhagen, Melbourne, Sydney, New York, Moscow, and other cities exemplify this new people oriented direction in planning.<\/p> <p>Jan Gehl began his practice in the early 1960s with a period of research on public space, supported by a grant from his university, which resulted in the book Life Between Buildings (1971). Focusing on the spaces between buildings, he developed an approach to urban design and planning, based on observation of life in public spaces, in particular the assessment and measurement of usage patterns and quality of life.<\/p> <p>Gehl is founder and senior advisor of the urban design consultancy Gehl Architects, with expertise in architecture, urban design, and city planning. With members who have backgrounds in architecture, urban design, sociology, anthropology, and cultural theory, the firm has made a name for itself with a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to urban planning that entails not only the application of urban design theory and ideology but also the use of data and analytical strategy. It has undertaken major improvement projects for cities, including Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Riga, Edinburgh, Perth (WA), Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Amman, Oman, Cape Town, London, New York and Moscow.<\/p> <p>Parallel to his firm\u2019s work, Jan Gehl has authored and coauthored various publications\u2014including New City Life (2006), Cities for People (2010), and How to Study Public Life (2013)\u2014in which he has further developed and shared his techniques of observation and analysis. He has taught at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen where, in 1998, he founded the Center for Public Space Research; he has also taught at universities in Edinburgh, Vilnius, Oslo, Toronto, Calgary, Melbourne, Perth, Berkeley, San Jos\u00e9, Guadalajara, and Capetown.<\/p> <p>Among many honors, Gehl has been awarded the International Union of Architects' Sir Patrick Abercrombie Prize for Exemplary Contributions to Town Planning, as well as honorary doctoral degrees from Universities in Edinburgh and Toronto. He is an honorary fellow of architectural institutes in Denmark, England (RIBA), USA, Canada, and Scotland, as well as the planning Institutes in Australia and Ireland. His work has been the subject of exhibitions at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (2012) and the Venice Architectural Biennale in 2008, 2012 and 2016.<\/p> <p>\u201cFirst life, then spaces, then buildings \u2013 the other way around never works.\u201d ~Jan Gehl<\/p> <p>Anyone requiring accessibility accommodations should contact the events office in advance at[masked] or [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast\/events\/229543344\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Livable Cities (HGSD)","id":"229543344","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460521206000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164140077000,"name":"The Cambridge Moveable Feast","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":370532,"urlname":"Cambridge-Moveable-Feast","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Citizens of the World"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":8,"distance":3.76958274841,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457887956000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be talking about a DNA copying technique that does not require heating-cooling cycles.<\/p> <p><br\/>The paper that we are going to discuss:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1249482\/pdf\/5-7400200.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1249482\/pdf\/5-7400200.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>The agenda for the journal club:<br\/>- Short overview of the paper to understand the scope of this work.<br\/>- Go over the paper figure by figure.

While the idea for ClickMedix started at MIT, the real discovery happened when Ting Shih went to test the idea of using mobile phones to deliver health care in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a lack of doctors, treatments, and over whelming number of patients. To date, ClickMedix has been deployed in 16 countries, in multiple languages and addresses a variety of disease from HIV\/AIDS to diabetes. The solution consists of tools for doctors, nurses, health workers, and patients, all \u201cpersonalized\u201d to the needs of each user.

Her areas of expertise include innovation strategy, product development, lean\/Six Sigma process improvement, operations management, organization change management, and business development.<\/p> <p>She spent three years as a founder of Click Diagnostics, a social enterprise born out of the MIT Media Lab, conducting mobile health projects and pilots in over ten countries in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and North America. She was integral to designing mobile health systems that can withstand unreliable or intermittent mobile network, while satisfying the varied needs of healthcare in underserved communities. She founded ClickMedix to build upon the success and learning from the three-year pilot of creating a highly reliable, secure, and user-friendly, HIPAA-compliant telehealth, disease management, and care coordination system that can be deployed quickly to health practitioners and connect patients with medical experts worldwide. Ting leads the design, development, and deployment efforts for ClickMedix\u2019s affordable mobile health and education system.<\/p> <p>Ting is named Toyota Mothers of Invention in 2015 and Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Awards Laureate in 2012 for North America.

So how do you design healthcare delivery tools that can be used by doctors and patients alike? ClickMedix took on the challenge of designing for global health to improve the lives of over 1 billion people using mobile phones in 2007. While the idea started at MIT, the real discovery happened when founder Ting Shih went to test the idea of using mobile phones to deliver health care in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a lack of doctors, treatments, and over whelming number of patients. To date, ClickMedix has been deployed in 16 countries, in multiple languages and addresses a variety of disease from HIV\/AIDS to diabetes. The solution consists of tools for doctors, nurses, health workers, and patients, all \"personalized\" to the needs of each user. During this session, Ting will share her journey and discovery for designing mobile-phone enabled solutions to deliver personalized care so that each patient can live better, healthier,\u00a0 and happier.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/uxboston\/events\/229473480\/","yes_rsvp_count":154,"duration":9000000,"name":"BostonCHI: Designing for Global Health by Personalizing Care Delivery.","id":"229473480","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460510179000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282493730000,"name":"UX Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1694880,"urlname":"uxboston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"UXers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Watertown","address_1":"74 Acton St","name":"Central Rock Climbing Gym","lon":-71.198532,"id":13269882,"state":"MA","lat":42.3694,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.60749197006,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453830585000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's climb at Central Rock Gym in Watertown!

We know now that anyone can learn to journey, to connect with their own helping guides and spirits in non- ordinary reality, in order to get answers to personal questions, solve problems, open creativity, see new ways of being in the world and obtain healing information for themselves and their community.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Join us with Trevor Stricker, of Disco Pixel, as he shares valuable lessons learned with Unity's new GUI system! Our host Akamai will once again be sponsoring pizza, beverages and the venue! Please RSVP to ensure enough food for all!<\/p> <p><br\/>So what's this about new GUI? Canvases, RectTransforms, and Layouts! Oh my! Unity has ditched OnGUI and come a long way towards the engine understanding that displays have different aspect ratios and pixel densities. But when your game logic wants to fill a scrollable list with inventory items, then your code needs to work with the GUI. What the editor shows in a RectTransform is totally different from the member variables. Layouts seem to love doing exactly the wrong thing without giving any warning about bogus values. The wrong things often end up drawing on top. This talk will delve into programming useful and slick GUI behavior into Unity\u2019s new GUI system.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/0\/4\/600_448343300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>Trevor started making games on the Dreamcast when games came on disks and people read about them in magazines printed on dead trees. He spent a decade making console games like NBA 2K and Panzer Dragoon Orta in roles from coffee fetcher to designer to lead programmer. He went indie in 2008, way before it was mainstream. He was in charge of development for Quickhit NFL Football, an early F2P online game that raised VC, signed the NFL, and sold to a publisher. After that he founded Disco Pixel where his love of rhythm games drummed up Jungle Rumble. It recently launched on PlayStation Vita and iOS, where it rose to the top of the music game charts in countries from the US to the Netherlands to Japan.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>***********************************<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please RSVP so we can ensure enough food and drinks for the attendees!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Our Sponsors:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/6\/600_442082646.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Thanks to our sponsors!\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unity3d.com\/\">Unity<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.akamai.com\/\">Akamai<\/a>\u00a0are generously sponsoring our meetup again this month.\u00a0<\/p> <p>See you there!\u00a0<br\/>- B.U.G.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/B-U-G-Boston-Unity-Group\/events\/229950803\/","yes_rsvp_count":112,"duration":10800000,"name":"uGUI Programming: Buttoning Up Unity in Code","id":"229950803","time":1460584800000,"updated":1460653487000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326904324000,"name":"[B.U.G.] Boston Unity Group","group_lon":-71.0800018311,"id":3125862,"urlname":"B-U-G-Boston-Unity-Group","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"Porter Square Shopping Center, 5 White St","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-71.118843,"id":24422925,"state":"MA","lat":42.388683,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":0,"distance":3.19160032272,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452282326000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Boston Traders' Meetup<\/b><\/p> <p>You are invited to attend the monthly Boston Traders' Meetup meetings.<\/p> <p>This week we will be discussing how trading fits within ones long term goals and some high level approaches to it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Any new members will have the chance to introduce themselves state the market that he or she trades and perhaps a very brief description of the approach taken.

Designers have embraced these innovations and \u201c#techstyle\u201d explores how the synergy between fashion and technology is not only changing the way designers design, but also the way people interact with their clothing. The exhibition draws on the MFA\u2019s collection of contemporary fashion and accessories, and features key pieces from innovators in the field including a digitally-printed dress from Alexander McQueen\u2019s Plato\u2019s Atlantis collection (Spring\/Summer 2010\/2011) and Iris van Herpen\u2019s 3-D printed dress (2013) produced in collaboration with MIT designer and assistant professor Neri Oxman.

Born Yasuhiro Wakabayashi in Shanghai to Japanese parents, he grew up in China and spent the years following WWII in Japan before coming to the US in 1954. Early in his career, Hiro worked as an assistant for the celebrated photographer Richard Avedon who, upon recognizing Hiro\u2019s talents, introduced him to Alexey Brodovitch, the legendary art director of\u00a0Harper\u2019s Bazaar.\u00a0By the early 1960s Hiro had become a widely admired figure in the field. His work was known for its originality and technical innovation, with bold uses of light and color, and an elegant sense of surrealism. This exhibition focuses on a selection of Hiro\u2019s fashion images that demonstrate how he applied his unique visual aesthetic to the work of fashion and jewelry designers such as Halston, Pierre Cardin, Harry Winston, and Elsa Peretti, among others. This will be the first solo exhibition of Hiro\u2019s work to be held in a major American\u00a0museum.<\/p> <p><br\/>Kenneth Paul Block illustrations<\/p> <p>December 12, 2015\u00a0\u2013\u00a0August 14, 2016<br\/>Clementine Brown Gallery (Gallery 170)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/mfas3.s3.amazonaws.com\/styles\/banner_grid-9_retina\/s3\/SC236167_4x3.jpg?itok=KiuEpmga\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mfas3.s3.amazonaws.com\/styles\/banner_grid-9_retina\/s3\/SC236167_4x3.jpg?itok=KiuEpmga<\/a><\/p> <p>Kenneth Paul Block (1925\u20132009) is arguably the most important fashion illustrator of the second half of the 20th century. His versatility and ability to create a graceful gesture or evoke the high energy of the post\u2013WWII generation make his work stand out among illustrators of his time. Throughout his career, mainly with\u00a0Women\u2019s Wear Daily\u00a0and\u00a0W Magazine, he chronicled fashionable designs and the lifestyles of the people who wore them. Blending illustration and portraiture, his drawings of figures like Jacqueline Kennedy, Babe Paley and Gloria Guinness capture the sophistication of the era\u2019s socialites and celebrities. This chronological survey contains approximately 30 works spanning Block\u2019s career from the 1950s into the 1990s\u2013\u2013drawing from the MFA\u2019s repository of Block\u2019s extensive archive of drawings.

How does this compare to SQL Server, the venerable boxed product so many DBAs have come to know and love? In this talk from long-time Azure MVP Bill Wilder, we will look at similarities and differences. We will also briefly talk about complementary data storage sources that may also interest DBAs.

Shifting from writing about code to writing\u00a0code is an amazing transition. It is challenging and rewarding in equal\u00a0measure. Now James takes a leadership role among three developers working\u00a0for a very young startup called Qubed Spaces.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Inside us and everywhere around us, life is vibrating. In fact, each of us has a personal vibration that accurately communicates who we are to the world and helps shape our reality.

It used to be hard to use the tools that safeguard your identity and your information online. You had to be a pretty technical person - the good news is that it has gotten easier to be secure in your online persona.<\/p> <p>These are some of the tools we will look at:<\/p> <p>1. Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging.<br\/>2. Email Encryption using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. There is also the GnuPG system here: <a href=\"https:\/\/emailselfdefense.fsf.org\/en\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/emailselfdefense.fsf.org\/en<\/a><br\/>3. Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity.<\/p> <p>There are also some great apps for secure texting and secure phones that provide end-to-end encryption for your calls, securing your conversations so that nobody can listen in. There is no way to be bulletproof, but knowing about the options available can provide a measure of security. It is ultimately up to you to decide how much security you want.<\/p> <p>Link to hangout: <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Business-and-Tech-Meetup\/events\/229930416\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":3600000,"name":"Virtual Meetup: Staying Safe - Overview of FREE Encryption Tools","id":"wzlsrlyvgbqb","time":1460674800000,"updated":1460679963000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427807422000,"name":"Boston Business & Tech Industry Meetup","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":18527653,"urlname":"Boston-Business-and-Tech-Meetup","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Tech Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Belmont","address_1":"Brighton Street and Pond Street","name":"Chad's Basement","lon":-71.159515,"id":24386246,"state":"MA","lat":42.397446,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.26132059097,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460305607000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>One exercise that sounds interesting goes as follows:<\/p> <p>One person plays until they settle on a groove.

While recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering make this work technically feasible, commercial success is hindered by the cost to develop the microbes. Development has been costly because the complexity and diversity of biology favored a labor-intensive, small-batch approach to engineering. Ginkgo has built a foundry that allows many microbial engineering projects to use shared processes in a high-throughput, largely-automated fashion, that unlocks substantial economies of scale. In this talk, I will outline the approach, custom software, and hardware that we use to allow flexibility and scale to co-exist where previously one came at the expense of the other.

How well we listen has a major impact on our work effectiveness, but the benefits extend far beyond professional and academic settings. Being a good listener fosters better-quality relationships with others, improved self-esteem and even better health and well-being. However, most people are not very good listeners and they are paying a price in their professional and personal lives.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Gallant\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Nature<\/i>\u00a0452,[masked] (20 March 2008)<\/p> <p>Abstract A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position\u00a0and object category\u00a0from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Reference 2:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cInverse retinotopy: Inferring the visual content of images from brain activation patterns\u201d<\/p> <p>Bertrand Thirion, et al<\/p> <p><i>NeuroImage<\/i>, Vol. 33, Issue 4, (2006)<\/p> <p>Abstract Traditional inference in neuroimaging consists in describing brain activations elicited and modulated by different kinds of stimuli. Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.unicog.org\/publications\/ThirionDehaene_InverseRetinotopy_Neuroimage2006.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.unicog.org\/publications\/ThirionDehaene_InverseRetinotopy_Neuroimage2006.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.unicog.org\/publications\/ThirionDehaene_InverseRetinotopy_Neuroimage2006.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Reference 3:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cDecoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain\u201d Yukiyasu Kamitani<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v8\/n5\/abs\/nn1444.html#a1\">1<\/a>\u00a0&amp; Frank Tong<\/p> <p><i>Nature Neuroscience\u00a0<\/i>8, 679 - 685 (2005)\u00a0<\/p> <p>Abstract The potential for human neuroimaging to read out the detailed contents of a person's mental state has yet to be fully explored. We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/philosophy-185\/events\/229718438\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Looking Inside a Person\u2019s Mind","id":"229718438","time":1460759400000,"updated":1460771922000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1159109925000,"name":"The Boston Philosophy of Mind Group","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":331299,"urlname":"philosophy-185","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Philosophers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Watertown","address_1":"74 Acton Street","lon":-71.198532,"phone":"(617) 744-0081","name":"Central Rock Gym","id":13991402,"state":"MA","lat":42.3694,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.60749197006,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460565195000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Make sure to bring your beer shoes for after.

Table tipping is a unique form of physical mediumship that allows participants to communicate with spirits through the use of small, round tipping tables. With the help of the spirits, these tables tip or tilt in order to form a communication of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers. The tables can also form a dialog between spirits and participants through tipping out letters of the alphabet. Tipping tables were heavily used in old Victorian spirit s\u00e9ances and events as a way to communicate with dearly departed souls.<br\/>Ron and Amy will discuss the history of table tipping, explain the energy of spirit vibrations and how it is used with the table, and provide a full demonstration of table tipping. Participants will then use provided tables to practice table tipping and communicate with spirits on the other-side.<br\/>This enchanted evening will be enjoyed with old Victorian style music and ambience.<br\/>Victorian dress is optional, but best dressed wins a prize!<br\/>The night will end with tea, pastries and conversation.<br\/>Unitarian Universalist Church, 6 Locke St, Andover, MA 01810, Friday, April 15th, 7-10pm<br\/>Cost for this event is $29 p\/p.

Desmond discusses Evicted: <b>Poverty and Profit in the American City<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is free and includes a book signing; no tickets are required.<\/p> <p>Friday, April 15th, 7pm<\/p> <p>Harvard Book Store - 1256 Mass. Ave., Cambridge<\/p> <p>Harvard Book Store welcomes John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University and co-director of the Justice and Poverty Project MATTHEW DESMOND for a discussion of his latest book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City.\u00a0<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>About Evicted: In this brilliant, heartbreaking book, Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind.<\/p> <p>The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, \u201cLove don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas.<\/p> <p>Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced \u00a0into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America\u2019s vast inequality\u2014and to people\u2019s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship.<\/p> <p>Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.Praise<\/p> <p>\u201cEvicted is astonishing\u2014a masterpiece of writing and research that fills a tremendous gap in our understanding of poverty. Taking us into some of America\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, Desmond illustrates how eviction leads to a cascade of events, often triggered by something as simple as a child throwing a snowball at a car, that can trap families in a cycle of poverty for years. Beautiful, harrowing, and deeply human, Evicted is a must read for anyone who cares about social justice in this country. I loved it.\u201d \u2014Rebecca Skloot, author of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u201cWritten with the vividness of a novel, [Evicted] offers a dark mirror of middle-class America\u2019s obsession with real estate, laying bare the workings of the low end of the market, where evictions have become just another part of an often lucrative business model.\u201d \u2014New York Times<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

It travels through 39 communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and is comprised primarily of the historic Mattabesett, Metacomet, and Monadnock (M-M-M) Trails.\u00a0 The route showcases classic New England landscape features: long distance vistas with rural towns as a backdrop, agrarian lands, un-fragmented forests, and large river valleys. The trail also travels through important Native American and colonial historical landmarks and highlights a range of diverse ecosystems and natural resources: trap-rock ridges, mountain summits, forested glades, vernal pools, lakes, streams and waterfalls.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/mmguide\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/mmguide\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/mmguide<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Not all sections of the M&amp;M\/NET Trail are presently passable and several sections north of Belchertown to the NH border follow paved roads.\u00a0 Most of these paved sections we\u2019ll skip.<\/p> <p>Most sections will be rated Easy\/Moderate to Moderate\/Difficult.\u00a0 Checkout the Difficulty Ratings I use at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/hikenewengland.com\/LegendRating.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hikenewengland.com\/LegendRating.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/hikenewengland.com\/LegendRating.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>And, as we\u2019ll be section hikers almost all sections will require car spotting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>On this first section we\u2019ll make our way to the summit of Grand Monadnock (trailhead to be determined) then head southeast on the M&amp;M Trail to RT 12 in Troy, NH.\u00a0 Total distance of 9 miles, difficulty rating of Moderate\/Difficult with an elevation gain of \u00a02000+\u2019.\u00a0 With car spotting expect to spend 7-8 hours with the group.<\/p> <p>Carpooling is welcome.\u00a0 If you would like to carpool you're welcome to post that request in the *Comments* section of this event's page.\u00a0 But please respond to those posts via *Meetup Messenger*.\u00a0 You do that by clicking on a member's profile, then clicking on *message*..<\/p> <p>Cell Phones and Electronic Devices:\u00a0<\/p> <p>I ask that while on the BSOT events that I host you limit your use of electronic devices to the following activities:<\/p> <p>Map My Hike or other Hiking Apps<\/p> <p>Location Services<\/p> <p>Cameras<\/p> <p>Weather Apps<\/p> <p>Of the many pleasant features of being out and about is that we all get away from the constant distractions of cell phones and electronics.\u00a0 I ask that while on the events I host you:<\/p> <p>Do not use your phone (of course!

Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.<\/p> <p>You need a recognizable facial photo as your profile picture in order to participate in this and all Trekkers events.<\/p> <p>Duration: Approximately 6+ hours. However, any time estimate given by an Event Organizer is just that. Actual times vary greatly according to weather, trail conditions and the group itself. Don't sign up if you've scheduled something later in the day. The Organizer is not responsible for getting you back in time.<\/p> <p>There is no way of knowing trail conditions ahead of time. Use your own judgment. Anyone with recurrent \"No Shows\" or about whom we have received complaints from fellow hikers will not be accepted. If you haven't hiked with us before, add yourself to the list if you can adhere to these basic prerequisites. Please don't RSVP \"Yes\" unless you really intend to come. We are committed to being there for you. If you are not equally committed to being there then please don't sign up.<\/p> <p>This hike is rated Moderate\/Difficult. \u00a0You should be able to stay with the group going at a pace of 2+ mph. This is a group event and participants are expected to follow the lead, stay together, stop at junctions or summits, and support all participants should circumstances require teamwork. We start together and finish together. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own. We hike in light rain or showers, but heavy snow or extreme cold weather cancels. Bring water, hiking boots (not sneakers), bug spray and lunch\/snacks. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.<\/p> <p>No dogs and no guests are allowed on hikes. Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please remember that your Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults. The people who have the best times on these hikes are those who stay loose and roll with things as they happen. If you are expecting Daniel Boone as your leader, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree (woof!). If you need everything to run perfectly, this hike is not for you.<\/p> <p>By clicking the \"Yes\" option on the RSVP link you are agreeing to the Liability Waiver as stated below:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember: Your Event Organizers are volunteers.

If there are more hikes on the calendar that means more people get to spend time out on the trails.<\/p> <p>I put together a brief summary of what we expect from organizers and what organizers can expect from the group, along with a step-by-step outline to plan a trip, but I thought the best way to find out what it's all about is to head out into the woods and figure it out.

While most of the route will be in the trees, the final section is above treeline.<\/p> <p>We will stop along the way and take\u00a0time at the summit to talk about what it's all about.

For a donation of $25 (per adult) at the door you'll be able to come and play for the full 8 hours, receive lunch and dinner, and be automatically entered into drawings for door pizes which will consist of board games on the \"Current Hotness\" list (at least 10 of them).<\/p> <p>There will be plenty of games available to play along with people to teach them, but also feel free to bring some of your own as well if there is something specific you would like to get to the table.<\/p> <p>There will also be other opportunities at the event, for small donations, to take home other game related prizes (like play to win, and possibly an auction).<\/p> <p>Meaghan and I, and her family, would very much appreciate your support. Our goal is to have at least 50 people come to the event, but the more the merrier of course! Please consider coming to hangout with friends, eat good food, play some games, maybe win some games, and have a fun day.<\/p> <p>Please share this with anyone you think might be interested.
