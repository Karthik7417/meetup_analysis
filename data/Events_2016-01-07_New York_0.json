Urban data opens up many new opportunities to improve cities and people\u2019s lives. In NYC, by integrating and analyzing data sets from multiple city agencies, the Bloomberg administration was able improve the success rate of inspections. A marked reduction in crime both in New York and Los Angeles has been in part attributed to data-driven policing. Policy changes have also been triggered by data-driven studies that, for example, showed correlations between foreclosures and increase in crime, the effects of subsidized housing on surrounding neighborhoods, and how low income households use the flexibility provided by vouchers to reach neighborhoods with high performing schools. But in each of these successes, the level of effort required to gather, integrate, analyze the relevant data, design and refine models, or develop and deploy apps, is staggering. Further as data volumes and data complexity continue to explode, these problems are only getting worse. In this talk, we will provide an overview of research in the development of new methods and systems for enabling interdisciplinary teams to better understand cities. We will also show some applications of our work.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio: \u00a0<\/b>Cl\u00e1udio Silva is a professor of computer science and engineering and data science at New York University.

The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

Based in New York, the company was founded in 2012 by Rie Yano and Jie Zheng, two friends who set out to help women feel confident about their wardrobe by providing a smarter way to shop. Material Wrld was built on the belief that the process of refreshing your closet should be fun and easy so your personal style can evolve right alongside your lifestyle.

An exiled poet named Ka returns to Turkey and travels to the forlorn city of Kars. His ostensible purpose is to report on a wave of suicides among religious girls forbidden to wear their head-scarves. But Ka is also drawn by his memories of the radiant Ipek, now recently divorced. Amid blanketing snowfall and universal suspicion, Ka finds himself pursued by figures ranging from Ipek\u2019s ex-husband to a charismatic terrorist. A lost gift returns with ecstatic suddenness. A theatrical evening climaxes in a massacre. And finding god may be the prelude to losing everything else. Touching, slyly comic, and humming with cerebral suspense, Snow is of immense relevance to our present moment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Editorial Reviews: <\/b><i>(from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0375706860\/ref=x_gr_w_glide_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_glide_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375706860&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2\">Amazon.com<\/a>)<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>From Publishers Weekly<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>A Turkish poet who spent 12 years as a political exile in Germany witnesses firsthand the clash between radical Islam and Western ideals in this enigmatically beautiful novel. Ka's reasons for visiting the small Turkish town of Kars are twofold: curiosity about the rash of suicides by young girls in the town and a hope to reconnect with \"the beautiful Ipek,\" whom he knew as a youth. But Kars is a tangle of poverty-stricken families, Kurdish separatists, political Islamists (including Ipek's spirited sister Kadife) and Ka finds himself making compromises with all in a desperate play for his own happiness. Ka encounters government officials, idealistic students, leftist theater groups and the charismatic and perhaps terroristic Blue while trying to convince Ipek to return to Germany with him; each conversation pits warring ideologies against each other and against Ka's own weary melancholy. Pamuk himself becomes an important character, as he describes his attempts to piece together \"what really happened\" in the few days his friend Ka spent in Kars, during which snow cuts off the town from the rest of the world and a bloody coup from an unexpected source hurtles toward a startling climax. Pamuk's sometimes exhaustive conversations and descriptions create a stark picture of a too-little-known part of the world, where politics, religion and even happiness can seem alternately all-consuming and irrelevant. A detached tone and some dogmatic abstractions make for tough reading, but Ka's rediscovery of God and poetry in a desolate place makes the novel's sadness profound and moving.<\/p> <p><br\/>Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After eight years spent living in exile in Frankfurt, Germany, the poet Ka returns to the isolated town of Kars during a historic blizzard. Cut off from the outside world, the town's ingrown tensions are thrown into sharp relief as Ka investigates the epidemic of suicides occurring among devoutly religious schoolgirls who prefer to take their own lives rather than remove their head scarves. The chaos of a military coup and Ka's sudden, obsessive love for an old, very beautiful friend contribute to the poet's sudden burst of creativity after a years-long bout of writer's block. Pamuk mixes elements of the fable, a heavy dose of metaphysics, and great swathes of artificial, stilted dialogue as he slowly, ever so slowly, parses the differences between the secular and the faithful. Strictly for determined readers with a passion for international literature and a familiarity with Islam. <i>Joanne Wilkinson<\/i><br\/><i>Copyright \u00a9 American Library Association.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/226189279\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"COSI - Master of the Rose Cross: Christmas has a Mystical Meaning","id":"fpbtflytqbkb","time":1449531000000,"updated":1449542584000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Mystics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"241 W 30th Street (West of 7th Ave)","address_2":"2nd Floor, Press 102","lon":-74.19864,"phone":"212-691-7690","name":"Edgar Cayce's A.R.E. of New York","id":5228282,"state":"NY","lat":40.73128,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.0211772919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445368163000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>These Psychic Development and Spirit contact classes are created for people who are passionate committed and sincere about developing their Intuition, Psychic abilities and contact with Spirit.<\/p> <p>If you have always believed you are psychic, or have seen and felt Spirit during your life, or you feel compelled to explore this part of yourself- you will love this class.

A popular class of CF algorithms is matrix factorization (MF). In this talk, Div will discuss an extremely simple class of MF algorithms known as Item Response Theory (IRT). Div will discuss methods to train IRT models using a combination of alternating minimization and gradient descent. Div will walk through the implementation of IRT modeling using numpy and pandas and also discuss how the implementation can be scaled to larger datasets using Apache Spark.For more details, check out the implementation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vats-div\/rasch_model\"><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vats-div\/rasch_model\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/vats-div\/rasch_model<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/p> <p><i>Biography: Div is a Data Scientist at Sailthru where he works on building data-driven solutions to help marketers be effective in reaching out to their users. \u00a0Before Sailthru, Div got his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University and did a postdoc at Rice University, where his research focused on the design, the analysis, and the application of machine learning algorithms.<\/i><\/p> <p>Image: Sailthru building entrance<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/5\/3\/600_444251859.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nBefore you attend, here is a preparation checklist:<\/p> <p>\n\n1. Sign up for a github account. This will allow us to more easily share code and collaborate together.

Join our <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/nydssg\">google mailing list<\/a>. This will allow you to access and contribute to the tutorial list that the group is working on. More importantly, this lets you team up with other students on tutorials that are interesting to you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our goal is to create a friendly and productive environment where we can build skills together with fellow data scientists. It doesn't matter if you use Python, R, or Excel, have 2 years of experience or 2 days, everyone is welcome to join. But to make it worth your time, check out the tutorial list FIRST. Pair up in a group if you see something interesting. Otherwise, add a tutorial so that others can join you.

We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We\u2019ll practice activities and learn warm-ups that will not only build confidence but also address that fear of public speaking.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u2015 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/9810.Albert_Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/theosophyhallnyc\/events\/227150365\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Secret Doctrine Discussion Group","id":"cftrhlytqbkb","time":1449534600000,"updated":1449550341000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434389406000,"name":"Theosophy Hall","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18674676,"urlname":"theosophyhallnyc","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Students"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"38 West 26th Street","name":"Flatiron Hall","lon":-73.990746,"id":14742532,"state":"Ne","lat":40.744259,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.399372220039,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437873386000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us and the NYC Trivia league every week for the best bar trivia in New York.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Our solar system turns out to be increasingly saturated with water. More than five million cubic kilometers of water ice have been identified on Mars, enough to cover the planet to a depth of thirty five meters. The Mars Ice House project taps into this vast supply of water ice to propose an autonomously 3d printed habitat for four explorers. The project has been awarded first place in NASA's Centennial Challenge Mars Habitat Competition, and is slated for a full scale prototype in the next phase.<\/p> <p>SEArch\u2019s collaboration builds upon a ten-year portfolio combining teaching and practice through academic space projects and research at Columbia University and Pratt Institute in association with the Human Factors division at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center (JSC). SEArch\u2019s collective work has made multiple presentations to international space and architectural symposiums and design programs Including: NASA\u2019s JSC Constellation Program (Ciardullo, Lents), participation on the 2015 Caltech Challenge winning design (Montes), and the 2016 X-HAB Innovation Challenge award for Human Centered: Designs for a Mars Transit Habitat at Pratt Institute (Morris), which evolved from his 2014 participation as an SME in the Net Habitable Volume Consensus Session for a Mars transit habitat for NASA in 2014.<\/p> <p>Clouds Architecture Office has produced a number of built and speculative projects distilled from research and analysis that explores the intersection between conceptual and experiential approaches to the built environment. Their work includes the publication of 'Third Sphere,' an article describing a suspended city based on the principle of the space elevator (Kerb Journal, 2012) and 'Comet Runner' which envisioned harnessing a comet for interplanetary exploration (Dezeen, 2015). In 2014, they were nominated for the Iakov Chernikhov Prize, and in 2015 Clouds AO received the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter Honor Award.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Nevins St. stop on 2,3,4 or 5 train","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Biohackers\/events\/227075333\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Talk: Mars Ice House: A new habitat design for the exploration of Mars","id":"227075333","time":1449534600000,"updated":1449551780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369658080000,"name":"Brooklyn Biohackers","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":8659672,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Biohackers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Biohackers, Geeks, DIYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Freeport","address_1":"130 E Merrick Rd","name":"Freeport Recreation Center","lon":-73.574677,"id":21484052,"lat":40.654503,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.7797584534,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448602893000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/7\/9\/600_439459833.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/8\/4\/600_439459844.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nStudent Testimonial:<\/p> <p>\"Bodhi meditation has a focus on healing energy, you can experience this at each session.

How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014 \u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

We've been at Mary O's for one full year and what a musically wonderful year it has been. With everyone's talent, commitment and deep good-heartedness we have bonded strongly and grown musically in ways that defy description.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We play and sing originals and covers. We play rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, 40's swing and so much more. We do songs in American English, British English, Japanese, Hindi, and Russian. Standing O to all of you. You make the group as special as it is.<\/p> <p>With this one year anniversary at Mary O's, and with so many new, talented people, I'd like to pull a few important sections out of our FAQ page for reference. We don't have many rules. What we do have is there for good reason: to help all of us have a great evening. So please take a couple of minutes to read the three sections below and take them to heart. It's important.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>Q. What are the rules of this open mic?<\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>We play up to two songs or 8 minutes, whichever comes first.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u2022\u00a0Be respectful of others and they'll return the favor.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Don't apologize on stage (or you will owe me a drink).\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Please no loopers,\u00a0iPad\u00a0backing tracks, fx boxes, extra amps, and stuff like that.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Please put $5 in the kitty to support the the Open Mic. \u00a0We have to pay fees\/dues to the parent MeetUp organization. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>Q. How does signup work?<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>The sheet gets put out at about 6:00PM. You sign up for a slot and playing starts by 7. We try very hard to get to everyone on the list so a lot of the rules we have are in the interests of that.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>PLEASE NOTE:<\/i> Because of the relatively small size of Mary O's, we can accommodate about 20 or so players. Please come come as early as you can to get on the list. Out of necessity the list gets closed when we max out our playing slots.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>Q. Is there a drink\/food minimum?\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Yes<\/b>.<\/i> <b>Mary O'Halloran requests that in return for hosting us, we return the favor by buying a minimum of two beers or two drinks, or a drink and something to eat. One cup of tea for the entire evening does not help Mary pay her rent.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The bar has plenty of great stuff to drink -- both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation.

Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired.

Because the behavior of an app is outside the control of a 3rd party SDK, multithreading can be a complex problem in any app as its behavior is outside of the control in your development efforts. Common problems from incorrect threading strategies include crashes, deadlocks, and unpredictable behavior. We will discuss threading strategies to avoid these problems.<\/p> <p>-- David Wood, CTO of Jun Group<\/p> <p><b><br\/>&gt;&gt; Presto \u2014 developing with gesture<br\/><\/b>Presto is an SDK for Android that can detect gestures like snaps, flicks and other hand movements, when a user is wearing a smartwatch.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 7 and 15 mini dates each lasting between four and eight minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>GET YOUR TICKETS AT THIS LINK: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/600_444658593.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>* There is a one drink minimum at the event.

In this biweekly series, we\u2019ll explore classic introductory Buddhist books.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 7 and 15 mini dates each lasting between four and eight minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p>GET YOUR TICKETS AT THIS LINK: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html<\/a><\/p> <p>* There is a one drink minimum at the event.

Note - lockers are quite small so if you have a lot of stuff or wear size 13 shoes like me, you may need to use two lockers - so bring two locks.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost:<\/b><br\/>Access to the ice skating rink is free, and so is the use of lockers (you need to bring your lock!).<br\/>However, the ice-skates rental is not free.<br\/>If you have a pair of ice skates, then you won't pay a dime; but if you do not have your own ice-skates, and can't borrow them from a friend\/relative, you'll have to rent them at the facility for $15 for a skating period (you can stay as long as you want 8AM-10PM).<br\/>If you plan on ice skating more than 2 times this season, I suggest you to purchase a pair of ice skates; there are some incredibly cheap skates out there - girls can pick up a pair for as low as $30...<br\/>Just make sure they fit you OK (thigh but not blistering tight), get the cheapest pair, and disregard all selling points salesman will try to put out there...<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Transportation:<\/b><br\/>Getting to the Bryant park is easy.<br\/>Take subway line B,D,F or M to the 42nd Street - Bryan park stop...<br\/>or 7 line to the 5th Ave stop...<br\/>or N, R, Q, 1, 2 or 3 line to the Times Square - 42nd Street stop and walk one Ave block east.<br\/>The entrance to the ice skating rink is from the south side of the park - 40th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues.<\/p> <p><b>What to wear:<\/b><br\/>What usually works best for me is a base layer top (thin, body tight, moisture wick shirt) with a warm sweater on the top, a scarf, a warm hat, and a pair of gloves; everything else stays in the locker - it could be a bit cold at first, but as soon as you start skating you'll start rolling your sleeves up; Again, this is what works for me - you may want to adjust the amount\/type of clothing to best fit your needs.<br\/>Cell phones are not permitted on the ice - if you need to make a call\/send text, you have to step off the ice.<\/p> <p><b>Checking in:<\/b><br\/>When you enter the facility you will be directed to the counter where they will ask you if you have your own skates or if you need to rent a pair, ask you to sign a waiver and give you a bracelet.<br\/>After you get the bracelet, you can proceed to the lockers area.<br\/>There are some snacks\/drinks sold at the facility but the prices are as they usually are in places like this...I recommend bringing a bottle of water\/drink and keeping it in your locker...<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/6\/8\/600_206601352.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities; per Meetup.com's Terms of Service Agreements, organizers and hike\/trip leaders are released from any and all forms of liability related to events.Full text of our liability waiver can be found on the following page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/events\/227259501\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Ice Skating @ Bryant Park *All Levels Welcome*","id":"227259501","time":1449703800000,"updated":1449715412000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1357706438000,"name":"Adventure Outlet","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6566782,"urlname":"Adventure-Outlet","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"221 W 38th Street","name":"Tagine","lon":-73.989494,"id":22007252,"state":"NY","lat":40.754055,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.281905472279,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448934357000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Speed Dating - Ages 35 to 49 (Must Pre Pay Online)<\/b><\/p> <p>Get Full Event Details &amp; Sign Up At: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html<\/a><\/p> <p>When: Wednesday, December 9th, 2015<br\/>6:30 PM - 8:30 PM (Check in at 6:20)<br\/>Where: Tagine Lounge\u00a0 (221 West 38th St.New York, NY - Between 7th &amp; 8th Ave)<\/p> <p>PRICE: $34\u00a0 (Must Pre-Pay Online.

Humanity has continued to set these laws into creative motion through thoughts, prayers, motives, intentions, voices, and beliefs.\u00a0These are the right tools. In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true-all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work.

To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/226898577\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytqbmb","time":1449705600000,"updated":1449719557000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.09785294533,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449430299000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Everyone! \u00a0<\/p> <p>Our next hangout will be on Wed., Dec. 9th at 7pm at The Brass Rail. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hbkn-Hangout\/events\/227253866\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Wednesday Hangout","id":"227253866","time":1449705600000,"updated":1449718124000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1448852450000,"name":"Hbkn Hangout","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":19166910,"urlname":"Hbkn-Hangout","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"See Ticket For Address","name":"Greenwich Village","lon":-74.005943,"id":24240313,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449172710000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/2\/c\/600_444717644.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>More info and tickets: <a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/k6R2R5\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/goo.gl\/k6R2R5<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Learn how to make three delicious pizzas that you probably never had before.

Spirit Education Trust, the most feared unit is Unit 3\u2014innocuously called Light Wines.\u00a0 This unit covers all the wines of the world that are neither sparkling nor fortified, and it concludes with a two-part exam, essays and blind tasting.\u00a0 It\u2019s daunting to try to study for this test, since it covers such an immense range of material.\u00a0 The first time I took the Unit 3 exam, I passed blind tasting with merit, but fell short in the essay part.\u00a0 I needed to retake it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In the essay exam, there is one compulsory question, then you are given six topics from which you choose four to write essays on.\u00a0 The second time I took the essay exam, I was torn between two topics\u2014Puglia (the heel of Italy\u2019s boot), and a comparison of M\u00e2con and Beaujolais.\u00a0 Given that I\u2019m a rabid Francophile, the latter topic was surely the natural choice for me.\u00a0 But no, I took a shot at Puglia.\u00a0 I passed the exam overall, but failed the Puglia question.\u00a0 This has haunted me ever since.\u00a0 <i>Why didn\u2019t I write about M\u00e2con and Beaujolais?<\/i>\u00a0 <i>I could have nailed it!<\/i>\u00a0 So, better late than never, I\u2019ll do it now.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Often overlooked in favor of the more prestigious C\u00f4te d\u2019Or to the north, M\u00e2con and Beaujolais are Burgundy\u2019s southernmost areas.\u00a0 (Although the wines of Beaujolais are so distinctive that it is often considered its own region, entirely separate from Burgundy.)\u00a0 Both are prolific regions that can offer excellent value in French wine, especially if one is looking for pure, ripe expressions of Chardonnay fruit.<\/p> <p>Unlike the densely planted strip of vineyards that make up the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, vineyards in the M\u00e2connais region are spread out over rolling hillsides, interspersed with other forms of agriculture.\u00a0 But as in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, the soils are limestone-based and favorable to Chardonnay.\u00a0 Ninety percent of M\u00e2connais wine is white, made in quantities that are three times greater than the white-wine production of the rest of Burgundy combined.\u00a0 \u00a0M\u00e2con enjoys warmer, drier weather than the Cote d\u2019Or, and the Chardonnay fruit ripens earlier.\u00a0 Much of the production is unoaked, and offers refreshing bright fruit and minerality.\u00a0 When people tell me they don\u2019t like Chardonnay, I assume they have in mind heavy-handed California oak bombs and often suggest they try a M\u00e2con.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One step up from the basic M\u00e2con appellation is M\u00e2con-Villages, in which names of particular villages with favorable vineyard sites can be appended to the appellation name.\u00a0 Other M\u00e2con appellations include St-V\u00e9ran, in the southern end of the M\u00e2connais, where the wines have stone fruit and floral notes with flinty minerality.\u00a0 The most famous M\u00e2con appellation is Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9, also in the southern M\u00e2connais, in the shadow of the Solutr\u00e9 and Vergisson crags, which mark the end of Burgundy\u2019s limestone ridge.\u00a0 Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 enjoyed a faddish popularity back in the \u201870s (no, I wasn\u2019t drinking back then), then fell into disfavor in subsequent decades (possibly from overproduction, rising prices, and a decline in quality).\u00a0 But there are outstanding examples of Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9\u2014full bodied with a good balance of acid, fruit, and mineral, with some well-applied oak.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Small amounts of red M\u00e2con are made, from Pinot Noir and (more commonly now) Gamay.\u00a0 These can be hard to find but are worth seeking out.\u00a0 The examples I\u2019ve tried have had a nice peppery quality along with that bright Gamay fruit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be trying three M\u00e2con Chardonnays from three different vintages, which will give us an idea of how well these wines age:\u00a0 from 2009, a <i>Villages<\/i> wine from M\u00e2con-Cruzille; an old-vines Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 from 2011; and from 2013, another old-vines Chardonnay from prestige producer Thevenet in St-V\u00e9ran.\u00a0 Plus a M\u00e2con Rouge from 2013 by the same maker as the wine from M\u00e2con-Cruzille.<\/p> <p>Just south of M\u00e2con is the Beaujolais region, where Burgundian limestone gives way to granite soils, favorable to the Gamay grape.\u00a0 Beaujolais is synonymous with easy-drinking, low-tannin, fruity reds, meant to be drunk young.\u00a0 Much is produced through the carbonic maceration method, in which whole, uncrushed grapes are sealed in a tank with CO2, promoting spontaneous fermentation of a brightly fruity, low-tannin wine.\u00a0 The best Beaujolais comes from the ten <i>cru<\/i> appellations in the granite hills of northern Beaujolais, where increasingly serious winemaking is taking place.\u00a0 Cru Beaujolais is vinified with traditional maceration and pressing, often followed by cask aging.\u00a0 The best examples are ageworthy wines that can compete with Burgundy Pinot Noirs.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Small amounts of Chardonnay-based Beaujolais Blanc are made, in the northern part of the region that practically overlaps with M\u00e2con and shares its limestone soil.<\/p> <p>We will be trying two <i>cru<\/i> Beaujolais from Morgon and Fleurie, both made by the star winemakers within their respective appellations.\u00a0 Plus a Beaujolais Blanc made by noted winemaker Jean-Paul Brun, using indigenous yeast and low sulfites.<\/p> <p>For a tasting featuring fruit-forward whites and low-tannin reds, I thought we\u2019d return to Sushi Thai in Tarrytown, where the pan-Asian menu should be a good match for the wines.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/sushithaitarrytown.com\/home\/2520243\"><a href=\"http:\/\/sushithaitarrytown.com\/home\/2520243\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/sushithaitarrytown.com\/home\/2520243<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>So maybe the next theme should be Puglia . . .<\/p> <p><b>2009 Domaine Guillot-Broux M\u00e2con-Cruzille Les Perri\u00e8res\u00a0 $33<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.\u00a0 From the winemaker:<\/i> \u201cThe soil of the Perri\u00e8res is difficult to work and very fragile. The vineyard was abandoned after the phylloxera epidemic for these very reasons. However, the wine produced is wonderfully lively and very mineral. It needs at least two or three years after being bottled to start hinting at its true colours.\u00a0 Since 2001, the wine has been aged for 18 months in second or third generation oak barrels without either fining or filtering.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2011 Olivier Merlin Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 Clos des Quarts\u00a0 $45<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 Clos des Quarts is from the Chartre part of the vineyard immediately above Pouilly-Vinzelles populated by many vines planted way back in 1917. It reveals hints of white truffle and marzipan on the beautifully defined nose that blossoms with aeration. The palate is elegant and refined; not powerful but exuding finesse with hints of white peach and honeycomb on the long finish. Outstanding.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Domaine Thevenet St-V\u00e9ran Clos de l\u2019Ermitage Vieilles Vignes\u00a0 $24<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.\u00a0 From the importer:<\/i> \u201cThis \u2018prestige\u2019 cuv\u00e9e is produced from the oldest vines in a five-hectare parcel exploited entirely as a \u2018monopole\u2019 by the Thevenet family.\u00a0 The average age of the south-facing Chardonnay vines located in Priss\u00e9 are seventy years old.\u00a0 This highly concentrated wine of limited production (about 12,000 bottles per year are produced) is aged in cuve (no oak aging).\u00a0 It displays a powerful constitution with great density; it is marked also by notes of tilleul and jasmine in the bouquet and hints of pear in its flavor.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2013 Jean-Paul Brun Beaujolais Blanc Terres Dor\u00e9es\u00a0 $21<\/b><\/p> <p><i>View from the Cellar 89<\/i> \u2013 \u201cJean-Paul Brun\u2019s 2013 Beaujolais Blanc is a very pretty example of the vintage and a fine bottle of Chardonnay, as it offers up a soil-driven nose of apple, peach, gentle leesy tones, a lovely base of stony soil, white flowers and a bit of citrus peel. On the palate the wine is deep, full-bodied and complex, with a good core, sound acids, very good focus and balance and a long, classy finish. This is every bit as satisfying as many a top M\u00e2con and sells for far less, making it a lovely value.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2013 Jean Foillard Morgon C\u00f4te de Py\u00a0 $38<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 \u201cThe 2013 Morgon C\u00f4te de Py has an enticing bouquet of strawberry pastilles, cranberry and light floral scents intermingling with vanilla. The palate is medium-bodied, with precise tannin on the tart cherry entry. There is plenty of tension and race in this Morgon with its lifted red fruit, though it finishes showing some youthful feistiness and needs another 18 to 24 months to calm down. Still, this is a very fine Morgon from Jean Foillard.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2013 Clos de la Roilette Fleurie Griffe du Marquis\u00a0 $37<\/b><\/p> <p><i>View from the Cellar 92+<\/i> \u2013 The precise and complex nose wafts from the glass in a bright, detailed, but notably weedy blend of cherries, pomegranate, pepper, a superb base of dark soil, plenty of herb tones, vinesmoke and a touch of nutskin in the upper register. On the palate the wine is full-bodied, tightly-knit and laser-like in its focus, with a very good core, moderate tannins, tangy acids and outstanding length and grip on the very well-balanced and youthful finish.

Quite the opposite \u2026 everything can start looking like a problem, and feelings of discouragement and conflict arise naturally. Using Buddha\u2019s insights into the nature of the mind and our reality, and guiding us in peaceful and creative meditations, Kelsang Dechok will show us that these limited views of our reality are in fact wrong. By learning to let go of this narrow sense of our self and our life, we can learn to connect with the joyful dimension of our being as well as deepening our connections to others\u2019 hearts. This in particular will open us to a new way of seeing our place in the universe. We can learn to step out of our limited misapprehension and into a joyful and naturally solution-oriented enlightened perspective. We will be able to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful life!\u201d And we will be able to bring that wonderful sense of being into the lives as others as well.<\/p> <p>Everyone is welcome.

Every self development system currently in the world is based on the GENERAL MIND outside of you.<br\/>Thursday December 10 there is a Free 45 minute Seminar about this New Dimension for self-evolution beyond the limits of GENERAL MIND.<br\/>Below are student experiences using one Cognitive App (Unfolding Your Mind) from this new Self-evolution OPERATING SYTEM.\u00a0 We have over 20 Cognitive App, you never learned in the world of the GENERAL MIND.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ruel<\/p> <p>We learned a new set of steps called the unfolding your mind process. Using this process in-workshop, each of us was given the opportunity to first uncloak the invisible shields that have been keeping us from gaining competence specifically in the relationships, but applicable to any discipline in life, and then we learned a new \"mind structure\" to take its place. Next, we each got a chance to begin an ongoing and FUN process of stabilization of this new structure by way of simulation. It was actually FUN to be able to see for the first time that which had been uncontrollable due to its invisibility, BUT ALSO, to see how unfolding our minds allowed us to self express in class in ways that we could not, even earlier in the same class in some of our cases. I think this is the missing pre-requisite for any current, past or would be Linker who has had any difficulty achieving anything, including Linkup in the past. I'm EXCITED about the possibilities with this new training method!Like \u00b7 Reply \u00b7 37m ago \u00b7 Mute<\/p> <p>sujit<\/p> <p>Unfolding your mind for using \"cognitive control mechanics\" is unlike any of the self command workshops I've attended in the past (they were great but some of us postponed using them). James knows how lazy some of us are and I think that's why he designed the next generation of cognitive control mechanics \"Unfolding your mind\". Today's workshop was for people who aren't using the tools they learn in class (can be applied to other areas of life too). We were given a process to actually allow and motivate to use the tools everyday. We also tried using one of the previous tools and totally blown away how our minds shifted and ideas were flowing with ease. Excuses and limiting thoughts disappeared. Time for old students to come back if they aren't making full use of\/stopped using the tools they have.Like \u00b7 Reply \u00b7 Yesterday \u00b7 Mute<\/p> <p>Matthew<\/p> <p>How many times have you pointed fingers at something or a system that does not work because you did not get quality results IF any results at all?? How many times have you blamed Another or said to yourself that it is too good to be true?Instead of wondering why or living in a world of constant blame maybe it is time to learn a process that will unfold your mind and bring you every result you want!!!James has simplified the process to a point that everyone can follow the clear step by step instructions and results can be achieved immediately in any given situation! Better yet, we are individually helped to make sure we have a crystal clear understanding of this awesome technology and apply it with great success. No other instructor can say that about their students and no other group can consider themselves a community! We are real people getting real results so now is the time to get off the fence, join us and live a life better than you imagined!Like \u00b7 Reply \u00b7 Yesterday \u00b7 Mute<\/p> <p>Domenico<\/p> <p>Unfolding Your Mind easily revealed technologies on how to powerfully move away from your old reality frames that keep you stuck from achieving your goals that you really want in life.<br\/>This is far more powerful then any Self development stuff I have read. Because at theFundamental level no matter how much stuff you read if you first dont know how to getout of your mind maze that keeps you trapped you can never make the changes thatyou need to move forward<\/p> <p>Dinesh<\/p> <p>Unfolding your mind is a new start for me. many times in my earlier efforts, I always wondered why I am not doing good in using tools like moving mental process, verbal idea projection and now James by unfolding your mind is making me aware of my reality frames.As long as we don't deal with our existing reality frames, not much progress can be made with existing tools and stuff we learned earlier. I recommend folks to try this esp those who still not comfy using stuff we already learned and still feel we not making progress.1 \u00b7 Like \u00b7 Reply \u00b7 April 19 \u00b7 Mute<\/p> <p>Matthew<\/p> <p>In the past 2 months we learned how to control our emotions to work in our favor then we Unfolded our Minds to get past our road blocks and learn processes like never before. Now we are building new lives and new realities, both personally and professionally!
