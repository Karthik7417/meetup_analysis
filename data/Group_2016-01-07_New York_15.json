What that means is that we'll be planning meet-ups once a month at a local bookstore, game shop or public library so we can talk about some game or games that we've all been playing for that month! This is meant to be a relaxing, casual get-together where you can meet new people, share a common interest with new friends, and maybe even learn some new things about your favorite game(s)!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do ask that everyone signing up for the group have a clear picture of themselves on their profile so that we can recognize members for each meetup.

To witness each other and to be seen, so that we can move through the world as our most authentic selves.

After all, establishing connections and building relationships shouldn't be about sales pitches or propositions, rather, what did you actually learn from the other person and how can you help them as well.<\/p>\n<p>We will offer a variety of events throughout the year that primarily focus on the problems startups and entrepreneurs face.

We have been looking for an indoor place to play during winter, and now I was able to secure one night a week at the NYACK YMCA gym for an adult indoor soccer class. Games would be Thursdays nights from 8:15 pm to 10 pm. Games will be 5 a side. If there's more than 10 people we'll form three or four teams, to a limit of 20 people per night. Now, if you want to play you'll need to become a YMCA member, if you are not one already. You can see the membership rates here: http:\/\/www.rocklandymca.org\/main\/benefits-rates\/ If you are an adult you'll pay $58 a month, and you can play soccer once a week, so you are paying $14.50 a game, plus you can use the whole YMCA (swimming pool, weights gym, yoga, etc). If you do the family plan you'll pay $84 for wife and kids. If we get at least 8 new members the YMCA will waive the signing fee for us and give us priority to sign up for the soccer class. Keep in mind that once the soccer class is open a lot of people that are already members who will want to sign up, and places are limited. I need please an answer before this Friday, Jan 8. Places are limited. Act fast!!","lon":-73.9300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":144782992,"name":"Flavio De Roma Leao","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/0\/highres_252603568.jpeg","photo_id":252603568,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/0\/member_252603568.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/0\/thumb_252603568.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Nyack Soccer Meetup - YMCA","id":19282458,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nyack-Soccer-Meetup-YMCA","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":41.0900001526,"who":"Indoor soccer players"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452003801000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"babyboomer","name":"Baby Boomers","id":2611},{"urlkey":"seniors","name":"Seniors","id":4107},{"urlkey":"over-50","name":"Over 50","id":16559},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camp","name":"Fitness Boot Camp","id":20087},{"urlkey":"seniors-social","name":"Seniors Social","id":26631},{"urlkey":"over-60-social-club","name":"Over 60+ Social Club","id":38771},{"urlkey":"senior-and-elder-care","name":"Senior and Elder Care","id":41157},{"urlkey":"aging-parent-caretakers","name":"Aging Parent Caretakers","id":67120},{"urlkey":"active-seniors","name":"Active Seniors","id":87006},{"urlkey":"adults-taking-care-of-aging-parents","name":"Adults Taking Care of Aging Parents","id":96646},{"urlkey":"bootcamp-fitness-class","name":"Bootcamp fitness class","id":104576},{"urlkey":"coping-with-caregiver-stress","name":"Coping with Caregiver Stress","id":109706}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Senior-Fitness-For-Your-Life-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Want to make this the year when you finally start taking as good care of yourself, as you have everyone else in your life?

I am trying to start a writing group for aspiring writers who live within 10-mile radius of Fort Lee. There are a few established writing meetups in New Jersey but the closest one is 30 miles away. Therefore, I am trying to see if I can organize a group of writers closer to home. All age and experiences are welcome I've looked at some other writer's groups and this is the problem that I have with them: 1. There are some writing meetups that you show up and you write. I think that's pretty dumb because I can write at home, why would I travel to a meetup to write? 2. There are other meetups that take place in people's private homes because they don't have a regular location. This gets pretty confusing because I'll be going to a new house at every meetup. 3. There are some meetups that limit the work that we can bring to 2 pages or 1000 words. This is pointless because my shortest work is 5 pages long. 4. Most other writers\u2019 meetups are non-critiquing. What's the point of going to a writer's meetup if you can't get any feedback? Therefore, my meetup will be a constructive critiquing meetup at a regular location (Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, or similar style coffee shops) every week. The suggested limit on the work is anything from a minimum of 1000 words (roughly 2 pages, single space, font size 11) to a maximum of 2500 words (roughly 5 pages, single space, font size 11). Each member will check the RSVP page before coming and bring enough copies for the number of people going. We will meet on every Saturday at a given time. Members will be required to buy a cup of coffee or pastry at the location since it is for paying customers only.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":95726052,"name":"James Shen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/highres_252502460.jpeg","photo_id":252502460,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/member_252502460.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/thumb_252502460.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Fort Lee Book writing Meetup","id":19284021,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Fort-Lee-Book-writing-Meetup","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"aspiring writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452024052000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/I-Love-Staten-Island\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>This group is for those who appreciate all that Staten Island has to offer.
