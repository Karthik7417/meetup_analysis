It clears blockages in our energy channels so that our physical body can be healthier. The practitioner does not use his\/her energy, but is just a channel through which the energy flows. Reiki Tummo goes beyond traditional Reiki in that it is not just a healing modality, but also helps us to grow spiritually by opening our spiritual heart which is our connection to the Creator. Reiki Tummo also uses kundalini and earth energy for a deeper and gentler acceleration of cleansing and spiritual growth.<\/p> <p><i>What else do I need to know?<\/i><\/p> <p>Donations are gratefully accepted, but if you can't donate please feel free to come.

This is a Saturday afternoon of tabletop gaming, welcome to all. RSVP as soon as you can commit, because space is limited to 30 people!<\/p> <p>If you haven't attended our other meetups, you can expect to play tabletop games of all sorts; examples include Carcassonne, The Resistance, Castles of Burgundy, Settlers of Catan, Lords of Waterdeep, Agricola, Through the Ages, Magic the Gathering, etc. Feel free to bring any games that you'd like to play with other Uptown Gamers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our group is renting this space, so, unlike our other meetups to date, I will have to collect an 8 dollar contribution upon attendance. This will be a good venue for our group because we will not feel obligated to buy food or drinks as we do when we have events at bars\/restaurants.

His first three novels (This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby) and several of\u00a0his short stories took place in Jazz Age New York and the bars, clubs and hotels he frequented were practically characters in his works.

Do they challenge your protagonist?<\/p> <p>* Formatting a script: How many acts is a screenplay? How many pages? Where does the inciting incident come into play?<\/p> <p>* The First 5 Pages: Do your first 5 pages excite the reader to continue to read?<\/p> <p>* The World: Is the world of you story coming through?

Every musical and dramatic work takes its audience on a journey, generally consisting of the following elements:<\/p> <p>1-) Introduction and elaboration: The central melodic theme is introduced and often repeated, in identical fashion or with variation. The mood of the piece is presented and established via use of dynamics, tempo and melodic arc.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> draw in the audience at this point, either with a compelling narrative subtext, or strong emotional message. Also, the performer must build gradual tension (when applicable), leading the audience to the musical <i>climax<\/i>.<\/p> <p>2-) Climax: The highest emotional point of the work, usually occurring 2\/3 to \u00be into the piece. Requires maximum expression and melodic emphasis to evoke a desired reaction or response from the audience. Also considered a reward point, or tension release for the audience.<\/p> <p><i>The performer should<\/i> fully understand the climactic point of the piece, and clearly highlight this point via the use of tone, dynamic expression and musical touch. The importance of the climax for audience understanding and satisfaction cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>3-) Resolution: The conclusion of the piece, during which all unresolved musical elements are resolved in a decisive manner.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> prepare the audience for the eventual end of the musical journey, a return to reality. Musical cues which aid this transition include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 gradual decrescendo and diminuendo<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 a clear a decisive \u00a0end point , so as to not leave the audience with an uneasy feeling of something unresolved<\/p> <p>Entertain your audience: Great entertainers (actors, singers, etc.) put their unique personality into every performance. If you want to make a memorable impression upon your audience, introduce a new, unique perspective on your piece. Once you truly own your piece, it should carry the inimitable stamp of your personality, but also <i>sound as if it is being performed for the first time<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Select pieces that are personally meaningful to you, and allow for your maximum expression as both performer and entertainer.<\/p> <p>Performances do not have to be memorized, or note-perfect. However, as a courtesy to your audience, please present a work that you have studied attentively, and can play to its completion.<\/p> <p>If you make a mistake during your performance, <i>please continue to play without stopping<\/i>. Apologizing, repeating a previously played section, or stopping will only call more attention to your mistake.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"website: www.nycclassical.com, email: acma@nycclassical.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/classical-139\/events\/224779727\/","yes_rsvp_count":28,"duration":7200000,"name":"ACMA September 2015 Concert","id":"224779727","time":1442692800000,"updated":1443265622000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202513261000,"name":"Amateur Classical Musicians Association","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1001619,"urlname":"classical-139","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Classical Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"114 Smith Street","name":"Konditori","lon":-73.98996,"id":23889236,"state":"NY","lat":40.687878,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":4.30111169815,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1441895536000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello, all you intermediates, let's get talking!

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

These are very similar to our \u00a0Lets Draw! meetups but the difference of this style of meetup is that it'll be alot more focused and immersive on a very specific theme we will work on together as a group.<\/p> <p>In today's challenge we will each choose a symbol and territory from guilds set in a fantasy world. Once we have chosen our guild we will challenge ourselves to design and draw a character,monster, structure, or etc that would be found in this guild's territory. There will be 10 unique guilds to choose from each with a set of art and concept references to help you envision the environment,citizens, and aesthetics of each guild. The guilds and references used today will be from one of the most popular and well known card games Magic The Gathering!<\/p> <p>The meetup will be split into three parts: First sketches and warm-up exercises, then an hour and a half \u00a0drawing your chosen idea and design, lastly we'll discuss each others drawings and ideas as a group.<\/p> <p>So don't forget to bring your supplies and sketchbook as this meetup is going to be drawing focused! Also if you'd like to share any art or reference books with the group relating to the theme I urge you to bring them.<\/p> <p>You can find me at the tables on the second floor of the Cranberry Cafe.<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there and having fun participating in this new style of meetup and exercising or developing your drawing and conceptual skills with other imaginative artists throughout NYC.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Imaginative-Illustrators-Of-NYC\/events\/225337838\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":12600000,"name":"Conceptual Challenge!

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations.

The space created is sacred and safe for all of us to share our experiences - our thoughts and feelings, our presence, and the rhythms of our breathing as we participate in the expansion of our touch perception.<\/p> <p>This event is expanding now to include everyone interested in evolving their 'touch intelligence'. It has been a monthly women's gathering and a wonderful opportunity to share and celebrate our intention, strength, and life experience!<\/p> <p>You're invited to join this ongoing class at any time. It is 'by donation', because your healing presence is the most important material you can contribute! So please come and donate your body to the science of healing - we will return it renewed and energized.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Every gathering starts with an introduction of ourselves in a circle. You will be introduced to this simple healing touch method. We will practice on each other on the floor lined with yoga mats and blankets. You may want to wear comfortable clothes and bring a yoga mat. This program is designed for every body shape and sensory ability - or sensitivity!\u00a0<\/p> <p>HETEP facilitator, Karuna Ma has been introduced to healing touch very early in life. Since 1998, qualified as a Reiki Master Healer and Seichim Master Teacher.

Since her training in 2001, Karuna has been working as a massage therapist, energy and sound healer.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Starseed-Institute-of-Shamanic-Studies\/events\/225162372\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"HETEP Healing Touch Program","id":"jgbnjlytmbzb","time":1442700000000,"updated":1442709681000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1314900121000,"name":"Montclair Shamanic Circle","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":2424042,"urlname":"Starseed-Institute-of-Shamanic-Studies","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Shamanic Practioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Elmhurst","address_1":"86-40 56 Avenue","name":"Parivara Dhamma Acala Buddhist Temple","lon":-73.875801,"id":24075268,"state":"NY","lat":40.733528,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.09777879715,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442602921000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meditation session: 6-7 PM<\/p> <p>Q &amp; A session: 7-8 PM<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWear comfortable loose clothes.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/singles-1369\/events\/225040687\/","yes_rsvp_count":28,"name":"Speeddating Ages 25-37--SOLD OUT FOR MEN","id":"225040687","time":1442705400000,"updated":1442718611000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1190820219000,"name":"Events for 20's, 30's & 40's Single Manhattan Professionals","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":709584,"urlname":"singles-1369","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Savvy Socializers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11234","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"East 69th and Avenue U","name":"St. Bernard Gym","lon":-73.908966,"id":16671792,"state":"NY","lat":40.618847,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.0275335312,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441927143000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0A Catholic Adult Favorite has become the Casino Pot Luck.

Once she convinces Megan to give her a ride to the creepy old Ulman house, Samantha learns that the job is not quite what was advertised. Ulman and his wife (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/mary-woronov-p117342\">Mary Woronov<\/a>) don't even have a child. He tells Samantha that she just has to stay in the house with his elderly mother-in-law while he and the missus go out to celebrate the lunar eclipse.

Since its inception in 2008, this night race has been run under the lights around the 5.065 km Marina Bay Street Circuit with its 23 corners, the most of any circuit this year. Three drivers (all world champions) have won this race: Lewis Hamilton twice (2009, 2014), Fernando Alonso twice (2008, 2010) and Sebastian Vettel thrice [masked]).\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>STANDINGS -<\/b>\u00a0After a dominant win at Monza, Lewis Hamilton now leads by 53 points over teammate Nico Rosberg (DNF) in the Drivers' Championship. Hamilton has 252 points, Rosberg is second with 199 points and Sebastian Vettel is third with 178 points. In the Constructor's standings, Mercedes sits atop with 451 points, Ferrari sits in 2nd with 270 points and Williams claims 3rd with 188 points.<\/p> <p><b>TYRE ALLOCATION<\/b>\u00a0- Pirelli will be bringing the two softest compounds, yellow (soft) and red (super soft) due to the low grip surface at night.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>DRS ZONES<\/b>\u00a0- There are two DRS zones: pit straight and between turns 5 and 7.\u00a0<\/p> <p>So can Lewis Hamilton continue his dominance with his 8th win of the season?

It is time to hike and run on some real mountains!<\/p> <p><br\/>I can pick you up in NYC and we'll carpool all together in our RawMobile. As you can see, the number of spots is very limited, so first come first serve. The details about pick up and drop off are below. To reserve a spot just RSVP to this meetup.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/c\/d\/600_440793485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our recent day trips to the Catskills were awesome, so we're doing it again. Some folks were running, some were hiking, but all had fun and made new friends. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/past\/?scroll=true\">our photos and comments from the past trips.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There are lots of ways to enjoy a day at North-South Lake Campground, but the main point of interest to us is probably the <b>famous Escarpment Trail<\/b>. If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not doing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/7\/4\/600_441415156.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- lake swimming (in the designated area),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/224642903\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytmbbc","time":1442754000000,"updated":1442766903000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"6 W 33rd St","name":"The Football Factory","lon":-73.985687,"id":18066202,"lat":40.748035,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.263908445835,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442589027000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Will Juventus finally snag a win in the[masked] Serie A campaign? \u00a0Join us bright and early on Sunday morning at The Football Factory to find out. \u00a0A rare morning game - take advantage and get your brunch and coffee on while catching Genoa vs Juve at 9:00AM. \u00a0The team need this win to recover the unexpected losses and draw from the first three matches. \u00a0But how about that spectacular Champions League win over Man City?!!<\/p> <p>Thanks to all new members who have been joining us. \u00a0I've been based overseas for the past year plus and have been organizing these meetups from Italy\/Canada and other locales. \u00a0I am still looking for someone to volunteer to assist with organizing\/hosting. \u00a0If you're interested please send me a message on here or on our Facebook page: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JuventiNYC\">www.facebook.com\/JuventiNYC<\/a>\u00a0.

He won 29 of them including the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka that led to the desegregation of schools throughout America. In 1967 President Johnson nominated Marshall to be the first African- America Associate of the US Supreme Court, a post he would serve for 24 years until he stepped down in 1991.

With a knife and a 12-gauge shotgun, they robbed and murdered a man and his wife and their son and daughter. The deed filled the scene. It echoed through the lives of all who lived nearby, rushing toward some appalling, mysterious point of psychic infinity. It made haggard men out of the guardians of order. Eventually through a fluke almost as gratuitous as the killing itself, they captured the murderers.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

We will ride nearly all trails making a 25 mile loop. This is one of the most sceenic bicycle rides I know of in this area. It is 25 miles round trip through 2 parks, Mohonk Preserve and Minawaska State Park. Although you do not have to be a mountain biker, this ride is not for beginners. This is in advanced ride mainly because of the high intensity aerobic capacity needed for the 2.5 hrs of climbing. You will need to have a strong arobic base and a good fitness endurance level to do this ride. It will take us 2.5 hrs to get to the top, (Awosting beach) don't forget to bring your gargoyles and swimsuit cuz we will be there for an hour swimming @ Awosting beach where there is a lifeguard. This ride starts from the bottom parking lot at the base of Mohonk Mountain at the Pine Street parking lot entrance to the park. From the time your wheels hit the ground, the first 2.5 hrs will be all climbing with consistent rewarding views as you will be riding along the exposed rockface of the mountain for more than half the climb . We will pass rock climbers climbing as we cut through the Gunks we will then be rewarded with generous views of valleys and neighboring Mountains as we ankle through our pedal stroke almost anaerobicly! If you have not been here, you need to go at least once, it is something everyone needs to see at least once in your life the first time I was there it looked exactly like the places I have been to in parts of Europe . At times, it's like riding in Colorado.... Do not worry, it is not all uphill, once we get to the beach it's 95% downhill back to the car takes about an hour &amp; 10 minutes to get back down to the lower lot. Don't forget to take the things with you needed to fix a flat<\/p> <p>Trails are hard packed, gravel carriage double track roads. A, mountain bike, Hybred, or Cyclecross which is a road bike with beefy tires &amp; special breaks for the mud; these are the types of bicycles that will be needed for this ride. I prefer a Mountain Bike or a hybrid although I have ridden my road bike here with oversized hybrid type mountain tires. This is like a road ride in the woods for those who ride road bikes. The terrain its like riding a hilly rail trail, we will stop for breaks at the Gunks, the waterfall, Lake Minawaska, Castle Point and finally Awosting Beach; (the top) This is a 3.5 hr round trip ride actual riding time, be sure to be in shape for this, bring plenty of food, snacks and water. The return route back will be a long decent, there is over an hour of rolling hills; 95% downhill, rolling back to the car. And remember don't forget to bring the things with you needed to change a flat<\/p> <p>After the ride we will stop at either the gilded otter or buccas for some long awaited well deserved food.<\/p> <p>We will meet in the lot at the end of pine road you will see my tandem bike on the roof rack<\/p> <p>NOTE: You are responsible for bringing appropriate gear, supplies, clothing, first aid, and lights.

It was practiced by emperors like Marcus Aurelius, as well as former slaves like the teacher Epictetus. It taught that the most important thing in life is to develop one\u2019s moral character, and that we should live according to our nature, i.e., as social beings capable of reason. Stoicism is experiencing a surprising comeback these days, positioning itself as the Western answer to Buddhism, with which it shares a number of similarities. In this talk I will explain the basics of Stoicism and argue that it is a philosophy highly suitable to the complexities of life in the 21st century.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Massimo Pigliucci<\/b>\u00a0is a biologist and philosopher at the City University of New York.

I'm new to the area and I'm a certified Yoga Instructor. I'd love to meet new people and enjoy the extraordinary parks we have in the Bayside area by bringing together like-minded folks to create community and connect with each other through the powerful practice of yoga!!! Yoga is great for relieving stress, dealing with anxiety, getting in shape and attuning to self awareness. The word yoga means \"union\" and often refers to uniting the breath and the body through breathing exercises and \"asana\" which are the postures used in the physical practice of yoga. And while connecting to our inner self is super important it's also essential to connect the world and people around us! I hope you'll join me as we celebrate the last weeks of summer with outdoor yoga classes! Each class will last about an hour. Please bring your own yoga mat, water (snacks if you want to stay after and eat) and whatever else you need to feel comfortable sitting and moving. There is a $10.00 suggested donation for participating. Thank you. Blessings &amp; Light.<\/p> <p>**Disclaimer: yoga does involve physical activity.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225136477\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflytmbbc","time":1442764800000,"updated":1442778081000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Elizabeth Street between Prince & Spring Streets","name":"Elizabeth Street Garden","lon":-73.833504,"id":20027542,"state":"NY","lat":40.782001,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.4998216629,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438568597000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A supportive community is vital for women on a macro and micro level.

Manhattan. Sunday, September 20th @ 1:00PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend for what might be the last trip of the season!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site.

They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes! Please fill out the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible.\u00a0 If you are uncomfortable posting any of the information on your profile, please email your responses to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.\u00a0 Without a complete application, you will not be considered to receive an invitation.\u00a0 The trips last several hours, so we will have 20-30 people in a confined space for an extended period of time.

In this presentation, Geoff Brady focuses on solar radiation management or SRM or stratospheric aerosol operations. These are the operations that deploy aircraft to release material into the atmosphere, including reflective particulates that are known to reflect the sunlight back into space. We will look at the human health effects of these operations including the blocking of the light frequency needed for creating Vitamin D in the human body. Remember, these operations are officially not happening in real time and are presented to the public as a last resort. Normal water vapor trails that are seen behind a jet dissipate within a couple minutes. Something (nanotechnology?) in the persistent trails are nucleating with particles in the upper atmosphere to create the persistent jet trails that are often dramatically displayed in the sky as grid patterns, huge X's, a smudged mess or parallel lines. Researchers have noted how \"rare\" sundogs, a rainbow effect around the Sun, has a refraction index of Barium, not water. As many may know, high levels of aluminum, barium and strontium, all very toxic to human health and the ecosystems, have tested positive in rain water. Geoff Brady will also present video and photographic evidence of the aerosol operations above New York City. He will share video examining the anomalies associated with these aircraft spraying the persistent trails. Anomalies include aircraft morphing and UFOs near aircraft.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Geoff Brady is a radio producer and host of In Other News, a radio show broadcast on WBAI 99.5 FM and on Pacifica affiliate stations as well as Dark Matter Radio.

Thalbourne has conducted much scientific research into the correlation between transliminality and many other personality traits. He found significant relationships with creative personality, paranormal belief, magical ideation, some types of mental illness, and fantasy proneness, among others. The alleged conclusion is that persons who score higher on measures of transliminality have a lower threshold such that material normally contained within the subconscious is able to pass more easily into the conscious mind thus resulting in a greater readiness to accept phenomena commonly believed to be paranormal.<\/p> <p>Is it possible that transliminality also drives our desire to know cosmic consciousness? Already open to paranormal belief, people who are biologically predisposed to being more \u2018transliminal\u2019 seek out confirmation of their beliefs in the outside world.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Music is organized sound that has potent emotional effects and stimulates memories, associations, and highly developed\u00a0 psychological states with clear impact on our healing systems.\"<\/p> <p>\u00a0Toning* in your own voice is a very powerful tool for self-healing, relaxation, personal growth, opening creativity, and helping to balance life experiences.Toning is the elongation of a note or tone using breath and voice to assist you to get still enough to meditate.<br\/>It is great.....<br\/>\u2022 If you have a difficult time getting still enough to meditate;<br\/>\u2022 If you desire higher states of consciousness;<br\/>\u2022 If your communication energy center seems blocked;<br\/>\u2022 If you breathe too shallowly;<br\/>\u2022 If you need immediate grief or stress relief;<br\/>\u2022 If you're depressed;<br\/>\u2022 If you need more confidence or zest;<br\/>\u2022 If you have trouble listening, focusing or being in the moment<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at the next scheduled meet-up!Please e-mail me at [masked] if you have any questions or concerns.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-and-Silence-Meditation\/events\/225050304\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Sound and Silence Meditation","id":"dnccvhytmbbc","time":1442790000000,"updated":1442802911000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1298719062000,"name":"Sound and Silence Meditation","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1789899,"urlname":"Sound-and-Silence-Meditation","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":6,"distance":9.74920272827,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441918827000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's get together again for the joy of music. \u00a0Bring your instrument (guitar, banjo, keyboard, flute, whatever you've got) or just your voice. \u00a0If you have a good campfire type song, bring the chords and words to share. \u00a0If you have any questions my cell is (908) 313-8327.

It enables real-time voice, video and data sharing in a Web browser without the need for browser plugins or downloads. When WebRTC-enabled applications are coupled with contact centers, customer engagement can be transformed because customers and prospects can communicate with a contact center agent via voice or video from within the context of browsing a web page or from within a dedicated mobile app. This user context can accompany the call to the contact center agent, thus giving agents more information about a user intent, which allows the agent to satisfy the user\u2019s needs faster and better.<\/p> <p>Join business communication and technology expert analyst Brent Kelly of KelCor, Inc. and Plantronics Vice President of Innovation and New Ventures, Cary Bran as they discuss how organizations can rapidly develop and deploy WebRTC-enabled applications using WebRTC APIs.<\/p> <p>Brent Kelly<\/p> <p>Brent Kelly is Principal Analyst at KelCor, Inc. where he focuses on business communications processes and technologies.
