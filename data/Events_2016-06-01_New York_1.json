You want to be formally certified as a Java developer who fully understands the new features in the language and how to use them effectively. Oracle offers a steeply discounted rate on certification exams like the OCA and OCP if you take them during the beta period. The catch is there aren\u2019t study guides available and you often don\u2019t have enough time to study. In this session, attendees will learn how to approach studying for a certification exam without a study guide. In this session, we will use some of the planned Java 9 features as examples to develop this technique. We have very limited seating for this workgroup, so please only register if you really are attending.

CSA is a business model that has existed for decades, in which community members pay up front to fund a farm's startup costs in exchange for weekly deliveries of fresh food. Initially the goal was to encourage greater community participation in local food economies, but lately it has become essentially a convenient marketing strategy. FarmShare aims to reboot this model, by allowing members to earn digital 'shares' by contributing their time, labor, resources and funds to the local agricultural community, which they can then redeem for fresh, delicious food from a network of local farmers and food entrepreneurs.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/food-tech\/events\/230412743\/","yes_rsvp_count":92,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Business of Peer-to-Peer Food","id":"230412743","time":1462401000000,"updated":1463405595000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1268583420000,"name":"Food+Tech Meetup","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1614253,"urlname":"food-tech","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"food innovators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1412 Broadway, Grind, 22nd Floor","name":"Grind, 22nd Floor.","lon":-74.005943,"id":24178403,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458580030000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>**PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS HERE:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/how-to-become-an-indispensable-pm-in-your-first-year-tickets-23821727428\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/how-to-become-an-indispensable-pm-in-your-first-year-tickets-23821727428\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/how-to-become-an-indispensable-pm-in-your-first-year-tickets-23821727428<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Product Managers are a unique breed of people that can relate to both highly technical minds and business oriented operators.

Your team working hard is critical to moving forward, but it rarely keeps an organization innovating at the pace required in today's world. In this panel, we'll hear from a group of leaders from wildly different organizations who are helping their teams to walk that line between productivity and creativity. We'll dig into:<br\/>- Defining the balance of big thinking and tactical execution for your organization<br\/>- The cultural cues, org structures, and routines that encourage both modes of working<br\/>- How to decide which projects require big thinking vs. simply need executed<br\/>- Hiring effectively for both needs<br\/>- How to measure both sides of the equation and incentivize teams accordingly<br\/>- This panel is perfect for those creative leaders responsible for driving these shifts in their organizations, or the change making intrapreneurs making it happen from the ground up.

If your parents were not loved unconditionally, they each developed an inner child which felt unloved. This made it hard for your parents to love you the way you wanted and needed to be loved. When you were not loved unconditionally, you too developed an inner child which felt unloved.<\/p> <p>Your needy inner child, which feels unloved, is locked into the past. It feels that the past has been difficult and painful and is afraid that the future will be the same way. It is afraid and doesn\u2019t feel worthy.<\/p> <p>The thoughts and beliefs of your needy inner child are based on fear, hurt and remorse. There are thoughts of self-recrimination and replaying of old programs of parental disapproval, which now manifest as self-judgment. The underlying message of your needy inner child is, \u201cLife is a struggle.\" Your needy inner child believes it is a victim of the world and carries an underlying feeling of hopelessness and helplessness.<\/p> <p>The way out of this needy inner child rut is first to gain a sense of detachment, which allows you to observe your needy inner child\u2019s thought system in action. Whenever there is a feeling of fear or tension in your body, you can know that there is an underlying attachment or identification with a needy inner child belief system.<\/p> <p>The first step towards healing your needy inner child is through non-judgmental observing. Observing with non-judgment and love allows you the freedom, detachment and the perspective which fosters deep healing. As you learn to be compassionate and understanding of your inner child, the journey to healing begins. If this is done consistently, the needy inner child begins to feel safe and eventually sees a new direction. As you continue this path of observing your needy inner child with love, a sense of hope that the past need not be repeated begins to emerge and a transformation occurs. You will feel more relaxed and will have a sense of trust that you are safe and loved.<\/p> <p>In this 8-week Healing Inner Child Program that is guided by a trained facilitator, you will learn how to give your needy inner child the nurturing attention it has always wanted. As you participate in the Healing Inner Child Program, you will learn to pay attention to what your needy inner child says, thinks, feels and how it behaves. You will learn to observe it with detachment and compassion, realizing you can transform and heal it with the help of your Higher Self.<\/p> <p>In the supportive environment of a group or one on one, you will learn that you are not alone and have a choice to perceive your situation differently. The shared experiences and activities provide a rich opportunity to release limiting fears and bring more unconditional love into your life.<\/p> <p>Included is a workbook with eight lessons that can be a journal of your inner child healing. Weekly focus cards and a guided audio meditation (a male &amp; female voice version) will help you bring your inner child issues to your Higher Self for transformation. What you learn can apply to any relationship \u2014 your spouse, significant other, co-worker, friend or relative.<\/p> <p>The topics of the 8 weekly sessions are:<\/p> <p>Nurturing Your Inner Child\u00a0\u2014 Becoming Your Needy Inner Child's Nurturing ParentThe Inner Critical Parent\u00a0\u2014 Replacing Self-Criticism with Self-NurturingInner Child Baggage\u00a0\u2014 Recognizing &amp; Healing Self-Destructive ThoughtsConnecting with Higher Self\u00a0\u2014 Learning to Connect Your Inner Child with Inner WisdomTransforming Fear\u00a0\u2014 Rocognizing Needy Inner Child Cries for LoveStop, Look &amp; Listen\u00a0\u2014 Paying Attention to Who Is in ChargeHealing Relationships\u00a0\u2014 Seeing Through the Needy Inner Child to Light EssenceSimple, Uncomplicated Love\u00a0\u2014 Expanding Your Identity to Being Love<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIMindailylife\/events\/230482493\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"FREE Intro to Healing Inner Child Workshop","id":"chfqslyvhbgb","time":1462402800000,"updated":1462415096000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455160052000,"name":"Living A Course in Miracles","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":19552857,"urlname":"ACIMindailylife","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460642617000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Together we will hack the night away!

The best part is the more you meditate, the more easily you can access this place to help you get through times of stress and uncertainty.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe other day I saw a framed picture and on it had the words, \"You are a masterpiece.\" It had me thinking.<\/p> <p>This is true for all of us. We are all masterpieces. We were created from the Divine (or whatever you call your higher power) and came to this earth in perfect form. But what happened? Things happened to us that made us think different. We were made fun of, abused, events happened that scared us and made us think we were less than what we really are. All of these life events can make us \u00a0worry, stress, and feel sad. These thoughts and feelings dim our light and cover up who we really are. They cover up all of our potential and dim the magnificent light is within all of us.<\/p> <p>Who would we be if we didn\u2019t complain? What could we create? What if we didn\u2019t have judgement and just lived authentically?<\/p> <p>Who would we be if we didn't let life's stresses and insecurities bring us down? What would we accomplish? What would we change and let go of?<\/p> <p>How do we get to that place? How do we uncover all of the layers to get to who we really are and tap into our beautiful essence?

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

Van Cortlandt \u00a0was established as a park in 1888 and has the oldest house in the Bronx as well as the borough\u2019s largest freshwater lake.\u00a0\u00a0Its upper basin can be appreciated from the Van Cortlandt Golf Course \u00a0which itself made history as the nation's first municipal golf course when it opened in 1895. \u00a0Van Cortlandt Park is also home to\u00a0the Van Cortlandt House Museum, Van Cortlandt Nature Center, and\u00a0a number of amenities such as various sports fields, running trails, a multi-use stadium, a pool, and the Riverdale Stables.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, New York was buried beneath massive glaciers. When the ice receded, it left behind the characteristic sketch of Van Cortlandt Park\u2014steep ridges, gradual hills, and open flats\u2014and exposed its three major rock components: Fordham Gneiss, Inwood Dolomite, and Manhattan Schist. It took about seven thousand years for Paleo\u2013Indians to arrive in this area, following mastodon, giant beaver, and caribou across North America.<\/p> <p><br\/>By 1000 AD, Woodland Indians known as the Lenape began permanent settlements from lower New York State through Delaware. The Wiechquaskeck Lenapes occupied this site, settling into an agricultural lifestyle. They hunted in wooded uplands, fished in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/the-park\/features\/15-natural-areas\/46-tibbetts-brook.html\">Tibbetts Brook<\/a>, farmed on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/the-park\/features\/34-fields\/58-parade-ground.html\">Parade Ground<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/the-park\/features\/34-fields\/62-indian-field.html\">Indian Field<\/a>\u00a0and foraged through meadows and forests for nuts, fruits and other edible plants.<\/p> <p>In 1639, the Dutch East India Company brought the first Europeans to settle in the Bronx, purchasing most of today\u2019s Bronx County from the local Natives and, in 1646, sold it to Holland native Adriaen Van Der Donck, who became the first single owner of what is now Van Cortlandt Park. His vast estate \u201cde Jonkeerslandt\u201c gave Yonkers its name. The land passed through several families, each gradually developing it into viable farmland and a working plantation.<\/p> <p>The Van Cortlandt name was first associated with the tract of land bounded by modern Yonkers City Line between Broadway, Jerome Avenue, and Van Cortlandt Park East in 1694, when Jacobus Van Cortlandt bought the property. During the 1690s, he dammed Tibbetts Brook to create the 16\u2013acre lake to power a gristmill. The Van Cortlandt Mansion was built in 1748 by his son, Frederick Van Cortlandt, whose family occupied the land until the 1880s. Frederick also established the family burial plot on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/the-park\/features\/16-monuments\/57-vault-hill.html\">Vault Hill<\/a>\u00a0where, at the onset of the American Revolution, City Clerk Augustus Van Cortlandt hid the city records from the British Army.<\/p> <p>For more info see:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.vcpark.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>We\u2019ll meet at the\u00a0front of the #1 Train\u2019s northbound platform at the 96th Street station (Broadway and West 96th Street) at 12 Noon<\/b>\u00a0and ride until the 242 St. Van Cortlandt Park Station. \u00a0Alternatively,\u00a0the Bx9 travels along Broadway on the western edge of Van Cortlandt Park.\u00a0<\/p> <p>RSVP at right. \u00a0There is no charge for this event!<\/p> <p>At the field trip's end, we'll gather for a bite to eat or a beverage (Optional and dutch).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Group of Photographers at Front of #1 Train\u2019s northbound platform at the 96th Street Station (Broadway and West 96th Street) at 12 Noon","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYPhotoSafari\/events\/230692394\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"FIELD TRIP\u2014VAN CORTLANDT PARK , BRONX, NY, THURSDAY MAY 5, 2016, 12 NOON!","id":"230692394","time":1462464000000,"updated":1462764347000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1034097731000,"name":"NY Photo & Safari Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":120182,"urlname":"NYPhotoSafari","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Atlantic Highlands","address_1":"135 First Avenue","name":"Atlantic Highlands Arts Council","lon":-74.039017,"id":24375845,"state":"NJ","lat":40.411953,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5461673737,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455828895000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/parla-italiano\/events\/229336469\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"practice our Italian","id":"qfjqqlyvhbhb","time":1462465800000,"updated":1462474046000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455827255000,"name":"Italian Language Meetup","group_lon":-74.0400009155,"id":19590505,"urlname":"parla-italiano","group_lat":40.4000015259,"who":"Italian language speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462227434000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a brief introduction to static tech and a preview of my Saturday Jekyll Conference talk for members of the Civic Hall community.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside and Booker T Washington as backups.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 12pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

We are accepting one more player on a first-come, first served basis. This is subject to change quickly and I apologize if I can\u2019t accommodate you in this game when you do reach out to me.<\/p> <p><br\/>INTRODUCTION:Until just days ago, most members of our party were blissfully unaware of the Keys of Power and their creator, the Aramago. Even those that had any inkling of these topics thought the stories they\u2019d heard to be mere legends. Then one of the Keys of Power was almost literally dropped in their lap. They were suddenly running for their lives guarding Melrick, the courier ferrying that item to a safe place.<\/p> <p><br\/>Now, Melrick is dead and the party is cast adrift in an alien realm of existence. What\u2019s worse, they\u2019ve been separated from more than half of their number with seemingly no hope to reunite with them. So Theron, Clovis, and Drom cast about for ways to return to their home plane, reunite with their comrades, and most importantly, convey the precious cargo they carry to its rightful place.<\/p> <p><br\/>However, all is not lost. Potential new allies have stepped forward. Already the elven ranger Thamior has shown his worth by warning the party of an impending ambush and nearly dying in helping to fight it off. And he\u2019s introduced them to two more he knows can be trusted once the four of them reach the tiny village they hope will be a safe haven. They have just begun to relax for a\u00a0much-needed\u00a0warm meal when a gypsy strolls into the tavern and engages them directly with a desperate plea for help.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. It is a shell that encompasses the numerous, separate adventures the players will enjoy during an\u00a0epic\u00a0quest to recover all the Keys of Power.<\/p> <p><br\/>This game is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month. We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Thursday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game. I know this because each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/229780291\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Keeper of the Keys - An Azocar Adventure","id":"ndvsrlyvgblc","time":1462487400000,"updated":1462631233000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"412 8th Ave & 31st St, 4th Floor","lon":-73.994835,"phone":"212-244-0011","name":"You Should Be Dancing Studio\/Club 412","id":448325,"state":"NY","lat":40.750278,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.254355370998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451565019000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>6:30pm beginner Level with Sophie<\/p> <p>7:30pm Pre-Intermediate Level with Jason Myra<\/p> <p>8:30pm Intermediate Level with Jason Myra<\/p> <p>9:30pm to 10:30pm Practice Session ( free for \"you should be dancing studio\" students, $5 for others)<\/p> <p><br\/>Price: $25 for drop in or $100 for the month ( 1 class per week for 4 weeks)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"4th floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/salsanewyork\/events\/230745958\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":14400000,"name":"Salsa on2 classes:Beginner, Pre-Inter, Inter +Free Practice Session","id":"hlmgnlyvhbhb","time":1462487400000,"updated":1462502696000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1219086006000,"name":"Salsa New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1261788,"urlname":"salsanewyork","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Salsa New Yorker"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427334400000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I provide with copies each time, but feel free to bring a topic of your interest, Italian books and magazines if you like.<\/p> <p>It's a very open meeting in which we will try to speak Italian from day 1: full immersion with language ;)<\/p> <p>Challenge yourself<\/p> <p>Ti aspetto<\/p> <p>Valentina<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AUTHENTIC-ITALY-language-culture-undiscoveredPlacesinland\/events\/229331791\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Beginners: refresh the adjectives - 1 hour and half for $25","id":"smwhglyvhbhb","time":1462487400000,"updated":1462500718000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389553401000,"name":"AUTHENTIC ITALY with a MA Native + Cultural tours","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12051672,"urlname":"AUTHENTIC-ITALY-language-culture-undiscoveredPlacesinland","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Authentic Italy Eagers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461943075000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We handle our RSVPs through email instead of MeetUp so send us an email at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b>.<\/p> <p>WAG is a workshop of writers and actors who get together for the sake of developing scripts, working on cold reading skills, networking, and honing our crafts.

Why his name is Ignacio Zaragoza and he is one of the main reasons we celebrate Cinco De Mayo. ... Actually we Americans typically celebrate to have yet another festive reason to inebriate and appreciate Mexican food and culture. In Mexico this dude is the hero that repelled the Frenchies from occupying Mexico like the 1%ers they were back then. Culinarily though I am curious to know how that cuisine would have evolved over the years. Mexican food with French influence. Hmmmmm.. My mind stirs.<\/p> <p><br\/>So armed with this knowledge we will enter the halls of <a href=\"http:\/\/rosamexicano.com\/\">Rosa Mexicano<\/a> ready to party up like it's 1862. The food at this place is simply fabulous and if you have never been the guac is exceptionally well crafted. Made fresh always table side it is a marvel to behold and taste. Rosa is also known for their fantastic margaritas one such is their pomegranate margarita which is a signature to their restaurant.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>I do have to warn you all<\/b>; Cinco De Mayo in NYC is a hard jam packed party every year. Most Mexican spots that celebrate will be packed to the gills. Service in most spots will not be stellar and it will be mostly standing room.<\/p> <p><br\/>Know that I am planning this event as a <b>standing room only<\/b> event for the most part. After 7:30 I will have a small table limited to the <b>first 4 people who arrive and desire to be seated.<\/b> Otherwise I will be partying up with the rest of you at the bar for the majority of the night. If you are down for this momentous party RSVP now! The food, drinks and atmosphere will be fabulous and it will a great night to remember.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nAnd now...

We all learned a lot. As you know, the Salon concept has really caught on and it is growing more rapidly than we could've anticipated or hoped. With that in mind, we are already planning our calendar for the second quarter. Topics include:<\/p> <p><br\/>* Sustainability in finance: how to build and grow a \"new model for banking<\/p> <p>* Blockchain: Myth and Reality of this important new technology<\/p> <p><br\/>* What do you want to propose?<\/p> <p>The real reason for this note is item #3 above.

There is no conference call or video feed for the distant session, simply lie or sit down in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed from 7:45pm - 8:45pm. PLEASE READ THE REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY (see below). Here's Carol's write up for the session -<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session Carol and Geordie will be using Merlin's Grace level Vortex Healing\u00ae Divine Energy Healing, Geordie's Angelic Liquid Light Healing and a Divine consciousness tool that comes through for Carol. We will be channeling, with the assistance of the archangels,\u00a0to clear any block or impediments to our harmonious relationship with the Divine Mother. We will also be invoking blessings from the Divine Mother.<\/p> <p><br\/>It looks like the Divine Mother is gradually unveiling the glories of Spring for us. I hope you have been soaking in the wonders of the sunny days that have been coming our way. Our last session was in honor of Earth Day and our Mother Earth Gaia. \u00a0It was a really deep and nurturing session. Thanks to all who participated! We continue to ride the cloak tails of that energy in our next session. The Divine mother shows Herself to us in the wonderful outpouring of the multiplicity of creation. Even though She is the creatrix of life's many forms, she also expresses her love for us as a mother would show love for her own children. The Divine Mother reveals a very personal direct and intimate aspect of the Divine, thus we can enter into a relationship with Her in a communion that is part best friend, part loving mother, part confident and part patient teacher. We see the face of the Divine Mother showing up in various ways in different cultures throughout our history. to name just a few of these She has appeared as;<\/p> <p><br\/>Durga, Lakshmi the Goddess of abundance, Sarasvati the Goddess of knowledge and the arts, and Shakti the Goddess of Divine energy in the Hindu tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/>Mother Mary from the Christian tradition<\/p> <p><br\/>Athena Goddess of wisdom, Demeter mother Goddess, and Aphroditie Goddess of love from the Greek tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/>Isis, Sekmet and Maat from the Egyptian tradition<\/p> <p><br\/>Kuan Yin from the Buddhist tradition.<\/p> <p>Green Tara from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/>White Buffalo Calf Woman from the Native North American Tradition<\/p> <p><br\/>Sedna from the Inuit tradition.<\/p> <p><br\/>And, of course Gaia, Mother Earth.<\/p> <p><br\/>So we can see that The Divine Mother has always been with us making her grace available and looking after us with her gifts of abundant life.<br\/>Here is a Youtube video that explores the way Divine Mother shows up in many traditions:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5WYf-9xtW-c\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5WYf-9xtW-c\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5WYf-9xtW-c<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Vortex Registration Instructions<br\/><\/b><br\/>In order to register, you must email me at [masked] stating that you are coming in person or that you want to be put on the distant list.

Even the times I wasn't able to to fully concentrate and enjoy the experience, I felt such a sense of joy and upliftment wash over me when I was doing tasks and I knew this was real what I was experiencing. I suffer from depression and each session makes me feel like a child at my healthiest and happiest state, or as if I am on a very high dose of anti - depressants without the terrible side effects. It means so much to me and I just want to thank you so much - you truly have a gift!\" SB (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"The session was fabulous, afterward I felt light as a feather.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

The Project Speakers prepare their speeches according to the project assignment.<\/p> <p>b).\u00a0 The second part of the meeting is Table Topics, which are brief impromptu speeches that require no preparation. \u00a0There are\u00a0two purposes during this part. \u00a0The first purpose is to provide a speaking opportunity to members and prospective members who do not have a speaking role.\u00a0The second purpose is to improve our impromptu speaking skills.<\/p> <p>c).\u00a0 The third and final part of the meeting is the Evaluation portion.\u00a0Evaluation is an important part of a Toastmasters meeting. Unless we receive feedback on our speeches to know what our strengths and weaknesses are, we will not improve our communication and listening skills.<\/p> <p>In the club meeting, you practice giving prepared speeches as well as brief impromptu presentations (Table Topics). There is no rush and no pressure: The Toastmasters program allows you to progress at your own pace.<\/p> <p>Constructive evaluation is central to the Toastmasters philosophy. Receiving - and giving - such feedback is a great learning experience. In Toastmasters, encouragement and improvement go hand-in-hand.<\/p> <p>Toastmasters is a place where you develop and grow - both personally and professionally. You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations. You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Brokaw Avenue is also 258th Street.

This led us to census data, data collected at the state and city level, as well as various API's including Google Maps, Yelp, and Streeteasy. One key requirement, was to reference any data we collected to a particular NYC neighborhood. That meant storing data categorized at the neighborhood level. However, more often than not, data available was by geographical coordinates or zip code, leading us to create a mapping to the appropriate neighborhood.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Having all our data reference a particular neighborhood simplified the database and algorithm design processes. We stored our data in a star schema design with our neighborhoods at the center. \u00a0This enabled quick quering as well as the ability to add, remove, and update our data seamlessly. Our algorithm uses this data to identify neighborhoods whose characteristics most closely match what a user inputs inputs in our form, finding the best suited neighborhoods across NY. The algorithm weighs more heavily what is important to users, to ensure suitable responses.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Lastly, we were able to add other features like map and street view, learn more and the ability to graph all results from a query to find trends. Along with Facebook login, these features help create a conprehensive and user friendly site for anyone to use.\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --- Jack, part of the Mapper NYC Team<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Byte-Academy-Finance-and-Technology-community\/events\/230849528\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Demo Day and Graduation - Mapper NYC","id":"230849528","time":1462568400000,"updated":1462580682000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1404838320000,"name":"Byte Academy: FinTech, Data Science, Python Coding Bootcamp","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":15579152,"urlname":"Byte-Academy-Finance-and-Technology-community","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":4.87490606308,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1402421871000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Friday evening Knitting Social for anyone interested in knitting and sipping cocktails after a long week. \u00a0The first Friday is July 4th so this month we hope you can join on the 2nd Friday!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Knit-Up\/events\/229621725\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"First Fridays Knit Up at Brooklyn General Store!","id":"qwqxsjyvhbjb","time":1462568400000,"updated":1462577031000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401049754000,"name":"Brooklyn Knit Up","group_lon":-74,"id":14667512,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Knit-Up","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Brooklyn Knitters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"9011 3rd Ave","name":"Bridgeview Diner","lon":-74.032188,"id":23853643,"lat":40.620682,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":9.22325801849,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458479296000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Make the effort to come, you'll feel better, and you'll meet great people.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be inside with the sign \"Meet up\"","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/I-need-someone-to-talk-to\/events\/229731291\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":14400000,"name":"Push yourself to come to Brooklyn","id":"229731291","time":1462568400000,"updated":1462598772000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1394899023000,"name":"I need someone to talk to.","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":13357542,"urlname":"I-need-someone-to-talk-to","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1048 Fifth Avenue, Main entrance on 86th Street","name":"The Neue Galerie","lon":-73.96022,"id":8412972,"state":"NY","lat":40.78121,"repinned":true},"headcount":15,"distance":9.79030132294,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455981130000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":4.82999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We'll be seeing - - -\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Munch and Expressionism\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/d\/600_447026413.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Above:\u00a0<\/i>The Scream (1895) by Edvard Munch (1863 - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01944).\u00a0Pastel on board in the original\u00a0frame.<\/b><\/p> <p>\"Munch and Expressionism\" is an exhibition that examines Edvard Munch\u2019s influence on his German and Austrian contemporaries, as well as their influence upon him. The show offers a compelling new look at works by the Norwegian artist, whose painting\u00a0<i><b>The Scream<\/b><\/i>\u00a0has become a symbol of modern angst. The Neue Galerie is the sole venue for the exhibition. This exhibition has been organized in partnership with The Munch Museum, Oslo.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Edvard Munch [masked]) was highly regarded for his exploration of dark themes, including alienation, sin, and human vulnerability. Munch\u2019s use of vivid color intensifies the emotional power of his subject matter, an approach which helped to pave the way for an entirely new attitude towards art during the early twentieth century. Although much has been written about the relationship between Munch\u2019s personal life and his art, this exhibition is the first thorough study of the artist\u2019s work in the context of his German and Austrian peers.<\/p> <p>The exhibition consists of approximately 35 paintings and 50 works on paper from both public and private collections worldwide. The German artists included in the exhibition are Max Beckmann, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Gabriele Mu\u0308nter, and Emile Nolde, and the Austrians included are Richard Gerstl, Oskar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele. The exhibition compares all of these artists\u2019 approaches to key themes such as adolescence, urban anxiety, and self-portraiture, and to innovative developments in printmaking during this time. The exhibition will include several works that have never before been seen in the United States.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/7\/d\/600_447035965.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a multi-group meetup.

So little in fact, that there\u2019s never been a feature film based on this true life event that literally changed history by eventually leading to voting rights for women.<\/p> <p>But these women of the suffrage movement who were willing to sacrifice everything they had for their right to vote, finally get a feature film in Sarah Gavron\u2019s soul-stirring Suffragette, a film that doubles as both an unforgettable history lesson and a darn good piece of entertainment. Though it narrows its focus down to the singular perspective of just a few of the movement\u2019s key participants during a thin slice of the 50+ year battle for women\u2019s voting rights, and because the subject matter carries such relevance in today\u2019s world, Suffragette is a film that matters. And one that must be seen.<\/p> <p>Bookended by grainy newsreel footage of actual pre-World War I marches and public parades by the women of the suffragette movement in Britain, Gavron\u2019s film uses the perspective of an ordinary woman to explore what instilled these women with such drive and determination. That woman is the fictional amalgam of working class women of the time named Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), who was initially an outsider to the cause but who eventually crosses paths with key figures in the real-life suffragettes\u2019 history such as Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep), Emily Davison (Natalie Press), and Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter).\" -- Frank Wilkins Reel Reviews<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/9\/9\/600_446643993.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Justice-Books-Films-in-Central-Jersey\/events\/228677461\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Film: Suffragette (2015)","id":"228677461","time":1462575600000,"updated":1462587955000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1453125980000,"name":"Social Justice Books\/Films in Central Jersey","group_lon":-74.4400024414,"id":19359552,"urlname":"Social-Justice-Books-Films-in-Central-Jersey","group_lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Social Justice Advocates"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07041","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Millburn","address_1":"189 Main Street","name":"Casa Colombo Civic Association","lon":-74.307854,"id":8438132,"state":"NJ","lat":40.719128,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.8117008209,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459557767000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Let\u2019s all meet to introduce ourselves.

In addition to a sleeping bag, you need a very good sleeping pad. It is important to have insulation between you and the ground. The filling in your sleeping bag that is underneath you will be compressed and provide no insulation. I highly recommend a sleeping pad with an R value of at least 5. (Hint: most closed cell foam pads have a 2.5 R value. If you double them up you will have a combined R value of 5.)<\/p> <p>You will also need something to keep the weather off of you while you sleep. Since we're below the tree line, any small 3 season tent should do. You want something with good ventilation so that you don't get soaked in condensation over night.<\/p> <p>I also ask that all participants bring a small bundle of wood. You can purchase local wood. There are strict regulations on transporting firewood within the State of New York. If you plan to carry wood from home, it must be kiln dried. If you want to see why this is so important, go check out the birch trees in the Adirondacks.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/2\/600_446012578.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/d\/600_446012589.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hvhikers\/events\/230473305\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Spring Camping in the Taconics","id":"230473305","time":1462575600000,"updated":1462588020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1229395389000,"name":"Hudson Valley Hikers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1338658,"urlname":"hvhikers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"HV Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"420 Park Ave South","name":"Gansevoort Park Avenue NYC","lon":-73.984032,"id":20739622,"lat":40.743847,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.528537094593,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461700546000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get tickets at: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upscale-singles-mixer-at-gansevoort-park-tickets-24963984951\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upscale-singles-mixer-at-gansevoort-park-tickets-24963984951<\/a><\/p> <p>(No tickets will be sold at event door.

Love attracts angels that protect and guide the beloveds. The Third Force, a numinous presence, joins two people and can expand to include family and community. A group soul united in purpose can be a spiritual braid of empowered energy and influence to catalyze planetary transformation. A place to affirm oneness and a connection to the divine, a temple is a declaration to the world of the power of love and unity. Since the earliest architecture, higher vision has been expressed by building sacred space with a community aligned in spirit.<\/p> <p>Artists Alex Grey and Allyson Grey, co-founders of CoSM, Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, will share their journey of painting, performance art and social sculpture that has led to building Entheon, a sanctuary of Visionary Art, now in construction in the Hudson Valley.

It's one of the most visually attractive spaces in the City, and possesses an atmosphere that just puts you in the mood to be entertained. The artists are always amazing- featuring either up and coming acts or those who've made it and want to play a more intimate venue. Even the crowd that attends usually adds something special by interacting with the artist to create an involved listening experience. And best of all, It's free. Yep, I said it- 100% free. You can't beat that with a stick. Or maybe you can. I don't know- I'm not that familiar with sticks. Anyway, If you want to enjoy good music with good company, all in an amazing space, join us at BAMcafe.<\/p> <p>Here's some info about the artist from the BAMcafe website:<\/p> <p><i>This powerhouse R&amp;B quartet blends funk grooves and the bluesy wail of frontman Mark Levy for an irresistibly eccentric sound that draws from the likes of Talking Heads and the Mothers of Invention. Their propulsive live shows tend toward the outrageously theatrical, while lyrically they spin offbeat narratives about everything from witches\u2019 hats to shipwrecks to the mysteries of the Hollywood Hills.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0I recommend you check out their website, <a href=\"http:\/\/theacademybluesproject.com\/video\/\">here<\/a>, and check out a couple videos of their performances.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One last thing to keep in mind, the space isn't tiny, but it has been known to fill up quickly in the past. Getting there on time or even a little early goes a long way toward not standing while you enjoy the show. I'll get there early and try to save as many seats as possible, but some help with that would be appreciated.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/230694676\/","yes_rsvp_count":42,"name":"BAMcafe: The Academy Blues Project","id":"230694676","time":1462579200000,"updated":1462640974000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07006","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"West Caldwell","address_1":"42 Fairfield Place","lon":-74.292207,"phone":"(201) 390-9933","name":"Tiger Tennis","id":533633,"state":"NJ","lat":40.867246,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":0,"distance":17.7958087921,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449210693000,"fee":{"amount":40,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>ALL LEVELS ARE WELCOME<\/b><\/p> <p>(If you are a beginner and wish to join the party, please come for a brief rating session before joining the party.\u00a0 This is a social tennis group, rather than an instructional session.) <b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Also check out my website:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennis-buffs.com\">www.tennis-buffs.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b>If you sign up via Meet Up site, you must call me to find out your start time.\u00a0 I would like to stagger players.\u00a0 You may or may not be able to start at 8pm, as it depends on how many spots there are left.\u00a0 Thank you for your understanding.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Fridays, start 8pm<\/b><br\/>Cost $40, includes tennis, balls and food<br\/>6 Indoor hard courts<\/p> <p>What better way to spend an evening than to be with people with common interests, playing tennis and meeting old and new friends.<\/p> <p><br\/>It's a melting pot of wonderful cultures.

He began studying the guitar at seven years of age. Five years later, Mr. Barbosa Lima made his concert debut in his native city and in Rio de Janeiro. He began recording while still in his teens and continued to appear regularly in concert on Brazilian television. His early studies were with Isaias Savio, who is considered, the father of the modern Brazilian guitar movement, and later with the legendary Andres Segovia.<\/p> <p>Since his United States debut in 1967, he has enjoyed a global concert career in which the public and music critics are united in acclaiming him one of the world\u2019s leading masters of the guitar.<\/p> <p>Mr. Barbosa-Lima is widely recognized for his extraordinary skills as a performer and as an arranger of a wide variety of music from Scarlatti to Debussy, from Gershwin to Jobim and Brubeck and those in between. His inspired performances have catapulted him onto the world stage.<\/p> <p><b>Larry Del Casale <\/b>has been performing as a soloist and chamber musician since 1983 as demonstrated on his CD,\u00a0<i>Zenobia<\/i>. His love for the ensemble format has afforded him the opportunity to work with a variety of distinguished artists over the years.\u00a0<i>The New York Times<\/i>\u00a0and other publications have praised Mr. Del Casale\u2019s artistry and musicianship in the ensemble format.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In 1997, Mr. Del Casale was introduced to Carlos Barbosa-Lima through their mutual friend, Puerto Rican composer Ernesto Cordero. After six years of assisting and learning the arrangements of Barbosa-Lima, Del Casale and Barbosa-Lima debuted as a duo at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall in 2003. Since then, Del Casale has assisted Barbosa-Lima in concert as his duo partner. In 2010, they were guest performers on WNYC\u2019s\u00a0<i>SoundCheck<\/i>\u00a0with host John Schaefer, and a few days later they appeared for a third time at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.<\/p> <p>In 2012, Barbosa-Lima and Del Casale recorded the\u00a0<i>Micropiezas<\/i>\u00a0by Leo Brouwer for a ZOHO record label release.
