In <i>Lean In<\/i> Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, expands on ideas discussed in her various TED talks regarding women in leadership roles in the workplace, the barriers they face, and the institutional and individual changes she contends can help women make the leap into leadership positions. Shortly after its publishing <i>Lean In<\/i> sparked intense debate over Sandberg's views on women and leadership, and is sure to spark such debate in our discussion as well!<\/p> <p>Our discussion will be held at Seasons 52 at the Mall in Columbia starting at 6pm. There are sometimes a couple book club groups that meet at the same time, so make sure to mention Lauren's name to the hostess. Come hungry (and thirsty, it is a Speakeasy after all!) and ready to discuss--but if you haven't read the book yet no worries! Please still feel free to come and meet our group members.

This event is open to Reiki Practitioners as well as those simply curious about Reiki. Reiki practitioners of all levels of training, as well as all lineages, often enjoy the opportunity to participate in communal Reiki sessions known as Reiki Shares or Reiki Circles. The sessions give each person a chance to learn from one another as practitioners, as well as benefiting from multiple healing hands during the sessions. At this event we will take turns performing and receiving Reiki. Those that are not Reiki practitioners will be pared up with experienced Reiki practitioners.

The most noticeable changes were that it really pushed me passed my plateau in my growth by helping me clear out some energetic blocks and feelings that I thought I had taken care of. If your true goal is to elevate your vibration, this will do it. The 2nd time and probably the most amazing was getting the spheres to relieve pain. I was having joint pain and migraines. I was about to go on a 2 week vacation with lots of walking, so Jenn gave me the spheres and I didn\u2019t have any hip\/joint pain or migraines the entire time!! It was so good that I told her next time I travel, I\u2019m booking a session with her and asked that she also add spheres to my feet!\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cJenn is too awesome to put into words. Humble, sweet, and loving\u2026she uses these in Holistic Metamorphosis to be a catalyst for the change you seek.

Strata brings \"deft ensemble playing\" and a \"talent that's worth getting worked up about\" (Washington Post) to a repertoire that combines the great trio and duo repertoire of the past with an ever-growing body of new works written especially for them over the more than 25 years they have been playing together. All holders of the Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the Juilliard School, the members of Strata are dedicated to every level of music education, from the mentoring of graduate students and young professionals, to the initial sparking of musical passion in very young children, to the guiding of audiences in what to listen for. Spoken commentary is an integral part of all their concerts.<\/p> <p>Due to January's snow this February program opens the third concert year of 4th Friday monthly concerts. Concert pianist Brian Ganz was the inspiration of the series, is Artistic Director and periodic performer. All concerts are offered at 8PM at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Annapolis (UUCA).

Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit.<\/p> <p>I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming, to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls. (maybe even some voice) You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. All you need do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted.

Based on Ambassador Avner\u2019s best-selling book, <i>The Prime Ministers<\/i>, the film examines Rabin\u2019s election as the country\u2019s first native born Israeli leader in 1974, his negotiating the first bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1975, the dramatic events surrounding Israel\u2019s rescue of hostages in Entebbe in 1976, the tense relationship between newly elected US President Jimmy Carter and Rabin and Rabin\u2019s subsequent downfall in a financial scandal involving his wife Leah. The movie also explores Ambassador Avner\u2019s decision to work for Menachem Begin when he surprised the world in 1977 by being elected the Prime Minister of Israel. It looks at the drama behind Anwar Sadat\u2019s historic visit to Jerusalem, the Camp David negotiating process, the difficult relationship between President Carter and Menachem Begin as well as the tense relations that arose between Begin and President Reagan over the 1982 Lebanon War. The documentary also recounts Begin\u2019s decline after the death of his beloved wife Aliza, and Yehuda Avner\u2019s career as a diplomat in the UK and Australia before returning to Israel to work with Yitzhak Rabin not long before his assassination in 1995, after he had been elected a second time as Israel\u2019s Prime Minister.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Baltimore-Jewish-Book-Club\/events\/228811471\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Prime Ministers:Soldiers and Peacemakers","id":"228811471","time":1456617600000,"updated":1456666251000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331755463000,"name":"The Baltimore Jewish Book Club","group_lon":-76.6900024414,"id":3479352,"urlname":"The-Baltimore-Jewish-Book-Club","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Baltimore Bookniks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hanover","address_1":"7000 Arundel Mills Circle","name":"Dave & Buster's","lon":-76.725616,"id":23585384,"state":"MD","lat":39.162334,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.4981880188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456549758000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get together for Food &amp; Fun<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Night-Owls-Auto-Club\/events\/229169980\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":17700000,"name":"Night Owls End Of The Month Hangout","id":"229169980","time":1456617600000,"updated":1456648615000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436431241000,"name":"Night Owls Auto Club","group_lon":-76.8899993896,"id":18729321,"urlname":"Night-Owls-Auto-Club","group_lat":38.8499984741,"who":"Night Owls Auto Club"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Rosedale","address_1":"1331 Seling Ave","name":"Rosedale American Legion Hall","lon":-76.512489,"id":21505362,"state":"MD","lat":39.324883,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":6.24541139603,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452051097000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>You haven't LIVED until you've been to a\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0Blues Society show !

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

There are approximately 52,000 birds remaining, but threats to their habitats and survival are very real. Human interference used to pose the greatest threat. Collection of their eggs for human consumption and collection of guano used for fertilizer destroyed nesting sites which contributed to the penguins near extinction. The penguins at The Maryland Zoo are true ambassadors for this threatened species.

Sunny and 50s. This hike has a 2 mile out and back section at the beginning with a loop around the river at the end. Total distance is 8-9 miles. There are no major hills but there will be about a dozen hills of 100 feet or less to climb. Lots of views of the river since we'll be following the Little Gunpowder the entire hike. We'll hike at about a 2.5 to 3 mph pace with very few breaks. I would call this a moderate hike because of the hills, mud and distance. Please bring plenty of water. 1 Liter is recommended. The trail is dirt, rocks, roots, and some mud. Plan for appropriate footwear. Scratch, that, there will be LOTS of mud. Don't wear your Sunday best. Waterproof footwear is recommended. We will step off at 10:30AM.<\/p> <p>Dogs are welcome on this hike but they must be well behaved and on lead at all times. Long hiking pants are highly recommended!

This session will focus on dashboards. Dashboards provide a visual display of your program\u2019s or organization\u2019s status. They are valuable because they quickly provide information about areas of strength and challenge, and all necessary information is available in one convenient location. During the session, Taj and Dana will talk about the basics of developing a dashboard and how to select the best medium for the visual presentation of your data (i.e., should it be a static document, or an interactive and dynamic dashboard?) They will also provide examples of dashboards and talk about aspects of DataViz design that work for programs of all varieties.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bios of Presenters<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carsonresearch.com\/who\/crc-data-nerds\/taj\/\"><b>Taj Carson, PhD<\/b><\/a>\u00a0is the CEO and founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carsonresearch.com\/\">Carson Research Consulting (CRC)<\/a>, where she oversees all aspects of CRC.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long).

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category.

If you have any suggestions or needs, please let me know. I have participated in about 10 different meeting groups around the country to learn, and have borrowed some of their formats. I am not a scholar, nor an expert- I do not have the material memorized. I merely study with the group, and the effects on my life have been profound. I do not require participants to prepare for the meetings. Some people do the daily lessons at home, which are highly recommended. Some people read the chapter ahead of time to get an overview. It is nice to have your own book, but this is not mandatory for learning.

All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more. These meetings are open to all who wish to attend; there is a small fee for each meeting.<\/p> <p>For more information see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bess-md.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bess-md.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BESS-MD\/events\/228060688\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Educational Meeting!

Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

You may also recognize a couple of them from their induction photo earlier in the evening. Lindsey entertained us with her adventures in getting lost in Europe; Kelsy reminded us to be careful not to love something so much that we kill it (e.g. favorite lakes and streams); Barbara explained her GIFTS that keep on giving; and Emily talked about three key factors in a successful interview (slouching - see photo - is NOT one of them.) And a special shout-out to our guests - and a couple soon-to-be-members: Jane, Lois, Walter, Linda, Ali, Lisa and Jessica!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/collage_02_11_16.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our January 14\u00a0meeting was so special with a reporter and photographers from the Baltimore Sun, and 18 guests! Some came back for our meeting on January 28, and the others must have had conflicts. At least that's our story - and we're sticking with it. Joseph gets the \"centerfold\" in this week's collage, as he gave his icebreaker speech, telling us about his unfailing loyalty to the Terps. He proudly displays his minted gift box. Ben (a new member) jumped right in with the humorist role, imploring us to focus on the big picture and what message a speaker is telling, rather than any small, minor mistakes - no matter HOW distracting. Chuck told\u00a0us about dreaming BIG again - as we did when we were young; and Richard was interviewed\u00a0by \"WPTR\u00a0DJ\" Kameel on the secret of success. Thanks to Kelsey for bringing table topics for our outdoor connection, and Lauren for telling us about penguins and an aspect of Montessori teaching.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\"&gt;<img src=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p> <p>Join us at Meetup.com<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Patuxent Toastmasters Club meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of\u00a0the month, upstairs\u00a0at the historic Oliver's Carriage House in downtown Columbia.<\/p> <p>We suggest that you arrive at 7:15 PM for some socializing; our\u00a0meetings begin promptly at 7:30 PM and end at approximately 9 PM. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bing.com\/maps\/#JnE9LjU0MTAlMmJMZWFmJTJiVHJlYWRlciUyYldheSUyNTJjJTJiQ29sdW1iaWElMjUyYyUyYk1EJTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTM5LjIyNzgyMDY4MDU\">MAP<\/a><\/p> <p>All are welcome. \u00a0Our club\u00a0offers a friendly, supportive, and\u00a0diverse\u00a0learning environment. \u00a0We have members from many different walks of life, ages, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities.\u00a0Although we meet in a community church, our club has no religious affiliations.<\/p> <p>Are you looking for speaking tips....go to toastmasters international\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.PatuxentToastmasters.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup\/events\/228924877\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters International Speech Contest","id":"228924877","time":1457051400000,"updated":1457059128000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397935971000,"name":"Toastmasters District 18 Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":13996962,"urlname":"Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"2600 N.

We'll talk about what's on trend currently and how to capture a candid fresh shot filled with personality. A great headshot is vital for your social media presence. I will shoot and edit one headshot for every attendee.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/b\/2\/600_446546802.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Late Snack and Q&amp;A session **Snacks will be provided.**<\/p> <p><br\/>We have the Jackson family who will be joining us for Baby's Violet's first milestone session.

Dancing to wonderful music and rhythms, we join the circle of grandmothers who initiated these dances and passed them on. Dancing in their footsteps, we experience a sense of something greater than ourselves, a continuum of which we are a sacred part. The dances evoke a powerful sense of community and interconnection with each other and all life.<\/p> <p>In February we are still in the presence of winter, the season that calls us to rest and rejuvenate, to listen quietly and deeply to our inner being, our desires, our visions in preparation for the coming spring.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yet stillness can be challenging as the energies of spring begin to rise up! Mother Earth is busy deep within right now, teaming with life below the surface. And so are we!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Traditional Chinese Medicine explains that, in early spring, as the virgin green color fills the branches and the tree fills with the sap of life, the tree feels its potential rising up within it, along with a profound sense of being pent-up. It feels, as we feel, this pressure gradually building within, but does not yet know what it is or how it will appear; for only when its leaves burst out in the latter months of spring will its manifestation become apparent. So with us, the rising sap [can be] experienced both as joy as well as anger and impatience; trusting that this will soon find resolution can be helpful. As a Zen koan says: 'Sitting quietly, doing nothing, spring comes and the grass grows by itself.'\" ~ Jason Elias, Five Element Healing<\/p> <p>In this workshop, we will dance to honor this transition from winter to spring, the dance between stillness, restlessness and action. Rooting into the ground as we rise up, we will dance to cultivate the mindfulness needed to move forward into spring with clarity, creativity, flexibity, peace and joy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>No dance experience is required, as the dances are simple to moderately easy, and the step sequences repetitive.

Feb. 7 at 6 PM<\/b><\/p> <p>Rick Wiebush of Cross Currents Sea Kayaking has been able to get a limited number of pool sessions for CKA members this winter. These sessions are designed to help you learn to roll or improve your existing roll. They will be taught by ACA certified instructors (Mike Hamilton and Tom Malone) who are expert rollers and very supportive teachers.<\/p> <p>This class will be held at the Catonsville YMCA on Saturday\u00a0March 5\u00a0from 7 - 9 PM.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/3\/600_445724467.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What to Expect<\/b><\/p> <p>The rolling instruction will be for 1 hour 15 minutes. You will then have an additional 45 minutes of pool time to practice what you've learned, or practice other skills, or just chill out.<\/p> <p>The classes are small with just three students for each instructor. This insures that you will get plenty of attention during the session. Enrollment is limited to six people.<\/p> <p>Rolling isn't something that most people learn to do with just one lesson. So it would be best to expect that you won't actually roll. However, you will get the basic mechanics and components of your roll. Then it is a matter of a lot of practice and probably additional instruction.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We usually go out to a local bar\/restaurant afterwards.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/7\/600_445724471.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What you need<\/b><\/p> <p>1. a boat that fits you i.e. one that you do not slide all around in and fall out of as soon as you turn upside down, In general, rec boats are not good for learning to roll.<\/p> <p>2. A spray skirt that stays on the boat when you go upside down. You can't learn to roll if your spray skirt comes off by itself every time you go over.<\/p> <p>3. Warm clothing if you get cold easily. The pool is heated but some people get cold after spending so much time in the water. If you get cold easily it might be wise to wear some type of wet suit, like a farmer john or jane.<\/p> <p>4. A change of clothes. There are lockers and showers available.<\/p> <p>5. A positive attitude and a view that it is ok to not succeed on your first set of attempts.<\/p> <p>6. It is helpful is you already know how to do a wet exit. But if not, that is the very first thing you'll do at these sessions.<\/p> <p>Note: If you want to learn to roll but don't have the right kind of boat,\u00a0Chuck can make a couple of appropriate boats available.\u00a0 The rental fee is just $15 for the two hours (spray skirt included).<\/p> <p><b>Cost and Payment<\/b><\/p> <p>The cost for these sessions is $55. Here's how that breaks down: $20 for the pool + $5 for insurance + $30 for the lesson. $30 for a 75 minute rolling lesson is a fabulous price.\u00a0 Add $15 if you need a rental.<\/p> <p>You must pay when you register. Pay via Pay Pal here.<\/p> <p>Refunds will only be available if there is a waiting list and someone actually takes your spot.

Mahler and Shostakovich are among the most important figures in the development of the symphony as a form, and the carriers of the traditions from late romanticism to modernism. Mahler had a clear influence in the compositional style of Shostakovich, so having both composers in the same program is a logical association that makes sense artistically. The featured performer, <b>Lynn Harrell<\/b>, has become known as one of the world's finest cellists, performing internationally as a recitalist, chamber musician, and soloist with leading orchestras and ensembles. His presence is felt throughout the musical world. A consummate soloist, chamber musician, recitalist, conductor and teacher, his work throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia has placed him in the highest echelon of today\u2019s performing artists. Tonight he will be playing the violoncello, an early 16th century predecessor to the modern cello.<\/p> <p>The violoncello is played seated, with the instrument upright between the musician\u2019s knees. An endpin or spike \u2013 an innovation from the late 18th century \u2013 allows the violoncello to be comfortably balanced on the floor.

Different from medical ethics focused on individual patients, a code of public health ethics sets a framework for making decisions on policies that have a broad impact on the health of the population. Kathleen will reveal the emerging approach to such a code, looking at the issues public health professionals should consider before advocating for or implementing public health policy, including evaluating the evidence base, identifying potential burdens, seeking to minimize the harms, and enhancing the health of the disadvantaged.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:<\/b> Professor Kathleen Hoke is the director of the Network for Public Health Law (NPHL).

The Queer Queens of Qomedy are coming back to Baltimore! Magooby\u2019s Joke House, in Timonium on March 6th, 5:00PM. March 6th national headliner Poppy Champlin is bringing her highly sought after and herlarious comedy troupe The Queer Queens of Qomedy show to Magooby\u2019s in Timonium. The Q3 show has been touring for eleven years and comic producer Poppy Champlin had such a wonderful reception in Balmore last year she is returning for more. Champlin is bringing two of her lesbian pals and nationally known comics Karen Williams and Mimi Gonzalez to share the bill Saturday March 6th at 5:00. Magooby\u2019s is a great venue to see this comedy show, the food is great the staff is wonderful and the community is welcome. Poppy is a national headliner with television credits including LOGO, Showtime, HBO, VH-1, Comedy Central, and more. Karen Williams has been leading the charge in the lesbian community for years. Karen has her own LOGO comedy special called \u201c I need a snack.\u201d She is a mother and a grandmother and now she is focusing on \u201chealing with humor\u201d at her HaHa Institute in Ohio. A regular in P-town and on Olivia Cruises Karen is a national lesbian treasure. The third Queen to rule this stage is Mimi Gonzalez, a road tested, high octane, Latina comic that has appeared on LOGO, The Today Show, and The Latino Laugh Festival. Mimi\u2019s refreshing verve for life and justice is inspiring. This show is going to be coming to you in black and white and brown and it will be a full night of wet your pants funny. Come prepared. Opening the show is local musical talent Angelique Henle. Henle\u2019s folk-rock style has been compared to that of Jewel and Sarah McLachlan. Tickets are $25 for General admission and $40 for VIP which includes a meet and greet with the comedians before the show with wine and cheese and preferred seating.
