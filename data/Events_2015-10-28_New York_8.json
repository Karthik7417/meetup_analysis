Furthermore, the path that the facts about the cultivation of agency points to bears a strong resemblance to many aspects of ancient Stoicism. Perfection of agency looks in many ways like the classical virtues. And its culmination bears a strong resemblance to sagehood.<\/p> <p>In short, Becker claims that modern day reasoning and facts leads to a new Stoicism.<\/p> <p>In this meetup, we'll explore Becker's descriptive argument concerning perfected agency as virtue covered in most of Chapter 6. To prepare, read most, but not all, of Chapter 6 from the beginning up the chapter up to (but not including) the section entitled \"The Argument for Virtue as the Perfection of Agency\".

Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.

Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet.

But beneath the surface, she is consumed by thoughts of her sister\u2019s death years earlier in Nigeria. Ella had introduced Angie to Black Power and a vision of returning to Africa. On impulse, Angie travels to Lagos and begins to retrace Ella\u2019s steps.

EFT is a simple yet incredibly effective method of self healing that can be used to immediately reduce anxiety, stress, and other emotions that stand in our way of living in a place of optimum well-being and personal peace. Together we will do lots of EFT tapping to work on individual and collective issues of concern. The more of us who tap together in a group format, the more benefit can be received by all.<\/p> <p>At this meetup we will continue exploring the nature of our mind and emotions and learn how to identify \u2018stories\u2019 we tell about ourselves that contribute to any sense of personal 'Not-OKness'. Then we can release the charge these stories carry with EFT and increase our personal Emotional Freedom!<\/p> <p><br\/>One of the special features of our Meetup is that we demonstrate how we have unconscious blocks to happiness and Emotional Freedom. Using Energetic Rescripting Process (ERP), a technique that borrows from Kinesiology and EFT, we locate the nature of these blocks and remove them.<\/p> <p><br\/>Even from the demos we do in our Meetups\u00a0people get back to me with\u00a0remarkable stories of how things in their life are shifting\u00a0for the better!<\/p> <p><br\/>Registration for this meeting is requested but not required. There is a nominal $5 charge although a donation of $15-$20 to benefit New Dawn Foundation is suggested.<\/p> <p><br\/>All are welcome (adults 17 and up who are emotionally comfortable in group settings).<\/p> <p>Those new to EFT are asked to join our meetup group to have access to a variety of useful information and resources about EFT (listed under to MORE\/FILES tab of this meetup site). <a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/1785548\/Managing%20Stress%20with%20EFT.pdf\">Click here to read a primer about using EFT.<\/a><\/p> <p>You can also find instructional videos and more posted on our new Emotional Freedom Facebook page:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/EFTforEmotionalFreedom\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/EFTforEmotionalFreedom\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/EFTforEmotionalFreedom<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Being already somewhat familiar with EFT will help to minimize our time explaining why we are tapping and saying these strange things, and maximize our time sharing from our personal experiences and using our techniques to release the emotions that no longer serve our well being.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Its a bit sneaky to find... continue down Davenport ave past the beach clubs and marinas and just past Imperial Yacht club there's a tiny driveway entrance with a sign and mailbox that says New Dawn Foundation...

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

The clear must ferments slowly in 500-liter oak barrels so it becomes quite stable naturally. It matured in those oak barrels for 14-15 months. It has a Burgundian nose, with subtle oak and orange peel, hints of pollen, and beeswax. The palate is very fresh, the grapes were harvested quite early to keep the acidity. The wine ends quite austere. Only part of it went through malolactic fermentation.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Chacra Cincuenta y Cinco Pinot Noir (Rio Negro, Patagonia)\u00a0 $40<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 A very elegant, subtle wine that is light-colored and has floral (roses, lilies) notes alongside wild strawberries and raspberries. It feels light but has very good concentration of flavors and enough clout, while keeping the poise. The tannins feel very refined, there is good freshness and acidity. It should have a very nice evolution in bottle. This would be the proverbial iron fist in a velvet glove.

It is very much about the soil, not much about the fruit, but its youth is revealed in the notes of the elevage that are still there: that is cedar wood, peat and graphite. Summarizing, this is an austere, serious, long, tight red that has great potential to age.

Very svelte, delivering luscious licorice and spice notes, which linger on the finish with baker's chocolate details.<\/p> <p><b>2006 Carmelo Patti Cabernet Sauvignon (Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon from Perdriel shows orange tints denoting its age. Carmelo Patti likes to release his wines after a long aging in the winery, when he thinks they are ready to drink. There are plenty of aromas of tea leaves, paprika, hints of leather and cured meat plus dried flowers and something earthy. The austere palate shows fully resolved tannins. There is nothing lush about this wine. This superb classically styled Cabernet is tasty, long, and ready to drink. If you want to see what Cabernet can do in Argentina this is a good example. This is like time-traveling.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Achaval Ferrer Quimera (Mendoza)\u00a0 $36<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 92<\/i> \u2013 This dark, compact red leads with a floral note to the racy cassis and cherry puree fruit, well-integrated with fine tannins and bright acidity.

The menu includes, but is not limited to: smoked salmon and smoked trout with a cucumber dill salad, roasted salmon with cous cous and spinach, homemade pasta of the day, chicken with mushroom sauce, beef bourguignon, ending with a medley of French desserts.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Travel-and-Dinner-Group-for-Mature-Adults\/events\/225402393\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"La Boite En Bois","id":"225402393","time":1445207400000,"updated":1445219542000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434222111000,"name":"Travel and Dinner Group for Mature Adults","group_lon":-74,"id":18670474,"urlname":"Travel-and-Dinner-Group-for-Mature-Adults","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"48 Wall Street (5th Floor)","name":"Brooklyn Ark (Manhattan Campus)","lon":-74.009041,"id":24109103,"state":"NY","lat":40.706566,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.16892170906,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444193482000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Welcome! \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brooklynark.com\/\">Brooklyn Ark<\/a> (Manhattan Campus)\u00a0is an exciting church that meets on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.\u00a0 If you are looking for a church, a place to make and meet friends, or a space to wrestle with the deep questions of life, this is a perfect place for you.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWHEN WE MEET<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Sunday Evening Service at 6:30pm with after-party networking\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Sunday Morning Service at 11:00am <i>starting Sunday, November 1st with after-party networking\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Get connected at the many mid-week Bible studies and community events throughout the week.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWHERE WE MEET\u00a0<\/p> <p>*48 Wall Street (5th Floor), Manhattan, NY (Financial District)\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>*Take any of these convenient lines: 2\/3, J\/Z, and 4\/5.

In just 18 months Somtum Der Bangkok has been warmly embraced by locals, expatriates and tourists.

I do notice the people who RSVP and then cancel which really isn't fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean or anything but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Also even if the meetup is full please do put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. I will also try to give an idea in advance if it looks like there might be more spots. Also, if there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to succeed. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

How might individuals\u2019 ethnicity, gender, race, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic level affect their perspective on design? The conversation will explore these and other pressing questions as it probes the complicated relationship between diversity and design.

He'll talk about their localization process (and why we stopped using Google's app translation service), strategies for avoiding layout issues (with some examples of embarrassing ones), date &amp; time formatting, sorting (which turns out not to even be computable for some languages), and why all this localization work still isn't enough. Plus he'll try to share some numbers from Meetup's recent launch in Japanese.<\/p> <p>\n\n<i>\"How Do We Show All This Stuff\" by Liam Spradlin, mobile designer at touchlab. <\/i><br\/>He'll talk about information density vs. hierarchy, why white space isn't wasted space, and dealing with showing too much data.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>\"Sympli: Collaboration for Designers and Developers\" by\u00a0<\/i><i>Max Ignatyev, Founder of Sympli\u00a0<\/i><br\/>As we all know, designers and developers speak very different languages. \u00a0Max Ignatyev was the lead Developer on the Washington Post app and had issues going back and forth between designers (trying to figure out where files where, what colors were used, distances, etc.) and it would take hours for him to get this information, having no way to efficiently communicate with other people on his team. In order to overcome that, he actually created Sympli, which functions as a plugin for Photoshop, Sketch, Xcode and Android Studio, and also has a web app so that that back and forth communication and sharing would happen in 1-click.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe also have news about<b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bigapps.nyc\/p\/\">NYC Big Apps<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 Opportunity to win $25K:<br\/><\/b><i>NYC is awarding $25K to a solution to improve the way New Yorkers experience living in NYC.

Originally conceived as a list of life lessons for her future children, the author warns that the collection is not intended for an actual child unless he is capable of \u201cusing the F word at least three ways in a sentence.\u201d Childhood (and in particular, her near-obsession with her unibrow, tweezed at age 12), adolescence, and the trials and tribulations of young adulthood (shopping, driving, sexuality) are explored along with such random topics as how to clean a stairway while listening to \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d and how to construct a Tootsie Roll log cabin. A child of the \u201980s born of hippie parents, LaMarche is now a new mother in her 30s; her observations on parenting and marriage are especially humorous, including a brief index of common parenting mistakes, in which she shoots down both sides of such questions as whether to breastfeed, co-sleep, use disposable diapers, etc. LaMarche is entertaining and fresh; readers will want to savor this sassy, offbeat commentary<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club\/events\/223563140\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Author Event - Una LaMarche - Unabrow.","id":"223563140","time":1445293800000,"updated":1445560526000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1300804164000,"name":"The New York Girly Book Club","group_lon":-74,"id":1802703,"urlname":"The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 675-6056","address_1":"75 Christopher St (at 7th Ave)","name":"Fat Cat - Music & Games","lon":-74.003204,"id":672565,"state":"NY","lat":40.733562,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.33237087727,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443628138000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"Click on Fat Cat Music & Games for directions, we are in the back towards the left","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pingpong-67\/events\/225727670\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":10800000,"name":"The NY Table Tennis Group","id":"225727670","time":1445293800000,"updated":1445306261000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1171226481000,"name":"The NY Table Tennis Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":426897,"urlname":"pingpong-67","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"NY Table Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Sleepy Hollow","address_1":"199 N Broadway","name":"Immaculate Conception Church","lon":-73.858612,"id":22593032,"lat":41.08284,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.0472011566,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1417998639000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us for another wonderful evening of Line Dancing instruction as well as reviews. $10 admission at the door, 6:30-9:30pm.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Benefits of regular practice include improving health, energy and vitality; enhancing mental focus, memory and clarity; reducing stress and establishing a deep sense of peace and inner balance.<\/p> <p>Isha Kriya is a gentle, seated practice, which can be practiced in a chair.<b>\u00a0No previous meditation experience is necessary.<\/b><\/p> <p><i>The Isha Kriya process was developed by realized yogi, Sadhguru Vasudev.

ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other.

Tony was raised in Bellingham, Washington (90 miles north of Seattle) and spent most of his time as a child exploring the woods behind his parents house. At 19 after visiting Bruce Lee's grave in Seattle, and taking his first photo with a disposable camera, he bought his first camera. He promptly broke it and bought his first SLR. At 21 he moved to Seattle to pursue photography and in fall of 2000 moved to NYC, the center of the world.<\/p> <p>Tony teaches photographic lighting at FIT in NYC, he has also taught at Parsons the New School for Design and SVA in NYC, judged photo contests, and has traveled the country leading workshops for American Photographic Artists.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/9\/4\/600_443025460.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops\/events\/226023169\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":12600000,"name":"Shooting Landscapes with the Sony a7R II with Tony Gale","id":"226023169","time":1445371200000,"updated":1445384917000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1396546420000,"name":"Free NYC Photography Workshops","group_lon":-74,"id":13710502,"urlname":"Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Photographers & Videographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1300 York Avenue","name":"Weill Cornell Medical College","lon":-73.954788,"id":24158545,"state":"NY","lat":40.764992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.11826133728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445193181000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/1\/9\/600_443180761.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>During protest #2, students, faculty and staff at Weill Cornell Medicine where Dr. Glimcher is the Dean, were given a handout defending Dr. Glimcher, and they were asked to ignore us.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including KAULDER, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful QUEEN WITCH, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the QUEEN curses KAULDER with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today KAULDER is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to KAULDER, the QUEEN WITCH is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race.<\/p> <p><b>Social Media\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Hashtag:\u00a0 #LastWitchHunter #AxeAndCross<\/p> <p>Facebook: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Twitter \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Instagram:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>IN THEATRES OCTOBER 23<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Tickets will be under NYC Dads Group list with your name.

Hazelcast provides many distributed and highly scalable data structures such as Map, Queue, Lock and Executor Service. It also has many powerful capabilities like listeners, WAN replication, and query functionality. It is possible to implement applications that are very scalable and capable. However, power comes with responsibility and misuse can cause degrading performance and application scalability. In this talk, we will talk about some of the best practices and mistakes to avoid while using Hazelcast. We assume that the audience is familiar with Hazelcast or an alternative IMDG. You will leave this session knowing the core principles and best practices for the following features: - WAN Replication<br\/>- Queries<br\/>- Listeners<br\/>- Executor Service<br\/>- Queue<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Introduction to Hazelcast Discovery SPI<\/b><\/p> <p>This is a short session that gives you a preview into the Discover Client SPI, and how you can leverage it to bring Hazelcast to even more cloud platforms! \u00a0We'll take a look at challenges that Ray ran into prior to the SPI when trying to use Hazelcast on Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes. \u00a0With the SPI, it's now very easy to implement Hazelcast node discovery for many different cloud platforms.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Ray Tsang<\/b> is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.

And in return, you can get the help you need for your project.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here\u2019s how it works; join the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodnik.net\/communities\/blacks-in-technology\">Blacks-In-Technology community on Goodnik.net <\/a>and fill out a profile that includes the skills you have, and then fill out <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/jfd3jYi7Ma\">this questionnaire<\/a> about what kind of help or advice you are looking for. On the evening of the event, we will pair you up with an expert who can provide professional guidance on a subject that you need help with, whether that\u2019s marketing, business development, design, legal, accounting or something else. You will have about 20 minutes to get the advice you need, and then the roles will reverse and you will be paired with someone you can help with your skill set. It\u2019s a great way to get to know each other and find the help you need to grow your business, and help someone else grow their business too.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blacksintech\/events\/225420971\/\">meetup.com\/blacksintech<\/a> so we have everyone on one RSVP page.<\/p> <p><b>Event schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>6:30-7:00pm: Intro and mingling<\/p> <p>7:00-7:20pm: Skill swap A-&gt;B<\/p> <p>7:20-7:30: transition<\/p> <p>7:30-7:50pm: Skill swap B-&gt;A<\/p> <p>7:50-8:00pm: wrap up<\/p> <p>After the event, you will be able to use the Goodnik.net site to find expert advisors to help you with your business, and find others you can help in return.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/226067301\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytnbbc","time":1445380200000,"updated":1445393334000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 228-6226","address_1":"248 Mercer St (between 3rd St and 4th St)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-74,"id":490856,"state":"NY","lat":40.72,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415805169000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to make comics but you're feeling stuck?

As a young woman, Gbowee was broken by the Liberian civil war, a brutal conflict that tore apart her life and claimed the lives of countless relatives and friends. As a young mother trapped in a nightmare of domestic abuse, she found the courage to turn her bitterness into action, propelled by her realization that it is women who suffer most during conflicts--and that the power of women working together can create an unstoppable force. In 2003, the passionate and charismatic Gbowee helped organize and then led the Liberian Mass Action for Peace, a coalition of Christian and Muslim women who sat in public protest, confronting Liberia's ruthless president and rebel warlords, and even held a sex strike.

Rosenbloom's first company Handshake.com offered web software that enabled consumers to automatically schedule services with a variety of service businesses. But the company strayed from its original mission and attempted to build a big web front-end to drive customers to its business customers. In the end, this proved cost-ineffective and was dropped. \"After raising over $20M in financing, I realized we may have overfunded the business,\" Rosenbloom recalls.<\/p> <p><br\/>\"I learned a lot then that I applied to the founding of Brontes,\" referring to the dental imaging company that he co-founded with Founder Collective partner Eric Paley. \"You have to be extremely disciplined. You have to be careful not to become too dependent on venture capital and build a real business.\" But fortunately, Brontes was allowed to grow on its own, on a trim budget, before it was sold.<\/p> <p>Before entering the start-up world, Rosenbloom put in time at the Endeavor talent agency in Los Angeles. There, he briefly worked as an assistant to one of the agents at the agency famed for being the backdrop of the HBO hit series Entourage (\"I was Lloyd, essentially,\" Rosenbloom says). \"Hollywood is surprisingly similar to venture capital,\" he remarks. \"It's about bringing the script, the star, and some of the writers together around a great project.\"<br\/>Rosenbloom sees Founder Collective's advantage as its ability and willingness, as a committed early-stage investor, to play an active role in supporting and digging into the endeavors it backs, rather than sitting passively by and hoping for the best. \"We're really hands-on guys,\" he says of Founder Collective's founding partners. \"We're not career investors, we're start-up guys. With early-stage stuff, you can get really hands-on, and put things together and shepherd things along, and I think we're in a good position to do that. I think the strategy plays really well to our strengths.\" He also noted Founder Collective's advantage vis-a-vis larger funds: \"there's a gap in terms of where the funding is. Big funds have to go after big deals, but we're not such a small fund that we can only put in $200,000--we can go quite a bit further.\"<br\/>In late 2010 Micah helped co-found Sample6, a company developing breakthrough technologies to better protect the food supply. \"I've tried to stay away from following trends and build stuff that has a tangible impact on humanity.\"<\/p> <p>Having built 3 start-ups and raised 4 rounds of venture capital, Micah has now joined Founder Collective full-time to lead the NYC office. \u201cThe NY scene is truly energized right now, and I want to help entrepreneurs build the next generation of great companies here and beyond.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/njtech\/events\/221555230\/","yes_rsvp_count":90,"name":"NJ Tech Meetup 65 w\/ Micah Rosenbloom, Founder Collective (Managing Partner)","id":"221555230","time":1445381100000,"updated":1445455069000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1271697765000,"name":"NJ Tech Meetup","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1633095,"urlname":"njtech","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NJ Tech'ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07302","country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"121 Newark Ave, 5th Floor","name":"Indiegrove - Coworking Space","lon":-74.043144,"id":11419962,"state":"NJ","lat":40.720016,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.47607040405,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438031765000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A \u201cprompt\u201d is a writing exercise with a specific theme and a time limit.

Healing happens on many levels at The Love Guru's healing events. New awarenesses, insights and healing will come through for you during the event and in the days that follow. Remember to drink plenty of water during and after the event to clear toxins and old ways of being that are released from being at the event. The information shared will give you a new way of being and creating healthy relationships in all areas of your life!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTICKET POLICY: All tickets must be pre-paid. No cash is accepted at the door. There are no refunds and no exceptions. If you are unable to make the event, you can transfer your ticket to a friend before the day of the event (only) and must email me to let me know who is taking your place before 12PM noon.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFINAL NOTE: If your pattern and pain of emotional abuse is not taken care of, learned from and healed, it'll lead you down a hole of feeling helpless, hopeless, angry and sad. You'll avoid intimate relationships and the idea of becoming intimate with someone will be a source of anxiety, depression and fear. Join us at the event to take back your life!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nABOUT THE LOVE GURU:<\/p> <p>The Love Guru Blaire is a Spiritual Teacher, Intuitive Heart Healer, Psychic\/Medium, Love Expert, and Marriage and Family Therapist. Although I am trained as a Marriage and Family Therapist, I work as an Intuitive Heart Healer. This was a gift I was born with and developed over the years. It's the gift to open and heal your heart so you can attract the love and have the relationship (and the life) you desire. I help my clients heal their issues from the root. This way you never have to deal with the same pain again. 60% of clients come to me after they've been in and out of weekly therapy over a 5-10 year time span with little to no results. Creating a dependency is not my objective (quite the opposite, I empower you). When we work together, deep rooted issues get resolved fast. I help clients clear and heal emotional baggage, relationship traumas and blocks that they've been struggling with for OVER 20 YEARS -- WITHIN 3 MONTHS.<\/p> <p>At this event, I'll share my experience with emotional abuse and how I healed my part in the pattern. I'll talk about how I got into my power and how I will never be abused in any relationship ever again. I will guide you through practical tips and techniques on how you can do this too. When you heal that wounded part inside of yourself (and we all have wounded parts) you experience freedom in your life like you have never experienced before. Join me for this powerful event so you can escape this nightmare of a relationship and stop the pattern from continuing, because as you will learn, just because you leave the man or woman who was emotionally abusive to you, this pattern repeats over and over again until you heal what's causing it from within you.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nRAVE REVIEWS FROM PAST EVENTS<\/p> <p>\"Good to see you in the flesh last night.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

Speech can be to oneself in thought, locally to other people in person, propagated generally in media, exchanged universally as money, or systemically distributed as rules and laws.\u00a0 While in person speech is often informal, the use of money and law as speech are formal.\u00a0 Money can be seen as a way of codifying speech into a numerical value and law as way of coding speech into a system of hexadecimal representations of speech.\u00a0 These two operations of communicating via formal codifications are what we do with pen &amp; paper, but more specifically what we do with a computer though a web browser or application.\u00a0 We will be exploring what can be codified into computational form and what cannot.\u00a0 Specifically, we will explore the answer to the questions: \u201cWhat errors arise from this codification process?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat is lost through formalization?\u201d &amp; \u201cWhat modeling capacities are gained through the formalization process?\u201d \u00a0<\/p> <p>Perspective:<\/p> <p>We are able to measure the social world to exact numerical representations with specific laws that must be obeyed.\u00a0 We collapse our spontaneous communicative activity into formal routines in organizations, measurable profit mechanisms, and sometimes even actual computer programs that replace human activity.\u00a0 This reduces the mystery of modern life, yet creates its own complexity as the algorithms, data sets, equations, and textual formalities that both generate our modern world from within and model it from the outside.\u00a0 Our informal interactions now take place within a nexus of complex functions, which tune into our activity as \u2018surveillance\u2019 and ask for input as \u2018feedback.\u2019\u00a0 Yet, as mathematicians, we have a unique ability to interact with these complex systems and create our own.\u00a0 The political economy of mathematics asks how we use this capacity for the pursuit of the political-economic good and the mathematics of political economy asks for the correct way of formally abstracting the complex functions (both implicit and explicit) operating in our modern world.\u00a0 What is the good from the perspective of mathematics?\u00a0 What methods and models can help us attain the good?<\/p> <p>Mathematical Modeling:<\/p> <p>Some social-institutional processes are already formalized, such as in economic, legal, and organizational domains.\u00a0 There complexity can be reduced through higher level mathematical abstractions describing their flows.\u00a0 Other processes are implicit, such as ideation, informal communication, and social-historical transformations.\u00a0 These are delicate and demand an attainment to the object being abstracted.\u00a0 They can be given formal rules via theorization and practical interventions.\u00a0 These can be formalized into mathematical notation to constitute logical domains, with clearly defined operations and functions.\u00a0 The difficulty in abstracting informal activity is not losing sight of the original object, which may be difficult to point to, isolate, or preserve since it is often immaterial and transitory. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Values:<\/p> <p>Ultimately an analysis of everyday life must model and enable values, as in good\/bad, justice\/injustice, love\/hate, peace\/violence, truth\/lies, creation\/destruction, happiness\/sadness, virtue\/vice.\u00a0 Often these take the functional form of dichotomies, with an operator and inverse operator, and can be arranged into algebraic structures for the sake of a specific research agenda. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Research:<\/p> <p>Modeling begins with a theoretical definition of terms that captures a certain essence of the term and fixes its relationship to other terms under study.\u00a0 The research may say in the apriori realm or may seek to be filled by empirical work, either as textual or real number inputs.\u00a0 Ethnography, surveying, and data collection can be performed in person or with the aid of online communication platforms. \u00a0<\/p> <p>A Complex Political Economy:<\/p> <p>Rather than attempting political economy through the standard method of econometrics (real analysis), we will be describing political economy through complex analysis, where \"i\" designates the unmeasurable space of ideas emanating from individual persons, spoken in thought or communicated as meaning.\u00a0 This imaginary component of speech situates itself in phenomenological idealism (Hegel) while the real component of speech in its formal material reality (Marx) is realized through computer systems economic value, and legal codes.\u00a0 Values, as is often taken to be \u2018morality\/immorality,\u2019 mediate between these imaginary and real components of our formal analysis.<\/p> <p>Justice &amp; Violence<\/p> <p>Justice is the distribution of what is deserved.\u00a0 It is a value that corrects errors in political economy by aligning the real distribution of goods to their imaginary presuppositions.\u00a0 Violence, as occurs within injustice, is the degradation of imaginary ideals by the incorrect distribution of real goods.\u00a0 Just political institutions are formal systems that increase the imaginary components of persons belonging to and constituting the political whole.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Measuring Speech:<\/p> <p>Habermas\u2019 universal pragmatics distinguishes speech claims by their illocutionary effect (transmitting intended meaning) and perlocutionary effect (opening intersubjective meanings).\u00a0 This distinction within speech acts cuts upon instrumental speech and communicative, that is speech that is aimed at transforming the state of affairs vs. speech that is aimed at inquiring and understanding. Instrumental speech actions \u2018formalize\u2019 themselves, which is to say that they institute themselves in reality as true propositions.\u00a0 Interpretive speech actions ask about the truths of other persons and reality, leaving themselves as \u2018informal.\u2019\u00a0 In the space of speech actions, we can thus distinguish those that are formal, and thus able to be represented by real numbers, and those that are informal, and thus unable to be mapped to real numbers.\u00a0 The \u2018system\u2019 is the real measure that maps formal speech acts to real numbers, while the \u2018lifeworld\u2019 is the function from informal speech acts to imaginary numbers.\u00a0 Together, this allows us to generate a complex measure from all speech acts to the imaginary &amp; real planes.<\/p> <p>Computer System:<\/p> <p>I will built an online computer system, Mimely, that can be used for interactive research into social reality.\u00a0 I will show it briefly to the group.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please Join us at 7pm: https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/events\/ctutkq2c8qulj008gea15vaviqc","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MATHEMATICS-ACADEMY-MATH-CLUB\/events\/225825361\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Complex Analysis of Systemic Speech","id":"225825361","time":1445384700000,"updated":1445398539000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1242861261000,"name":"Mathematics Academy Math Club - New York City","group_lon":-74,"id":1459657,"urlname":"MATHEMATICS-ACADEMY-MATH-CLUB","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Mathematicians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"61 4th Ave, (near Astor Place)by donation212-475-6650","name":"Three Jewels NYC","lon":-74.005943,"id":24116323,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445215112000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>All are Welcome to our new QiGong\/Tai Chi class.
