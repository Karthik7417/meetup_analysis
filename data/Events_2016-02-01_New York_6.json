For many of these unfortunate creatures, that means the agony lasts for minutes or even hours!<\/p> <p>These helpless animals are tortured and killed in the most horrifically cruel ways imaginable - all for vain, pretentious, human notions of \"luxury apparel\" and \"fashion.\" Jump into the ongoing campaign to STOP this insanity and work toward the total abolition of the global fur industry.

And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are.

It is based on the belief that we have two thoughts systems, one based on fear and separation from the Divine and another one based on love and oneness with the Divine. The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

Since they are letting us use the space for free, they expect that we will order food and drink, so there are some rules:<\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 No outside food or drink, not even bottled water.<\/p> <p>2. Please plan on ordering food and\/or drinks.\u00a0 Support the venue.<\/p> <p>3. Tip the waitstaff generously.\u00a0 15% is standard, but 20% is even better.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.\u00a0<br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses\u00a0<br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.\u00a0<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you\u00a0<br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind\u00a0<br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.\u00a0<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

The sounds and vibrations of the gong create deep relaxation and state of meditation by altering brain waves from a Beta (waking state) to Theta &amp; Delta (deep meditation). Science teaches that during these brain frequencies we access our deeper subconscious and superconscious and they are key states for healing.<br\/>Many people have noticeable experiences during a Gong Bath.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p>Personal Branding with Purpose is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand. It's about learning how to live your personal brand by sharing your authentic self and communicating clearly the value you can provide others. Our passions, talents, and impact are unique gifts we can give to the world. By learning how to market these gifts through personal branding, you create not only career and business opportunities but also a greater capacity to make a difference in the lives of others and the planet.<\/p> <p><b>* Doors open at 6:45 PM, workshop starts at 7:00 PM sharp *<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WHAT YOU'LL LEARN\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0An understanding of personal branding- how you can leverage it to create new career and business opportunities as well as scale your impact<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Gain greater clarity about your passions, values, purpose, and career goals that serve as a foundation for an authentic personal brand<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Define your Big Idea - what you stand for - and integrate it with your unique knowledge and experience to communicate your brand value<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Identify your niche, target audience and articulate how you can help solve problems they have<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Assess and strategically build your online identity and presence|Develop strategies for maintaining and adapting your personal brand in a world of constant change<\/p> <p><b>WHO THIS CLASS IS FOR\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals looking to create new career and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0People seeking a new job or looking to make a career shift<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Entrepreneurs wanting to increase their own visibility to grow their businesses<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Creatives and service providers (consultants, coaches, agents, and speakers) wanting to attract new clients and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Students or recent grads looking to build a foundation for their future career path<\/p> <p><b>INSTRUCTOR BIO<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/1311863\/marcossalazarheadshot.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/\">Marcos Salazar<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcossalazar\">@marcossalazar<\/a>)\u00a0is a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">social entrepreneur<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#services\">career + life coach<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcossalazar.com\/consulting\">consultant<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#engage\">speaker<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">community builder<\/a>.

No better place to kick off the new year than with a Greenpoint, Brooklyn, read, right? Here's a bit about The Astral:<\/p> <p>\"Like the rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn of its setting, Christensen's unremittingly wonderful latest is populated by an odd but captivating mix of characters. At the center is Harry Quirk, a middle-aged poet whose comfortable life is upended one winter day when his wife, Luz, convinced he's having an affair, destroys his notebooks, throws his laptop from the window, and kicks him out. Things, Harry has to admit, are not going well: their idealistic Dumpster-diving daughter, Karina, is lonely and lovelorn, and their son, Hector, is in the grip of a messianic cult. Taking in a much-changed Greenpoint, Brooklyn, while working at a lumberyard and hoping to recover his poetic spark, Harry must come to terms with the demands of starting anew at 57. Astute and unsentimental, at once romantic and wholly rational, Harry is an everyman adrift in a changing world, and as he surveys his failings, Christensen takes a singular, genuine story and blows it up into a smart inquiry into the nature of love and the commitments we make, the promises we do and do not honor, and the people we become as we negotiate the treacherous parameters of marriage and friendship and parenthood.\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Astral-Novel-Kate-Christensen\/dp\/0385530919\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Astral-Novel-Kate-Christensen\/dp\/0385530919<\/a><\/p> <p>Have a wonderful holiday, and look forward to seeing you all in the new year!

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/228071017\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvcbzb","time":1453244400000,"updated":1453403812000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"224 West 4th street","address_2":"Second Floor","name":"fat cat fab lab","lon":-74.00296,"id":14148372,"state":"NY","lat":40.733955,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.30262732506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452709367000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tuesday is Arduino night at Fat Cat Fab Lab!\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We have lots more Arduinos, breadboards, and parts, so bring your laptop and come join us for a fun hands-on learning experience.<\/b><\/p> <p>This week will be more hands-on, we will be working at our main table hooking up Arduinos to \u00a0laptops, adding parts with\u00a0 solderless breadboards, and trying out and modifying example Arduino sketches ( sketches is the name for Arduino programs.)<\/p> <p>We now know from our first meeting, that everyone has different pet projects or reasons they are interesting in learning Arduino.\u00a0 Therefore, instead of having a main presentation each week on a specific sensor group or output device type, participants will work individually or in small groups on whatever they want to work on, and the host will assist when asked.\u00a0\u00a0 Going forward, we'll let the group decide what topics they are most interested in and schedule presentations as appropriate.<\/p> <p>Some short presentations on how to use standard electronics lab equipment like multimeters, oscilloscopes, waveform generators, and external regulated power supplies will prove useful in the near future as well as introductions to basic circuits and components: resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors, how to read datahseets, and more.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><b>Stewart Newfeld<\/b>, our Arduino Tuesdays host has a an Electrical Engineering degree from Rutgers University, years of industry experience, and loves to teach and share his enthusiasm for making things.\u00a0 He enjoys ordering those so-inexpensive electronic parts from ebay and Aliexpress and having them show up like little toys two to three weeks later in his mailbox.\u00a0 He is president of Zebra Systems, Inc. where he develops websites with the Joomla Open Source CMS.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/228062674\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":9000000,"name":"Have fun learning Arduino","id":"228062674","time":1453244400000,"updated":1453254376000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364936758000,"name":"fat cat FAB LAB","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":7890972,"urlname":"fat-cat-fab-lab","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"30 Irving Place","name":"Goethe Institut New York","lon":-73.987709,"id":24084416,"state":"NY","lat":40.734985,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.04653954506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452612709000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>At the January German Book Club meeting, we will discuss Klaus Modick's Konzert ohne Dichter (Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch, 2015.

Modern Ruin: A World\u2019s Fair Pavilion tells the story of the Pavilion from the glory days of the fair, through the years of neglect, up to present day advocacy. The filmmakers hope this project will be the first step in engaging and informing people about the structure in new and exciting ways. This whimsical, futuristic, and soaring piece of art, constructed for the 1964 fair, has been left abandoned for the greater part of 50 years. \u201cIt would be a shame if its story ended in demolition,\u201d says Matthew Silva, \u201cThe dreamers see beyond the cracks, rust, and neglect to a thriving community space that will serve New Yorkers for generations.\u201d The film\u2019s goal is to contribute to the re-imagining of Flushing Meadows Corona Park and eventually lead to the repurposing of this great icon. The New York State Pavilion is on its way to being properly restored and cared for and it is a direct result of this film. Since the movie's release the Queens borough president Melinda Katz has helped to secure about $8 million in funding for the rehabilitation of the Pavilion. The structure has also recently been repainted with a donation from The New York Structural Steel Painting Contractors\u2019 Association.

See a live demo; PackedQuadPrefixTree: A more compact and efficient alternative to QuadPrefixTree; FlexPrefixTree: A configurable spatial tree to balance index size with search speed; RptWithGeometrySpatialField: An RPT index paired with serialized geometry with an in-memory cache allows indexed shapes to be searched accurately and quickly; Geo3D: Polygons and other shapes computed on the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid. It\u2019s also very fast when point data is pre-converted to 3 dimensions; GeoPointField: A leaner alternative to RPT; BKDTree \/ BKDPointField: An experimental Lucene codec for spatial data.

While the Android platform offers some inherent security protections, developers are on the hook for implementing security within their applications. This presentation will focus on using Android and .NET APIs for building secure apps written in C#. We will first take a look at the architecture and security model for Android. We will examine how to securely store data on a device, how to communicate securely, and how to implement cryptographic solutions. Strategies for authenticating and authorizing users with Azure Mobile Services will be demonstrated to protect access to your application and data. Third party security libraries will be discussed, along with example implementations. The goal of this presentation is to leave developers with a set of security controls that they can build into their own applications without reinventing the wheel.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p>Jack is an Application Security Expert with over a decade of experience building, breaking, and securing complex systems.

A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/228053594\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvcbzb","time":1453246200000,"updated":1453259149000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Parsippany","address_1":"99 US Highway 46","name":"Cycle Craft Parsippany","lon":-74.348915,"id":24062742,"state":"NJ","lat":40.858036,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.2423801422,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451319533000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Learn to change a flat tire with confidence.

The benefits are astounding! Sharing your core truth and living your purpose is deeply pleasurable and incredibly satisfying. Most women are blocked from accessing her core power, her true awareness of self. Soul Therapy is an evolutionary embodiment of exploring your humanness from the SOUL level.<\/p> <p>During our time together you will be asked five questions that will lead you into greater awareness of who you are, why you get stuck, what your soul wants to communicate to you, how to manifest your dreams and how to love yourself. If you have ever wanted to tap into your unlimited potentiality and be happy in the flow of life with less stress, now is the time to do so.<\/p> <p>Your soul is the guardian and gatekeeper to your true self. Your authentic voice is the one main requirement that resides within you and provides ample opportunities for you to listen, grow and expand. Most people don\u2019t know how to listen or understand how to embrace your soul\u2019s wisdom and knowledge. Soul Therapy Seminars are designed to show you how to remove the barriers that stop you from experiencing and loving a fully expressed, evolutionary life!<\/p> <p>Carolyn Goldfarb will support and guide you along the way.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.soultherapyschool.com\/carolyn-goldfarb-2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.soultherapyschool.com\/carolyn\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.soultherapyschool.com\/carolyn<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soul-Therapy-for-Women-Rye-New-York\/events\/227974044\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"Introduction To Soul Therapy","id":"227974044","time":1453246200000,"updated":1453320690000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452271218000,"name":"Soul Therapy for Women - Rye New York","group_lon":-73.6900024414,"id":19302867,"urlname":"Soul-Therapy-for-Women-Rye-New-York","group_lat":40.9799995422,"who":"Divine Feminine Soul Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445024139000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This event is a duplicate!

A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach\u2019s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students.<\/p> <p>Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations. Step by step, she leads us to trust our innate goodness, showing how we can develop the balance of clear-sightedness and compassion that is the essence of this book. \u00a0Radical \u00a0Acceptance does not mean self-indulgence or passivity. Instead it empowers genuine change: healing fear and shame and helping to build loving, authentic relationships. When we stop being at war with ourselves, we are free to live fully every precious moment of our lives.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the group in the glass-enclosed dining room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club\/events\/226225551\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Monthly Book Discussion","id":"pkpvklyvcbqb","time":1453249800000,"updated":1453385460000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1291650343000,"name":"Bay Ridge Book, Game and Social Club","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1747047,"urlname":"Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"388 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217","name":"The Commons","lon":0,"id":23955936,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.87486743927,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452721463000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come kick off the first NWL meeting of 2016 by celebrating the 43rd Anniversary of Roe v.

The technique is designed to realign the spine by applying pressure in key areas of the back;\u00a0 effectively decompressing the discs by applying a gentle stretch to the lower spine, and a series of repetitive movements and thrusts to reduce pressure.\u00a0The Flexion-Distraction technique is typically performed on a special table that helps to separate the thoracic, cervical and lumbar spinal joints. Only slight pressure is applied to the body throughout the process, and the goal is decrease pressure and decompress the inflamed areas around the spine to restore nerve functioning. Dr. Karl has been a Chiropractic Physician for over 20 years.\u00a0 Check out his website at www<a href=\"http:\/\/www.drkarlnixdorf.com\">.drkarlnixdorf.com<\/a>\u00a0to learn of the advances in chiropractic care.<\/p> <p><br\/>Business owners, managers, and salespeople learn about each other's business and we share referrals.\u00a0 First time attending?

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>Your first visit to the SongClub does not require Collective membership. After that first meeting - \u00a0we ask that you become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

Prior to becoming Hotel Victor it was formerly known as the Hudson Cafe. Victor was Mr. Rivara\u2019s son who he named the hotel and bar after. The hotel was built to accommodate ship workers traveling from Europe to the shipyards. The rooms were small with little amenities. During the 1920\u2019s the basement was a Speak Easy during prohibition. Called to the fact you had to speak quietly and be careful who you talked to. The archways in the basement also acted as betting windows.<\/p> <p>The Hotel Victor sign went up in 1935 with pink neon, which still stands today.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/7\/2\/600_337610802.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If you don't see us call Meg (number below)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Once-a-Month-Group-40\/events\/227996931\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Drinks at Hotel Victor Bar & Grill","id":"227996931","time":1453332600000,"updated":1453395400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1247252488000,"name":"Hoboken Once a Month Group- 40 +","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1487339,"urlname":"Hoboken-Once-a-Month-Group-40","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10601","country":"us","city":"White Plains","address_1":"39 North Broadway\/Route 22","address_2":"Barker Ave entrance","name":"White Plains Presbyterian Church","lon":-73.765091,"id":1577682,"state":"NY","lat":41.036545,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.0677146912,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1376401302000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Z8-Fitness\/events\/227982691\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Zumba Fitness with Stephen","id":"qscmngyvcbbc","time":1453332600000,"updated":1453337178000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1291872400000,"name":"Z8 Fitness, Zumba in White Plains, NY","group_lon":-73.7600021362,"id":1748416,"urlname":"Z8-Fitness","group_lat":41.0299987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Totowa","address_1":"1 Us Highway 46","name":"Holiday Inn TOTOWA WAYNE","lon":-74.222054,"id":17939832,"lat":40.891842,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.6287164688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452121524000,"fee":{"amount":30,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us this month at the NJ Real Estate Investment Club!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Topic:<\/b> Being a Private Money Lender\/Partner OR working with a Private Money Lender\/Partner<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Speaker: <\/b>Christopher J.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena. IAC is an educational and research centered organization in the area of consciousness studies, human potential and psychic development, and has offices in over 12 countries worldwide.<\/p> <p>How do I attend?<\/p> <p>Confirm via meetup that you're attending or email us to register at newyork (-at-) iacworld.org<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"59th and Lex subway is closest.

For many of us it was the first time we didn't have to explain or make excuses for our kids (which was a relief because our kids are not easy to explain). It was also the first time that we, and our children, were immediately understood and accepted. Through that group information was shared, social opportunities were created for parents and children, and lasting relationships, both personal and professional, were formed. Some of those relationships culminated in programs like a talent development mentor program for young 2e musicians and Nassau Community College's Achilles program for 2e college students. In both my personal and professional experience I have found that parents of twice exceptionally gifted kids are some of the most interesting, resourceful, innovative, brave and resilient parents I've ever met. By starting this group I hope to renew the energy among parents that Twice Exceptional Children's Advocacy generated through monthly gatherings.<\/p> <p>As a consultant, psychotherapist and parent I am happy to share my personal and professional knowledge and experience, and to offer parenting tips and strategies. I would also encourage you to share your ideas, including what has worked\/not worked with, and for your children.<\/p> <p>Let's get together and talk about...<\/p> <p>- what 2e is... and isn't<\/p> <p>- communicating with our kids<\/p> <p>- building parent\/child relationships<\/p> <p>- collaborating with schools<\/p> <p>- friendships<\/p> <p>- siblings\/family relationships<\/p> <p>- interventions &amp; therapies (medical\/alternative)<\/p> <p>- extracurricular\/enrichment (and how to create what doesn't exist<\/p> <p>- and anything 2e you'd like to talk about that I haven't listed.<\/p> <p>This meetup is for parents of 2e kids of all ages -- we all have something valuable to share.<\/p> <p>I look forward to seeing you soon!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sea-Cliff-Parents-of-Gifted-Twice-Exceptional-Kids-Meetup\/events\/227495609\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Let's get to know each other and share our 2e parenting experiences.","id":"227495609","time":1453334400000,"updated":1453347371000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1419265533000,"name":"Sea Cliff Parents of Gifted\/Twice Exceptional Kids Meetup","group_lon":-73.6399993896,"id":18268393,"urlname":"Sea-Cliff-Parents-of-Gifted-Twice-Exceptional-Kids-Meetup","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Parents of 2e Kids"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"407 8th Ave (btwn 30th & 31st St.)","name":"Tempest Bar ","lon":0,"id":23922802,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":29,"distance":0.524105012417,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450889639000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Are you game for something new this year?

A small shop selling classically prepared pastries, fine coffee and chocolate, bonbons, wines and liquors as well as Havana cigars was operated by the Delmonico brothers. Its success led them to purchase a triangular plot of land at the intersection of Beaver, William and South William Streets where, in 1837, they opened the first fine dining restaurant in the country. Delmonico's offered an unheard of luxury \u2013 the availability of private dining rooms (located on the third floor) where discriminate entertaining was the order of the day. The basement held the restauranteur's treasure, the largest private wine cellar in the city, holding an impressive 1,000 bottles of the world's finest wines. It was during these early years that Chef Alessandro Fellippini began to develop the restaurant's culinary identity with the house special, Delmonico Steak.<\/p> <p>Yelp page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/delmonicos-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/delmonicos-new-york<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/WkAngnP-LdwrgVC1swfdGA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/QkokEtZk_9FqTsWdl0UYiA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/JoZIrrrIY_9jAOwQArHjxA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/0xYyQXPRY1uqYv9B7YYelw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Reservation under the name \"Angela Chung\"","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/228034332\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Restaurant Week at Delmonico's, \"First Restaurant in America\"","id":"228034332","time":1453334400000,"updated":1453354061000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

Legal Hackers Jam Sessions are monthly small-group working sessions that are geared to address a specific problem in a quick sprint. Jam Sessions will differ from our regular panel events in two ways: (1) smaller group size (only 12 people per session to start, excluding organizers), and (2) more interactivity--bring your laptops and other small computing devices. One LH member will lead each Jam Session by posing a problem, with background, relevant to the Legal Hackers community, perhaps in connection with a personal project, perhaps soliciting support for a group project. From there, we will do our best to pose a real solution to that problem in a 3-4 hour sprint. At the end of each Jam Session, we will vote to determine if we need another Jam Session to keep things going, or if we're ready to move on.<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Important things to note: <\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Unfortunately, we will have to strictly enforce the RSVP list because space is very limited.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Jam Sessions are not replacing our regular panel events.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0As with all our events (other than hackathons), anything generated during Jam Sessions should be contributed to the group on a Creative Commons or Open Source basis.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our first Jam Session will be led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/gajbotelho\">Gabriel Botelho<\/a>, founder of Justice Pipes.

The main advantage of deep learning is that it automates the process of designing good features for a machine learning system. Yann will review the basic ideas and methods of deep learning and describe a number of large-scale practical applications in image understanding and natural language understanding. Beyond traditional ML applications, the long-term goal of deep learning is to enable progress towards AI systems. Yann\u00a0will talk about some of the challenges on the path to AI.<\/p> <p><b>Bio of speaker:<\/b><\/p> <p>Yann LeCun is Director of AI Research at Facebook, and Silver Professor of Data Science, Computer Science, Neural Science, and Electrical Engineering at New York University, affiliated with the NYU Center for Data Science, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, the Center for Neural Science, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He received the Electrical Engineer Diploma from Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs en Electrotechnique et Electronique (ESIEE), Paris in 1983, and a PhD in Computer Science from Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) in 1987. After a postdoc at the University of Toronto, he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, NJ in 1988. He became head of the Image Processing Research Department at AT&amp;T Labs-Research in 1996, and joined NYU as a professor in 2003, after a brief period as a Fellow of the NEC Research Institute in Princeton. From 2012 to 2014 he directed NYU's initiative in data science and became the founding director of the NYU Center for Data Science. He was named Director of AI Research at Facebook in late 2013 and retains a part-time position on the NYU faculty.\u00a0<\/p> <p>His current interests include AI, machine learning, computer perception, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. He has published over 180 technical papers and book chapters on these topics as well as on neural networks, handwriting recognition, image processing and compression, and on dedicated circuits and architectures for computer perception. The character recognition technology he developed at Bell Labs is used by several banks around the world to read checks and was reading between 10 and 20% of all the checks in the US in the early 2000s. His image compression technology, called DjVu, is used by hundreds of web sites and publishers and millions of users to access scanned documents on the Web. Since the mid 1980's he has been working on deep learning methods, particularly the convolutional network model, which is the basis of many products and services deployed by companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM, NEC, AT&amp;T and others for image and video understanding, document recognition, human-computer interaction, and speech recognition.\u00a0<\/p> <p>LeCun has been on the editorial board of IJCV, IEEE PAMI, and IEEE Trans. Neural Networks, was program chair of CVPR'06, and is chair of ICLR 2013 and 2014. He is on the science advisory board of Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He has advised many large and small companies about machine learning technology, including several startups he co-founded. He is the lead faculty at NYU for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment, a $36M initiative in collaboration with UC Berkeley and University of Washington to develop data-driven methods in the sciences. He is the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Data-Science-Academy\/events\/227938014\/","yes_rsvp_count":63,"duration":7200000,"name":"Learn Deep Learning with one of the most world well known scholars","id":"227938014","time":1453334400000,"updated":1453348349000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1382477840000,"name":"NYC Data Science Academy","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10802022,"urlname":"NYC-Data-Science-Academy","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Data Scientists, R Users"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brookyn ","address_1":"647 Fulton st","name":"BRIC Arts Media House ( 1st floor Ballroom)","lon":-73.979103,"id":19305092,"state":"NY","lat":40.688206,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.31643486023,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449179350000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/cENnBlBMOufwq1krfzvaVj_xSrek2Y_WlC7SR_XHKCB8b57iLDyqZYWw5TjaX6TqRVdzPwFZg1fQixqzKpTFXz9lKgIBjTSa_g_ffvgZ2kEaq9BAhaSdbNobmQrlwYhjvC4SEGq9\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/cENnBlBMOufwq1krfzvaVj_xSrek2Y_WlC7SR_XHKCB8b57iLDyqZYWw5TjaX6TqRVdzPwFZg1fQixqzKpTFXz9lKgIBjTSa_g_ffvgZ2kEaq9BAhaSdbNobmQrlwYhjvC4SEGq9<\/a><\/p> <p>Join <a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/\">Marcos Salazar<\/a>, Co-founder and Executive Director of <a href=\"http:\/\/besocialchange.org\/\">Be Social Change<\/a>, and Leslie G.

The main advantage of deep learning is that it automates the process of designing good features for a machine learning system. Yann will review the basic ideas and methods of deep learning and describe a number of large-scale practical applications in image understanding and natural language understanding. Beyond traditional ML applications, the long-term goal of deep learning is to enable progress towards AI systems. Yann\u00a0will talk about some of the challenges on the path to AI.<\/p> <p><b>Bio of speaker:<\/b><\/p> <p>Yann LeCun is Director of AI Research at Facebook, and Silver Professor of Data Science, Computer Science, Neural Science, and Electrical Engineering at New York University, affiliated with the NYU Center for Data Science, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, the Center for Neural Science, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He received the Electrical Engineer Diploma from Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs en Electrotechnique et Electronique (ESIEE), Paris in 1983, and a PhD in Computer Science from Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) in 1987. After a postdoc at the University of Toronto, he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, NJ in 1988. He became head of the Image Processing Research Department at AT&amp;T Labs-Research in 1996, and joined NYU as a professor in 2003, after a brief period as a Fellow of the NEC Research Institute in Princeton. From 2012 to 2014 he directed NYU's initiative in data science and became the founding director of the NYU Center for Data Science. He was named Director of AI Research at Facebook in late 2013 and retains a part-time position on the NYU faculty.\u00a0<\/p> <p>His current interests include AI, machine learning, computer perception, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. He has published over 180 technical papers and book chapters on these topics as well as on neural networks, handwriting recognition, image processing and compression, and on dedicated circuits and architectures for computer perception. The character recognition technology he developed at Bell Labs is used by several banks around the world to read checks and was reading between 10 and 20% of all the checks in the US in the early 2000s. His image compression technology, called DjVu, is used by hundreds of web sites and publishers and millions of users to access scanned documents on the Web. Since the mid 1980's he has been working on deep learning methods, particularly the convolutional network model, which is the basis of many products and services deployed by companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM, NEC, AT&amp;T and others for image and video understanding, document recognition, human-computer interaction, and speech recognition.\u00a0<\/p> <p>LeCun has been on the editorial board of IJCV, IEEE PAMI, and IEEE Trans. Neural Networks, was program chair of CVPR'06, and is chair of ICLR 2013 and 2014. He is on the science advisory board of Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He has advised many large and small companies about machine learning technology, including several startups he co-founded. He is the lead faculty at NYU for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment, a $36M initiative in collaboration with UC Berkeley and University of Washington to develop data-driven methods in the sciences. He is the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Open-Data\/events\/227866988\/","yes_rsvp_count":350,"duration":10800000,"name":"Learn Deep Learning with one of the most world well known scholars","id":"227866988","time":1453334400000,"updated":1453420925000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369362644000,"name":"NYC Open Data","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":8619412,"urlname":"NYC-Open-Data","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Data Scientists and Open Data-er"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York City","address_1":"East Village 85 E 4th St. (second floor)","name":"KGB","lon":-73.989951,"id":1053393,"state":"NY","lat":40.726424,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":1.63239550591,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451962786000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>FANTASTIC FICTION at KGB reading series, hosts Ellen Datlow and Matthew Kressel present:<\/p> <p>The Freedom Maze by Delia Sherman<br\/>Delia Sherman<br\/>Delia Sherman\u2019s writing habit has been the cause of numerous short stories and novels, the most recent of which is the Norton Award-winning The Freedom Maze.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Risk and its transferability was the focus and uncertainty was sidelined. After the recent financial crisis, uncertainty and its consequences have become a major concern for many prominent academics, yet practitioners are constrained by probability-based tools and regulatory mandates. Managing Uncertainty, Mitigating Risk offers a liberated perspective on uncertainty in banking and finance. The book stresses that uncertainty must be confronted by using a broader range of inputs, employing methods outside conventional probability. More often than not, systemic risks are not completely unforeseeable and a range of likely risk scenarios can be fleshed out, quantified and largely mitigated. We can accomplish this only if we widen our knowledgebase to include qualitative data and judgment. Probability and historical data alone cannot sufficiently model game-changing and catastrophic one-off situations such as Eurozone exit and breakup, US debt ceiling, and Brexit.<\/p> <p>This book presents a robust foundation and a novel and practical method for incorporating uncertainty into existing risk frameworks. It takes the reader beyond the realms of probability in modern finance, into imprecise probability \u2013 the mathematics of uncertainty. We introduce uncertain value-at-risk (UVaR), a measure which takes the VaR engine and enhances it using credal nets, an imprecise extension of Bayesian nets. Unlike the unjustified precision of probability-based models, UVaR helps to assesses uncertainty by incorporating expert insight through priors, with more extensive datasets. By combining a solid quantitative method with an implementation framework and cases, this book allows the reader to not only understand the solution for managing uncertain one-offs, but also to see the end-product. This is a starting point for risk practitioners to go beyond regulatory-initiated tools in order to employ their own approaches towards recognizing and managing uncertainty.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Speaker: <\/b>Nick Firoozye is a Managing Director at Nomura International and heads a global team in cross-product derivatives research.

The Design Thinking process is not a monolithic process that has to be brought in as massive expense, trouble and stress. It\u2019s a toolbox of skills and mindsets that we believe anyone can learn, and start to bring into their jobs in many simple ways.<\/p> <p>WHAT IS DESIGN THINKING ANYWAY?<\/p> <p>Design Thinking is a process for solving problems and developing business strategy that puts an increased emphasis on understanding internal and external stakeholders. In this process we emphasize human stories, real world observations, and a deeper level of empathy.<\/p> <p>The process we teach is not fundamentally different than any design thinking process you will find anywhere else\u2026.we\u2019ve just tried to make it simple to use. We took a look at every other process we saw being taught and consulted with and boiled down to the simplest language possible. We work hard not to overcomplicate the process \u2013 it\u2019s a tool to be adapted and molded to an individual\u2019s situation. Design Thinking serves as a valuable common language that diverse teams and groups of people can use to effectively collaborate on challenges and projects.<\/p> <p>WHAT WILL I LEARN?<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll cover the five phases of design thinking, giving you a background into the theory and practice of each. We\u2019ll move through each phase quickly and fuidly, stopping after each phase to reflect and take a breather. It\u2019s a long, hard and fun day\u2026we\u2019ll push you to absorb a lot of material, but you\u2019ll leave with a solid toolset and a great start on your journey through design thinking.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Design-Gym-New-York-City\/events\/227502075\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":32400000,"name":"Design Thinking Bootcamp","id":"227502075","time":1453384800000,"updated":1453418926000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1413907282000,"name":"The Design Gym New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":17769772,"urlname":"The-Design-Gym-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Community Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Westbury","address_1":"675 Brookside Court","name":"New Hope Church","lon":-73.568253,"id":23635171,"state":"NY","lat":40.744411,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.1245346069,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446780287000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>With the business of the holidays behind us let's discuss how to embrace the rhythms of rest in our lives and how that effects our family. \u00a0As a mom it can be hard to find the time for rest and it seems to look different in the various seasons of our life. \u00a0We hope to discuss all that and more.\u00a0Feel free to invite a friend.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"New Hope Church, Westbury 675 Brookside Court, Westbury, NY 11590","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westbury-MOPS-Moms-Next-Meetup\/events\/226582341\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Embrace the Rhythms of Rest","id":"wdcnflyvcbcc","time":1453386600000,"updated":1453394657000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1423694940000,"name":"Westbury MOPS Moms-Next Meetup","group_lon":-73.5800018311,"id":18428869,"urlname":"Westbury-MOPS-Moms-Next-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Moms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"350 West Broadway","name":"AWS Pop-Up Loft","lon":-74.003693,"id":23980941,"state":"NY","lat":40.722824,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.01408910751,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447675786000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For coworking space, it's first come first served.
