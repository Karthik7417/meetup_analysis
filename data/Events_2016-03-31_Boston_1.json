The language is designed in expectation of a sufficiently smart optimizer, knowing that such things are possible - but setting quite a challenge for those of us working on Perl 6 implementation.<\/p> <p>Following the \"make it work, then make it fast\" approach, we've done a lot of work over the years on getting many language features to work well in Rakudo. ... In this session I'll discuss how we've been improving Perl 6 performance by working at all levels of the implementation: optimizing built-ins, improving the Perl 6 optimizer's ability to simplify code, and building a powerful dynamic optimizer for MoarVM that uses runtime information about a program's typical behavior to cheapen attribute accesses, resolve dispatches, eliminate type checks, perform inlining, and much more.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

B. Rainsberger <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jbrains.ca\/\">www.jbrains.ca<\/a>]<br\/>I originally chose to learn and practice TDD because I made too many mistakes and wanted to find and fix them sooner, so I first thought of TDD as a testing technique for programmers. Later, after I got my mistakes under control, I noticed that testable code tended to be well-designed code, so I realized that TDD isn\u2019t a testing technique, but rather an evolutionary design technique. Over the years, I noticed that practicing TDD didn\u2019t just guide me towards better designs, but rather it guided me towards a better understanding of the design principles that I managed not to learn from textbooks. I stopped thinking of TDD as a design technique and began thinking of it as a really-learn-the-principles-of-good-design technique. I have taught TDD this way for over a decade and now thousands of programmers have developed their design skill as naturally as the way they learned to speak their native language.<br\/>Of course, TDD didn\u2019t change; I did. And TDD wasn\u2019t even the most important ingredient in my evolution as a programmer!<br\/>In this session, I will share a little about how and why I adopted TDD, how it has helped me, and why I continue to do it over 15 years later. After that, I want to take your questions about TDD: how, why, when\u2026 whatever!

The application is treated as a black box in which all the inputs and outputs happen through the same interface with which the end user interacts. At Localytics, our mobile team develops client libraries that our customers integrate into their applications. The primary function of our client library is to package up information the application gives us and send it to our servers. For us, black box testing with the UI as our input and output is not very useful. Instead, our input is the\u00a0application facing\u00a0API, and our output is the network. To help us test our client library we have developed a mock server that lets us capture network requests and validate that they contain the correct data. This allows us to call into our client library and validate all outputs in an isolated testing environment. In this\u00a0session\u00a0I will discuss our need for the mock server, how it works, and other testing scenarios in which it may be useful.<br\/><i>(speech level:\u00a0intermediate; duration: 20\u00a0minutes)\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Networking Session 4 - DJ Mix 4 - Food &amp; Drink \u00a0<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mobiletea\/events\/228891215\/","yes_rsvp_count":138,"duration":12600000,"name":"Mobile Tea #9 + MassTLC: Test First or Die!

Ad\u00e9s is known for his distinctively creative music, and many consider him to be one of contemporary music\u2019s most gifted composers.<\/p> <p>For the Ravel G-Major piano concerto, Jeffrey Kahane will conduct from the keyboard, as in his previous NEC conducting visits.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1639626412944839\/\">[img class=\"image image-thumbnail \" src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/necmusic.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/facebook_logo35_2.jpg\" \/>\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"35\" height=\"33\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>Program<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5011970\">Ravel: Concerto for Piano in G major<\/a><br\/>Allegramente<br\/>Adagio assai<br\/>Presto<br\/>Jeffrey Kahane (Piano)<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4jYVnNHo3S8\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4jYVnNHo3S8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4jYVnNHo3S8<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5023701\">Ad\u00e8s: Studies (3) for Chamber Orchestra from Couperin<\/a><br\/>Amusements<br\/>Sleight of Hand<br\/>The Soul in Torment<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r5IEPFQt8Cs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r5IEPFQt8Cs\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r5IEPFQt8Cs<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0pblIBYPXJg\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0pblIBYPXJg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0pblIBYPXJg<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gT6YW3P7o6g\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gT6YW3P7o6g<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5023220\">Elgar: Symphony no 1 in A flat major, Op. 55<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Andante nobilmente e semplice - Allegro<br\/>Allegro molto<br\/>Adagio<br\/>Lento - Allegro<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2OXU-TTDhHU\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2OXU-TTDhHU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2OXU-TTDhHU<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Date:\u00a0March 9, 2016 - 7:30PM<\/p> <p>Price:\u00a0Free<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0NEC's Jordan Hall<\/p> <p>NEC's FREE concerts do not require a ticket, unless stated in concert listing.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Hogan has received grants from the NEA and the Guggenheim Foundation, and her awards include a Lannan Literary Award, an American Book Award, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writers Circle of the Americas. William Kittredge, in his introduction to Hogan\u2019s Rounding the Human Corners, noted, \u201cpoets like Linda, through their language, open for us a doorway into their specific resonating dream of the electric universe.\u201d<\/p> <p>Other Linda Hogan poetry collections include: Calling Myself Home (1978); Daughters, I Love You (1981); Eclipse (1983); Seeing Through the Sun (1985), which won the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation; Savings (1988), The Book of Medicines, a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (1993); and Rounding the Human Corners (2008).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hogan\u2019s collections of prose also reflect her interests in the environment and Native American culture. Her publications in prose include: Dwellings: A Spiritual History of the Living World (1995), The Woman Who Watches Over the World: A Native Memoir (2001), and, with Brenda Peterson, Sighting: The Gray Whales\u2019 Mysterious Journey (2002). Her novels include Mean Spirit (1990), Solar Storms(1995), Power (1998), and People of the Whale: A Novel (2008). Together with Brenda Peterson, she also edited the anthology The Sweet Breathing of Plants: Women and the Green World (2001). A recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation for her fiction,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Active as an educator and speaker, Hogan taught at the University of Colorado and at the Indigenous Education Institute. She has been a speaker at the United Nations Forum and was a plenary speaker at the Environmental Literature Conference in Turkey in 2009.<\/p> <p>Hogan\u2019s awards include a Lannan Literary Award, the Mountains and Plains Booksellers Spirit of the West Literary Achievement Award, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writers Circle of the Americas.<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>The Henry David Thoreau Prize was established in 2010 by writer and naturalist Dale Peterson, and is awarded annually to a writer demonstrating literary excellence in nature writing.

From Trees to Rules in Machine Learning<\/p> <p><br\/>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Machine learning (aka pattern recognition)(aka predictive modeling) has a long history with tree\u2013based models, such as CART or random forests. However, a parallel set of methodologies have been developed that use rules to create effective predictions (e.g. Quinlan (1992) and Quinlan (1993)). Many of these models are not well known and have not undergone significant peer review but are nonetheless very powerful. Recent developments are bringing a revival of these models. This talk will discuss rule\u2013based models using a port of the Cubist (and C5.0) code to R.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-useR\/events\/228513379\/","yes_rsvp_count":150,"name":"Rule, Rules, Rules!

How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/229000371\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":6300000,"name":"Friday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"mvjjglyvfbpb","time":1457716500000,"updated":1457724373000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":10.1041755676,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457532444000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>All Are Invited: Lunchtime Meet Up at Rebecca's Caf\u00e9!<br\/>\u00a0SPC members have long expressed an interest in an additional channel for unstructured networking and just plain schmoozing about their business triumphs and trials.<br\/>Here's how it works: You just show up!

The idea of a love for the night sky brings to mind a poem by Sarah Williams: \"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night\". Please attend this \"Introduction To The Night Sky\" event bringing only a curiosity to know more about what you're seeing when you look up on a clear night in your back yard. If you have binoculars or even a telescope, you'll be able to see many many more interesting treasures of the night sky, so please bring them. This month we're going to have a \"Deep Sky Treasure Hunt\" The idea is to go out into the night looking for the following \"Treasures\"<br\/>A \"First Magnitude\" star<br\/>An \"Open Star Cluster\"<br\/>A \"Globular Star Cluster\"<br\/>A \"Double Cluster\" of Stars<br\/>A \"Galaxy\"<br\/>Your favorite winter \"Constellation\"<br\/>A \"King Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Queen Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Heroic Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Dragon Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Daughter of The King &amp; Queen Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Bear Constellation\"<br\/>The \"Seven Sisters\" Constellation<br\/>A \"Swan Constellation\"<br\/>A \"Double Star\"<br\/>A \"Blue Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"Red Colored Star\"<br\/>An \"Orange Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"White Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"Pinkish Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"Yellowish Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"Greenish Colored Star\"<br\/>A \"Stellar Nursery\" (Where stars are in the process of being born)<br\/>An \"Emission Nebula\"<br\/>Please know that you are welcome as long as you plan to participate in these discoveries as a group.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 9 am. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 30 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

To fully understand why we are hosting this charity, you must first understand her story:<\/p> <p>\n\nFrom her sister, Sofia Hart:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"Olivia always thrived to do the best she could. Being gifted with horse back riding as our hobby (or life passion) growing up, she was incredibly fearless and passionate with everything in her. She was also happy to be a Vineyarder during her years playing Hockey and Soccer, representing the place she loved most, home. Her determination was unstoppable on and off horse back, the field, and the ice. These characteristics followed her through her life growing into adulthood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nAs a recent University of Vermont graduate, she did just the same in her studies. When she felt defeated, she would do everything in her power to figure out what went wrong, and how she could fix her mistakes. While at her graduation, tears of joy were brought to my eyes as she smiled receiving her achievements and laughed and hugged with friends. Not only was she proud of herself, but she was even more proud of the people who surrounded her and their accomplishments too.<\/p> <p>\n\nThese qualities and characteristics went even further into the workplace. As a former employee of the Homeport Resturant, she used the skills and experience she learned there and carried it to the Seafood Shanty. Each and every job she has held has meant so much to her. Good days and bad days, she always would talk so highly of her job, especially for how dedicated she was to each establishment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThrough hardwork, fearlessness, dedication and most importantly, love, Olivia has gained a rather admirable reputation growing up on Martha's Vineyard for 22 years, and at UVM during her college years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThese amazing qualities and characteristics have not diminished one bit during these tough times. Her spirit is incredibly high, and she shocks us on a daily basis how positive her attitude is. I can not imagine being in her place, and handling the news she gets on a daily basis. Although she has received bad news many times, her positive outlook has not changed. Olivia is determined as ever, looking toward the brightest future.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nHere is more on Olivias condition, with a post from her Facebook page:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"So here it is. On the 9th I was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and diagnosed with a condition known as cardiomyopathy which is a disease of the heart muscle. There is damage to both the right and left portions but the majority of the damage is in the left ventricle. It wasn't until I had a cardiac MRI that the doctors realized my condition was most likely irreversible. The doctors believe it either began years ago when I most likely contracted a viral infection that attacked my heart or may have been something I was born with... the overall cause is unknown. My age enabled me to live and thrive with the condition until a couple of months ago. Currently, I am in the process of being placed on the heart transplant list, which I will hopefully be accepted to by the end of the week, and will receive a new heart by the start of the new year. For now that is about all that we know.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Important Information:<\/p> <p>\n\nWhen - October 31st, 11:00am<\/p> <p>\n\nWhat to bring - This will be a costume workout, so please wear an AWESOME halloween costume.

Here lies a dazzling world of calving glaciers, rushing waterfalls, and towering peaks rising from blue green seas, and remote, mist-shrouded islands. By boat, foot, and vehicle, we explore the hidden corners of Chiloe Island, home to a fiercely independent, sea-faring people. The island boasts a unique flavor from the mainland\u2013 from its renowned food to its stilted wooden architecture. Wet and windswept, with lush hills and an early morning fog that cloaks, perhaps it is no wonder that the people here have a distinctive spiritual mythology of witchcraft, ghost ships, and forest gnomes.

Soon after, the eldest, recently returned from America, hails a taxi to the local mosque. The second, a doctor, goes to check in at his hospital. His troubled wife does not join the family that morning. No one knows where Mina goes these days. And the youngest, the idealist, leaves for town on a motorbike. Seated behind him is a beautiful, fragile girl whose life and thoughts are overwhelmed by the war that has enveloped the place of her birth.<br\/>Three hours later their day will end in devastating circumstances.<br\/>The Shadow of the Crescent Moon chronicles the lives of five young people trying to live and love in a world on fire. Individuals are pushed to make terrible choices. And, as the events of this single morning unfold, one woman is at the center of it all.<br\/>'A first novel of uncommon poise and acuity, The Shadow of the Crescent Moon is set in an old and protracted war for land and dignity. But its swift and suspenseful narrative describes a fiercely contemporary battle in the human heart: between the seductive fantasy of personal freedom and the tenacious claims of family, community and history.' Pankaj Mishra<br\/>Fatima Bhutto was born in Kabul, grew up in Damascus, and lives in Karachi.

Still life compositions represent our thoughts on mortality, the passage of time, our organic nature, or connections to ourselves, family, and the world around us. A still life is actually rather \u201cunstill\u201d in that its subject is often constantly changing.<\/p> <p>Still life is deeply rooted in art historical tradition, and has always been heavily symbolic, with meanings attached to the fruits, vegetables, flowers, and other objects of desire meticulously arranged and carefully rendered. Contemporary interpretations look to the art of the Baroque\u2014Italian, Spanish, and Dutch works marked by voluminous and detailed compositions with dramatic lighting and a rich palette. The trompe l\u2019oeil aspect of a still life, seen often in nineteenth-century American art, was particularly captivating to viewers, fooling the eye into believing that there was a third dimension to an otherwise traditional two-dimensional composition. Realism that looks good enough to touch is well represented in the Museum\u2019s permanent collection, in works by Audrey Flack, Phyllis Berman, Denise Mickilowski, and Scott Prior. The \u201cunstill life\u201d\u2014seen in works by Hyman Bloom, Karl Zerbe, Aaron Fink, and Nina Bohlen\u2014engages expressive forms nearing abstraction, and serve as a fitting counterpoint to photo-realism.<\/p> <p>Beautiful Decay includes two galleries of works from the Museum\u2019s permanent collection, accompanied by installations from three contemporary artists, Sarah Meyers Brent, Steven Duede, and David Weinberg. Through paintings, drawings, photographs, and mixed media installation, the exhibition invites viewers to expand their definition to explore both the traditional and untraditional still life.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the lobby","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonArtEnthusiasts\/events\/229467622\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"New Exhibit at the Danforth Museum & Discussion","id":"229467622","time":1457809200000,"updated":1457821191000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221166586000,"name":"Boston Art Enthusiasts","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1280431,"urlname":"BostonArtEnthusiasts","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Art Exhibit Exthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Malden","address_1":"Location will be printed on ticket","name":"Boston","lon":-71.066162,"id":24421891,"state":"MA","lat":42.425095,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.51107215881,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457726560000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us this year and make you own pint glass to enjoy your St. Patrick's Day brew.

Join us as we explore the charming, historic, area of Boston known as Beacon Hill. We will focus on photographing the architectural details of this area packed with Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian architectural treasures, antique shops and historic landmarks. This makes great practice for any traveling you may do where you want to capture the spirit of a place. What makes it unique?\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/8\/e\/600_441678574.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Three skills you will practice to help you take better pictures:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0See: What is your creative vision.

Understand the fundamental camera settings necessary to realize your vision and make sure your photos are in clear focus and properly exposed. This will be a good time to practice going off the Auto setting \u00a0with my guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Be: Be present and connected to your surroundings so you can create photos from your personal experience. This makes the difference between a snapshot and a photograph.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/a\/4\/600_441678596.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come discover the architectural details of Beacon Hill in Boston hidden in plain sight. You can make the ordinary extraordinary through your photography.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will visit the most exclusive neighborhood on the hill, Louisburg Square, and the African Meeting House, an important underground railroad destination for runaway slaves.<\/p> <p><br\/>Learning to see creatively means slowing down to notice simple details right in front of you that have the potential to make a great photo. The things other people walk right by will suddenly jump out at you begging for your attention.<\/p> <p>First, we will meet in front of Peets Cafe and I will introduce you to some simple step by step practices for creative seeing so you can find beauty in the most unexpected places.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/b\/c\/600_441678620.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I have designed a series of \u00a030 minute practices we will do together that will improve your composition, depth of field, and basic camera settings. Then you will have some time on your own to wander.<\/p> <p><br\/>You will have a chance to try these out right away with my guidance. \u00a0You will receive individual coaching and critique while we are on the streets shooting. This way you can be confident that you will be able to repeat the process next time you are out on a shoot.

As always, this is a non technical jargon zone. It is all about the creative act of seeing and capturing the moments of life with a fresh eye.<\/p> <p><br\/>I have found a fantastic area on Beacon Hill for our shoot. The winding streets are packed with interesting colors, reflections, architectural details, pipes, door knockers, all kinds of things you would never imagine would make great photo.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/f\/6\/600_441678678.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo By former class participant Monica.

Karamakate, a mystic Amazonian shaman and the last survivor of his people, serves as guide to an ailing German ethnographic explorer in 1909, and again thirty years later to an American who follows, both searching for the sacred healing plant, the Yakruna. Filled with regret and loneliness over the loss of his people and unable to fully trust the white men he agrees to guide, Karamakate ultimately proves an invaluable resource to the explorers, both of whom are curious to learn about his lost culture.

They have traced the location of a mysterious doll to the Greenwich Village apartment of Sam Hendrix and his blind wife, Susy. Sam had apparently been persuaded by a strange woman to transport the doll across the Canadian border, not knowing that sewn inside were several grams of heroin. When the woman is murdered, the situation becomes more urgent. The sinister men try to trick Susy into handing over the doll, but she refuses to reveal its location, and when she figures out she is the victim of a bizarre charade, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. So when darkness falls, she turns off all the lights, leaving everyone to maneuver in the dark until the game ends.<\/p> <p>Ticket Prices<\/p> <p>$ 20.00 General Admission<br\/>$ 18.00 Seniors &amp; Students<br\/>Tickets on Line:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brownpapertickets.com\/event\/2464968\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.brownpapertickets.com\/event\/2464968<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plymouthcommunitytheatre.net\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.plymouthcommunitytheatre.net<\/a> Get your tickets online before RSVP'ing.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Plymouth-Creative-and-Performing-Arts\/events\/228845498\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Plymouth Community Theatre's Wait Until Dark","id":"228845498","time":1457829000000,"updated":1457841568000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1447020386000,"name":"Plymouth Creative and Performing Arts","group_lon":-70.6399993896,"id":19102748,"urlname":"Plymouth-Creative-and-Performing-Arts","group_lat":41.8699989319,"who":"Perfomers, Artists & aficionados"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861012935638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457553481000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for AYCE Hotpot &amp; Sushi and Sashimi. \u00a0Bubble tea after dinner is an option<\/p> <p>\n\nAgain, please RSVP only if you can make.

Although the numbers of self-proclaimed humanists has always been relatively small, this talk will show how they were able to change American society in profound ways.<\/p> <p>Given how the contemporary atheist movement has been bitterly divided about the role that social justice should play among the non-religious, it\u2019s worth remembering that freethinking traditionally has had a very strong ethical component that involved questioning the status quo and the hierarchies associated with it.

We will open up the event for anyone who would like to share their spiritual experiences which could be anything from Meditation, Yoga, Buddhism, Energy Healing, Vegetarianism, Religion, God, etc. For newcomers to meditation, this will be an ideal way for you to learn about calming the mind and spiritual growth practices. Please note that the only cost for this event will be for your lunch which you pay to the restaurant. Otherwise, there are no additional costs.

Still, even nonreligious people can experience great pressure to follow the path that seems expected of us-- by our parents, our peers, or ourselves.<\/p> <p>Certainly we are right to expect one another to live up to the standard of basic ethical decency. And it may be a good thing to encourage one another to take standards for ethical living even beyond the basics-- maybe it's fine if there's a little peer pressure show compassion to others, to do what we can to protect the environment, or to help promote racial, gen<\/p> <p>der, or other forms of social justice. But even within that framework, life offers more possibilities than we often realize. We can fail in a big way, then succeed later. We can completely change our careers, or our personal lives, or both. We can overcome aspects of our personalities that don't work for us, and we can learn to accept parts of ourselves that we never could before. In short: we can evolve as human beings, sometimes dramatically.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Back in December, Greg Epstein devoted his monthly talk at The Humanist Hub to curating a session where Hub members and friends shared their own dramatic personal stories of \"Courage in Dark Times.\" This month, he'll once again lead a session, inspired by The Moth and other storytelling traditions, where some of the people whose life journeys (thus far) have inspired him share their own stories. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to have a second act in life (or a third, or fourth, or more!) join us for this session exploring what it is like for secular people to envision ourselves, at times, as a phoenix rising from ashes.<\/p> <p>Join Humanist Chaplain Greg Epstein for his monthly talk: with music, food, discussion circles, and more.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarvardHumanist\/events\/228730765\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Greg Epstein: The Phoenix as a Humanist Symbol","id":"228730765","time":1457890200000,"updated":1457915266000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282061808000,"name":"The Humanist Hub in Harvard Square","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1692353,"urlname":"HarvardHumanist","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457445320000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Everyone-<\/p> <p>If you are not a regular there is a waiting list for this group and therefore coming this week is not an option.

If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being.

This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

Even as he moves through a desire-laden landscape of mansions, resorts, beaches and clubs, Rick grapples over complicated relationships with his brother (Wes Bentley) and father (Brian Dennehy). His quest to break the spell of his disenchantment takes him on a series of adventures with six alluring women: rebellious Della (Imogen Poots); his physician ex-wife, Nancy (Cate Blanchett); a serene model Helen (Freida Pinto); a woman he wronged in the past Elizabeth (Natalie Portman); a spirited, playful stripper Karen (Teresa Palmer); and an innocent Isabel (Isabel Lucas), who helps him see a way forward. Rick moves in a daze through a strange and overwhelming dreamscape -- but can he wake up to the beauty, humanity and rhythms of life around him? The deeper he searches, the more the journey becomes his destination. The 7th film from director Terrence Malick (The Thin Red Line, Tree of Life), Knight of Cups (the title refers to the Tarot card depicting a romantic adventurer guided by his emotions) offers both a vision of modern life and an intensely personal experience of memory, family, and love. Knight of Cups is produced by Nicolas Gonda, Sarah Green and Ken Kao.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

These challenges can stem from your step-child's difficulty in accepting you as their parent's partner, or ambiguity about your step-parent role (step-parents can feel like a hybrid of a parent and babysitter). Other difficulties stem from an absence of the shared history and bond, developmental challenges for your step-child or simply personality differences.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class.

Brewed with a new German malt variety called \"Red X\" and dry hopped with Mosaic, Cascade, and Amarillo- this beer is incredibly citrus-forward, rounded out with biscuit and toffee notes.<\/p> <p>The Defender<\/p> <p>India Pale Ale (IPA) - 6.7%<\/p> <p>THE DEFENDER is constantly vigilant, standing guard over all those who dare to create, to dream, and to drink great beer. This bright, juicy, West Coast-style IPA takes on a reddish twist from a dash of roasted malt. Bold, fruity hop bitterness and an intensely resinous nose lead the way into a dry finish that blazes the trail for your next sip.

The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 75 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find.<\/p> <p>Bitter Oats<\/p> <p>American Double IPA - 10.5%<\/p> <p>2016 OneHitter Series. This big boozy blonde was brewed with a boatload of oats, giving it a creamy, sweet mouthfeel with a hoppy blast.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/228950115\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvfbsb","time":1457998200000,"updated":1458013231000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454468062000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tema di discussione: <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Immigrazione verso l'Europa.

Otherwise, chairs and floor seats are provided. The term mindfulness has become part of our everyday language, we talk about \"eating mindfully\", or \"trying to be more mindful in our consumer choices.\" Furthermore, the actual method of Mindfulness is taught in prisons and schools to reduce stress, it is taught by cognitive therapists to modify dysfunctional patterns of behavior, and it is practiced by corporate CEOs to enhance effectiveness in the workplace. In other words, we have co-opted mindfulness. We have extracted it from its original context and striped it of soteriological meaning. Worse, it has been turned into an elixir to promote the smooth functioning of our most destructive institutions. The word mindfulness comes from the Pali term sati and it is part of the eightfold path which the Buddha prescribed to end Dhaka, the stressful and disturbing mental constructions through which we view ourselves and others. Mindfulness, in this context, is the basis for insight into the true nature of reality, and according to the Buddhist tradition, when we \"wake up\" to the true nature of things, we realize that we are not in as bad shape as we thought. It's likened to waking up from a bad dream. Buddha is said to have become awakened through practicing mindfulness of the breath. In our weekly meetings we will practice basic mindfulness meditation and we will seek to understand how this practice fits within the framework of the Buddha's teachings. Each meeting will last about an hour and consist of brief meditation exercises and some discussion of the Buddha's radical approach to life.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center\/events\/229451158\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"Meditate and discuss the Buddha's teachings","id":"jxtnqlyvfbsb","time":1458000000000,"updated":1458005436000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444180575000,"name":"Building Community @ Common Street Spiritual Center","group_lon":-71.3499984741,"id":19003287,"urlname":"Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Community Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brighton","address_1":"1960 Beacon St","name":"Cityside Bar","lon":-71.150505,"id":24001923,"lat":42.336353,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.43284273148,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456955250000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>EVERY Monday Comic InSite presents \u2018The Comedy Cage\u2019 at CitySide Comedy Club.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/229275455\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":6300000,"name":"Tuesday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"nknsdlyvfbtb","time":1458058500000,"updated":1458065700000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chestnut Hill","address_1":"220 Boylston St","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-71.176735,"id":22910602,"lat":42.319912,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":6.12685966492,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413592395000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>advanced players only are welcome to join us for mah jongg.

Hardware designers who've witnessed successful Agile software teams in action are asking \"Can we get some of that?\" What they don't realize is that fundamental keys to agility came directly from hardware work!<\/p> <p>Nancy began her Agile practices in development work on hardware-software products, after 15+ years as an electronics-designer-turned-software-engineer. Other teams around the world have started to apply Agile and Lean concepts in their hardware development work.<\/p> <p>This presentation will give examples of Agile hardware development from several industries, including safety-critical applications. They are not merely transplanting Agile software practices; these hardware engineers starting from the core concepts of Agile and Lean to build practices appropriate to the special constraints of hardware.<\/p> <p>With the coming explosion of IoT-related products, it will be vital for hardware and software teams to work together smoothly in a genuinely Agile way.<\/p> <p><b>About the Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p>As an electronics designer doing a bit of software development for flight simulators, Nancy Van Schooenderwoert learned about \"Design for Testability\", standard interfaces, on-chip debugging resources, spiral product lifecycle, \"Hardware - Software co-design\" and so on. Moving to full time software development and team lead work, she had a team working in iterations, using \"test first\" development, team-based estimates, - essentially most of the practices that became XP - a couple years before the first Agile books were out.<\/p> <p>As an independent Agile coach, Nancy has worked with software and hardware teams, as well as teams doing other non-software work such as research, sensor development, and operations. She has led Agile change initiatives beyond software development in safety-critical, highly regulated industries, and teaches modern Agile approaches like Mob Programming, Agile Hardware, and Lean development methods.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Building S.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229058287\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"New Members Night in Medford","id":"229058287","time":1458079200000,"updated":1458091604000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Arlington (02474)","address_1":"27 Maple Street","name":"Arlington Senior Center Mural Room","lon":-71.156799,"id":24248486,"state":"MA","lat":42.415127,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.85411167145,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449630655000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>EAT TO THRIVE<\/b>:<br\/><b>10-week course to Life Long Healthy Habits Healthy Living<\/b><br\/>with Betsy Bragg<\/p> <p>* Tuesdays, January 26 -March 29 \u00a06:00 \u2013 9:30 pm<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Come be motivated to change your life!!<\/p> <p><b>Where<\/b>: \u00a0<br\/>Arlington Senior Center Mural Room<br\/>27 Maple Street, Arlington MA<\/p> <p>Upcoming course information \u2013 apply today \u2013 space is limited<br\/>(online\/phone[masked]) \u00a0http:\/\/<a href=\"http:\/\/www.optimumhealthsolution.org\/\">www.optimumhealthsolution.org<\/a><\/p> <p><b>When:<\/b> \u00a0Tuesdays: \u00a0January 26 - March 29,\u00a0 2016<\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b>:\u00a0<br\/>Arlington Senior Center Mural Room<br\/>27 Maple Street, Arlington MA<\/p> <p>\u00a0 <b>Early Bird Special: Save $50 if registered by December 29<\/b><\/p> <p>Fee includes 383-page manual, sprouting kits, DVDs to watch,<br\/>and a five-course health-promoting meal each week.<\/p> <p><b>Eat to Thrive<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Class Dates<\/b>:\u00a0 Tuesdays, January 26 \u2013 March 29, 2016, 6:00 \u2013 9:30 pm<\/p> <p><b>Info Session<\/b>:\u00a0 Tuesday, January 5, 2016, 6:30 \u2013 8:30 pm<\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b>:\u00a0<br\/>Arlington Senior Center Mural Room<br\/>27 Maple Street, Arlington MA<\/p> <p><b>EAT TO THRIVE COURSE OPTIONS\/TRACKS AND PRICING<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0<b>AUDIT<\/b>: This is for students whose goal it is to gain exposure to the subject matter.

In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop.

We believe that important racial justice work can be done in mixed race spaces. With that being said, it can also be important to have racial affinity time as well. Sometimes you might be the only person of color in the room when people are talking about an incident in the news\/media pertaining to someone of your racial background; all eyes turn to you as if you are the spokesperson. Or maybe you identify as white and have a question you might want to ask but don\u2019t know if it will be perceived as \u2018racist\u2019 in a mixed space so you hold off. We want to grow as a group and in doing so, sometimes it is good to break up into groups and talk about how we can work towards shared liberation using our personal strengths, privilege, and experience.<\/p> <p>Racial affinity groups give an opportunity to share knowledge and experience with people who may feel similar. It is also a way to celebrate the differences among our racial groups. One of the purposes of doing this within Knapsack is for people with some shared experience to have the opportunity to collectively reflect on those realities.<\/p> <p>We will meet as a large group and do an activity before splitting into racial affinity groups to do another activity separately. We will follow this up and come together in the end for closing reflections.

There\u2019s only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that\u2019s her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn\u2019s company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June\u2019s world is turned upside down. But Finn\u2019s death brings a surprise acquaintance into June\u2019s life - someone who will help her to heal and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.<\/p> <p><br\/>At Finn\u2019s funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn\u2019s apartment and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet.

(You do not need to have read the book to participate.) Every designer has had to justify designs to non-designers, yet most lack the ability to explain themselves in a way that is compelling and fosters agreement. The ability to effectively articulate design decisions is critical to the success of a project, because the most articulate person often wins. This practical talk will include principles, tactics, and actionable methods for talking about designs with executives, developers, or other stakeholders who have influence over the project with the goal of winning them over and creating the best user experience.<\/p> <p>Tom helps companies and organizations design better websites and apps.

If those words are confusing to you now, no worries! You're exactly who we want to teach.<\/p> <p>In this class, we will be covering:\u00a0basic development\u00a0concepts, writing our own JavaScript functions,browser events, web animation,\u00a0and we will touch on\u00a0the jQuery library.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Hopefully, by this point in the year, you are just looking forward to an enjoyable Anime Boston filled with lovely weather. Hope springs eternal, right?<\/p> <p>This month, we are going to be doing something a bit more intense. Internet culture has led to all sorts of advanced yet twisted ideas in today\u2019s society. Therefore this month the titles we will be discussing deal with some examples of the absolute worst that has come out of said culture. I am talking, of course, about internet games and personalities!<\/p> <p><b>Doubt, Vol. 1 by Yoshiki Tonogai<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Rabbit Doubt-a mobile phone game-has taken Japan by storm. In it, players are rabbits who must uncover the wolf in rabbit's clothing before falling prey to its mistrust-sowing wiles...as well as its teeth. When a group of teen players decides to meet offline for fun, the last thing they expect is to lose consciousness and wake up trapped in an abandoned building, mysterious bar codes tattooed on their bodies, and a corpse strung up in front of them. To stay alive and find a way out, they have but one option-to sniff out the lying wolf in their midst. Will these virtual acquaintances be able to pull it together in the real world and figure out what's going on in time to avoid ending up as the wolf's dinner? <\/i><\/p> <p><b>Prophecy, Part 1 by Tetsuya Tsutsui <\/b><\/p> <p><i>A newspaper-masked vigilante who broadcasts his acts of vengeance before committing them. A newly-formed police division tackling the new frontier of internet-based crime. As the sun rises on the Era of Information, can a group of people who found themselves at the bottom of the food chain rattle society through the web and avenge a fallen friend? <\/i><\/p> <p>A limited number of copies are at the venue, and don\u2019t forget our special deal! On the night of the Manga Club, all participants get ten percent off all graphic novels in the store, and twenty five percent off any future Manga Club title releases in stock!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.
