For those who do not RSVP and just show up must wait until 5:30pm and depending upon the order you showed up in and if the conditions mentioned above are not met, you will be allowed to play to make it so the teams are 13 each. If you have RSVP-ed and do not show up by the time we kick off and teams are full, you will be put aside. \u00a0for those who show up late, I will set some cones aside so you can play a smaller game against anyone else who shows up late.\u00a0If you don't show up at all and RSVP-ed \"yes\", you will be warned 3 times and after that every time I see your name on RSVP you will be put as a \"no\".

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these problems and more!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Git\u00a0is a popular version control application that can track your code changes, as well as help you to be more methodical in your programming. Win win! This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your changes to a project, and using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/\">GitHub<\/a>\u00a0(a hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.<\/p> <p>We will start the class by setting up your GitHub account and configuring git on your machine. We will then go through a lecture followed by exercises to help you become a git pro!\u00a0<\/p> <p>The lecture will cover:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the basic concepts of version control<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the differences between git and other version control applications<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0fundamental git commands to track changes to a small project<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the basics of collaborating on code with other developers in a professional environment<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how to use GitHub\u00a0<\/p> <p>Want to try git for yourself?

If you have another text editor (Atom, Brackets, etc), feel free to use that instead. Problems installing Sublime? Don't worry about it, we'll help you at the beginning of the workshop.<\/p> <p>This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class. <b>You should bring your own computer to class and have administrative privileges for installing software.<\/b> Also, don't forget to bring your power supply.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Note: The $30 workshop fee covers both evenings.<\/p> <p><b>About Your Instructor Mae Capozzi:<\/b><br\/>After graduating with an English major, Mae decided to learn to code.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena. IAC is an educational and research centered organization in the area of consciousness studies, human potential and psychic development, and has offices in over 12 countries worldwide.<\/p> <p>How do I attend?<\/p> <p>Confirm via meetup that you're attending or email us to register at newyork (-at-) iacworld.org<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"59th and Lex subway is closest.

Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20. Please be timely, because we do not open our doors once we begin our meditation (for obvious reasons :).

Have you briefly experimented but find yourself surprised by the results?<\/p> <p><br\/>Flexbox, or Flexible Box Model, is a set of CSS3 properties for creating a flexible layout. By allowing a set of elements to behave predictably when accommodating various screen sizes and devices, Flexbox solves many of the layout issues developers have been struggling with for years! The days of hacks like floats and positioning are numbered as Flexbox allows us to achieve layouts simply and with cleaner code. With support in all modern browsers \/ IE10+ and just a few tools and strategies for older browsers, it is possible to start using Flexbox today.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will cover:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Flexbox syntax and how it requires us to think about layout in new ways\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 Flexbox properties and how they work\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 How Flexbox distributes space and and behaves for flexibility in layouts\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 How to decide if it makes sense to use Flexbox in your current project<\/p> <p>Tech requirements:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 A laptop (Note: a netbook or tablet is NOT a substitute!)

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

As we move into Spring, it is a vulnerable time for a resurgence in seasonal illness, especially those pathologies due to Cold and Wind.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this meetup Dr. Stephen Cowan and Moshe Heller will discuss the management of Lung disorders from an integrative approach, combining the best of eastern and western medicine. We will first start with demystifying the western approach and then look at how to combine both east and west to the benefit of the patient. We will talk about the concept of \u201cpreparing the patient to be sick\u201d rather than trying to avoid being sick as well as how to support the immune system to promote recovery. \u00a0We will illustrate these concepts with a case study.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><br\/>Moshe Heller, L.

He has a subspecialty in Developmental Pediatrics and has developed a unique holistic approach to evaluating and treating children struggling with chronic physical, emotional and cognitive disorders. \u00a0Considering the child as a reflection of the inter-related forces of family and environment is the central focus of his practice. This approach respects the inseparability of mind, body and spirit and promotes a deeper understanding of what it means to be healthy.

We even think anger will help us \u2018win\u2019 our battles, and we rely on it as if it were our trusted friend. The mind of anger, however, leaves a trail of broken relationships, lost opportunities, and painful feelings in its wake.

It is not enough to simple KNOW anger is a negative force in our lives, we need to see it for ourselves. It is only when we understand the dangers of anger that we actually develop the internal power to oppose and reduce its effects. In this series, we will learn to meditate on anger and patience, discovering how to transform a disturbed, turbulent mind into a peaceful attitude that will enable us to solve our conflicts and leave us feeling peaceful and focused.<\/p> <p>The classes will include instruction, guided meditations and discussion.<\/p> <p>The mind-training methods taught in this course include meditation and meditation break exercises; these are tried-and-tested methods which can be practiced by anyone\u2013regardless of prior experience.<br\/>Give yourself and your loved ones the gift of a patient mind!<\/p> <p>$15 suggested donation.

That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p. \u00a0<\/p> <p>COST TO ATTEND IS $10.<\/p> <p>For questions contact [masked] |[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>Can't make this one? \u00a0Visit us at www.turnonny.us<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8OWkv9zms4E\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8OWkv9zms4E<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OneTasteNewYork\/events\/229369904\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"duration":5400000,"name":"TurnON New York City","id":"kdlwjlyvfbvb","time":1458172800000,"updated":1458180041000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1251498220000,"name":"OneTaste New York","group_lon":-74,"id":1514451,"urlname":"OneTasteNewYork","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14227032661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456904817000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WORD The Story Telling Show is a night of Hilarious \"True Stories and Music at The Sidewalk Bar and Restaurant (94 Ave A) Wed Jan 20th at 8PM.

A common theme Otake uses in her works are butterflies and flowers. Butterflies here means \u201cPsyche\u201d from the Greek, life in the sense of \u201cbreath\u201d, \u201cspirit\u201d, and \u201csoul\u201d and ultimately \u201cego\u201d in the sense of conscious personality. She paints butterflies in her works representing these symbols: soul, mind, \u201cNumen\u201d(the power of God), but also beauty, shimmer, and spiritual renaissance.<\/p> <p>Japanese Painting (Nihonga) is a term created during the Meiji Period to differentiate traditional Japanese painting from Western-style paintings. Using expensive minerals and metallic pigments, traditional painters chose bold images in nature and frequently referred to Japanese court literature and poetry.<br\/>Today, the term Nihonga refers not to a particular style alone, but it is used in a broader sense to refer to various types of paintings with Indian ink or mineral pigments mixed with animal glue on a support such as silk or Japanese paper.<\/p> <p>Otake\u2019s canvas is not only paper or folding screens. She painted cherry blossoms and butterflies in the guest room in Park Hotel in Tokyo. Her beautiful motifs express infinite passage in time, and uncertainty and fact that we remain the same while the world around us changes incessantly.<\/p> <p>Hiroko Otake was born in Japan and is currently working on her new pieces in New York given a grant by Agency for Cultural Affairs Government of Japan.<br\/>She graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts with a BA in :Japanese Painting, and later received her PhD in Fine Art. She has been exhibiting her art extensively in various places such as Megumi Ogita Gallery in Tokyo Japan, Seibu Ikebukuro Art Gallery in Tokyo, Japan, IAM Gallery New York, USA, and AMBIT Gallery Barcelona, Spain.

Also, there is no fee to join this meetup group.

It is not enough to simple KNOW anger is a negative force in our lives, we need to see it for ourselves. It is only when we understand the dangers of anger that we actually develop the internal power to oppose and reduce its effects.

Concept learning provides an illustrative window into the human-machine intelligence gap: People can learn a new concept from just one or a few examples, while the best learning algorithms require many more examples to reach the same level of performance. People also use their concepts in richer ways than conventional machine learning systems -- for imagination, extrapolation, and explanation -- not just for classification. I will discuss my work on program induction as a cognitive model and potential solution for extracting richer concepts from less data, with applications to learning handwritten characters and learning recursive programs from examples.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Speaker Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Brenden Lake (<a href=\"http:\/\/cims.nyu.edu\/~brenden\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cims.nyu.edu\/~brenden\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cims.nyu.edu\/~brenden\/<\/a><\/a>) is a cognitive scientist and Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at New York University.

The artist finds inspiration in the Hindu and Buddhist philosophies that stress our interconnectedness to other beings on this planet. In a language that is definably culturally ambiguous, she stitches together elements from contemporary and ancient fables from around the world, using man\u2019s relationship with animals as a platform to examine human morality.<\/p> <p><br\/>Through a Window features paintings and drawings rich with grotesque and surreal imagery that marry the freakish, the funny, and the beautiful. The artist uses found objects, decorative materials and calligraphic drawing to arrive at figural abstractions. Sahana creates a visual experience that portrays the drama and power struggles that arise when the boundaries between human and animal bodies are deconstructed.<\/p> <p><br\/>Titled after anthropologist and ethologist Jane Goodall\u2019s dramatic saga of chimpanzee life in the Gombe, Through a Window explores issues of human morality through the lense of the relationships we have with animals. The artist uses escapism to invite the viewer to reflect on the depth and nature of how we use animals in our contemporary mythology as extensions of ourselves.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sahana Ramakrishnan was born in 1993 in Mumbai, India. She spent her childhood and early life in Singapore and travelled frequently within South East Asia, Europe, and Australia. She moved to the United States in 2011, and received her BFA in Painting from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2015. Sahana currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Her work has been exhibited in New York galleries such as at A.I.R. Gallery, The Doping Agency, and Front Art Space.<\/p> <p>Even though it has been a while since our last meetup, we hope you still want to hang out with us :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/contemporary-art-practice-nyc\/events\/229569705\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Gallery Opening - Through a Window: Sahana Ramakrishnan at Rabbithole Projects","id":"229569705","time":1458257400000,"updated":1458307210000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398190796000,"name":"The Espejo Organization for the Arts","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":14048532,"urlname":"contemporary-art-practice-nyc","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Creators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":4,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457273588000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Lets celebrate St. Patrick's day with dinner and drinks at Austin Public.

In contrast to leading conceptual art practices of the 1970s, Clemente refocused attention on representation, narrative, and the figure, and explored traditional, artisanal materials and modes of working. Since his first trip to India in the 1970s, Francesco Clemente immersed himself in the country\u2019s rich cultures as well as the everyday life and artistic practices of local people. Transforming ancient symbols, myths, and ideas, he has created a personal visual language of dreamlike landscapes, animals, and human figures drawn from recollections of his travels. Themes of sexuality, mythology, and spirituality, along with imaginary narratives of violence, intrigue, fragmentation, love, separation, and jealousy are seen throughout his oeuvre.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nEvery Friday the K2 Lounge offers a special pan-Asian tapas menu to accompany the evening's DJ and programs.

Rockefeller Collection of masterpiece-quality traditional Asian works.<\/p> <p>The collection, universally described as \"gemlike,\" includes objects from cultures across Asia that date from the 11th century BCE to the 19th century CE.<\/p> <p>Asia Society Museum was one of the first American museums to establish a program of contemporary Asian art in the early 1990s. A recognized leader in identifying and fostering contemporary Asian and Asian American artists, the Museum announced the establishment of a Contemporary Art Collection in 2007.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/0\/2\/600_446486114.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Current Exhibition:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Kamakura: Realism and Spirituality in the Sculpture of Japan<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/a\/2\/600_446486274.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The magnificent sculpture of the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) has long been considered a high point in the history of Japanese art. Stylistic and technical innovations led to sculpture that displayed greater realism than ever before. Sculptors began signing their works, allowing us to trace the development of individual and workshop styles that influenced later generations for centuries. Religious developments\u2014often combinations of traditional and new practices\u2014brought devotees into closer proximity with the deities they worshipped.<\/p> <p>The icons in this exhibition commanded the faith of passionate devotees, some of whom hoped to gain merit from the making of a Buddhist image, to ensure salvation in the afterlife, or to obtain tangible benefits in this life. Others aimed to achieve ultimate awakening through ritual unification with the deity represented by the icon. In their original contexts these powerful icons were \u201creal presences,\u201d brought to life by their naturalistic form, ritual activation, and sacred interior contents.<\/p> <p>Craftsmen created these icons during a time of profound political and social disruption. For the first time in Japanese history, powerful warrior clans challenged the imperial court that had dominated the political and cultural landscape for centuries. In the civil war of the 1180s, the great Buddhist temples of the ancient capital in Nara burned to the ground. The devastation shocked the entire country, but rebuilding and repopulating the temples with new sculptures and paintings began almost immediately. Renewed contact with the Asian mainland, which flourished in the early Kamakura period, further invigorated arts and religious practices.<\/p> <p>Elite warriors became an important new source of patronage for religious arts, while the imperial court and aristocratic clergy continued their sponsorship of sculpture workshops in Kyoto and Nara even as their fortunes gradually declined. One major new patron was Minamoto Yoritomo, who became the first ruling shogun and established a military government headquartered in the town of Kamakura in eastern Japan. Later in the thirteenth century, however, the continued threat of invasion by the Mongol empire created further instability. In 1333, a cunning Japanese emperor launched a rebellion ending the Kamakura shogunate not even 150 years after its founding.<\/p> <p>Despite the brevity of this historical period, it had a lasting impact on the political, artistic, and religious legacy of Japan. Shoguns and warlords were the dominant rulers up until the mid-nineteenth century. Even in the eighteenth century, sculptors proudly traced their artistic lineages back to early Kamakura master sculptors, while religious movements established during the period continue to be some of the most popular forms of Buddhism practiced in Japan today.<\/p> <p>Reference Links:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/asiasociety.org\/arts\/asia-society-museum\"><a href=\"http:\/\/asiasociety.org\/arts\/asia-society-museum\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/asiasociety.org\/arts\/asia-society-museum<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-society-and-museum-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-society-and-museum-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/asia-society-and-museum-new-york<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER:<br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.
