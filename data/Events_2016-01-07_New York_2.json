Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

It consists of wavy wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork (\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc ch\u0101sh\u016b), dried seaweed (\u6d77\u82d4 nori), kamaboko, and green onions.

It is sooo good. I'm not really a ramen person but this place has me thinking about my meal a day later, planning when I can visit again. I live in the Heights but this place is special and definitely worth the drive.

He clearly has a passion for this business and I was delighted to learn that he actually took a trip to Japan to sharpen his skills. Definitely admirable!<\/p> <p>Tonkotsu - Creamy, flavorful broth! Not too thick or thin. Comes with scallions, bamboo shoots, sesame seeds, and soft-boiled egg by default - but you can request additional toppings for $1 each. The noodles were a bit too al dente, but I suppose that's just up to preference. On the other hand, their braised pork belly was soooo tender, juicy, and delicious. Just the right amount of fat! In hindsight, I should have asked for two more pieces for $2.<\/p> <p>Roc-N-Punch - \"What's in it?\" To which our server replied, \"What's -not- in it?\" A very tasty and strong cocktail in the prettiest shade of pink, served with a lime wedge. I liked it so much, we ended up ordering three glasses each. ;)<\/p> <p>Cream Puff - The perfect way to end our meal. Dessert with a very light, fluffy, and whipped texture. Wasn't overly sweet, which I really appreciated.<\/p> <p>The owner and staff are so friendly and charismatic; They really know how to make you laugh and feel at home. Service, food, and casual atmosphere were excellent on all accounts. Couldn't recommend this place more!!!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI was staying in the area and looking for some late night food. I showed up a few minutes after closing and they stayed open a little longer to accommodate me. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra chashu.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The broth - Smoky with a hint of sweetness. Rich without being as oily as other tonkotsu broths I've had. Not overly salty.<br\/>Noodles - Thin but not in the standard hakata style. Curly instead of straight. Al dente. Cooked perfectly and was a highlight of the meal.<br\/>Chashu - Seems like they grill it before they drop it into the broth. I like it! It adds a delicious crisp to each bite.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/diningout-219\/events\/227170694\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Let's go to Roc N Ramen in New Rochelle~ for some great Ramen!","id":"227170694","time":1449961200000,"updated":1450558028000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1129506815000,"name":"Cheap Eats and other foodie delights of Westchester","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":211795,"urlname":"diningout-219","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Cheap Eats and Foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443001968000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Discover the Benefits of Buddhist Meditation with a Real Buddhist Monk\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Have you ever wanted to meditate but don\u2019t know where to start?

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/226005005\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":9000000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Saddhasara!","id":"cltxklytqbhb","time":1449961200000,"updated":1450009230000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"68 Jay Street, Suite 503","name":"Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass","lon":-73.986885,"id":24240674,"state":"NY","lat":40.702721,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.2776119709,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449007079000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's been a while.

You can adjust the volume and choose between up to three DJs with a flip of a switch. Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same DJ as you. It\u2019s super social; just lower the volume or take the headphones off and talk to that girl or guy. At the end of the night, be sure to return your headphones as there will be a $100 charge to your credit or debit card if headphones don\u2019t come back.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Awesome-Things-to-Do\/events\/227317829\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":14400000,"name":"FREE Winter Garden Dance Party at Brookfield Place (All Ages)","id":"227317829","time":1449964800000,"updated":1449980589000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1160883321000,"name":"Awesome Things to Do","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":344877,"urlname":"Awesome-Things-to-Do","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Awesome Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":" 50 W 106th St","name":"106th street and Central Park West","lon":-73.961853,"id":24248437,"state":"NY","lat":40.798573,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.67247271538,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449627770000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a repost from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1049675645064475\/1055197491178957\/\">Facebook Event Page<\/a>, please join the fb page to stay updated on this event:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1049675645064475\/1055197491178957\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1049675645064475\/1055197491178957\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1049675645064475\/1055197491178957\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n*****SLEIGH SESSIONS 2015*****<\/p> <p>Sleigh Sessions is a group ride through the mean streets of Manhattan, NYC!

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226887439\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytqbrb","time":1450015200000,"updated":1450027279000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448828461000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i>\u00a0(MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

That loop will be around <b>2\u00be miles<\/b>. There will be an aid station at the trail entrance (and exit), and a race volunteer will direct you on your 5th loop. All entries by <b>December 9<\/b> will receive a colorful crew neck sweat shirt with the \u201cFat Ass\u201d logo.

What exactly is this thing we do called sex and why are so obsessed with it? What makes it so pleasurable, titillating, frightening and shameful? Most of us think the other is satisfied, while we feel frustrated in our own desire and longing.<\/p> <p>The primary processes of sexuality are energetic patterns created in our childhood, which are then mediated through the body. Most of us are not even aware of these energetic habits, such as the difference between being separate or merged or even our own preferences and those of our partners. Unencumbered from such habits, sex can become fresh, alive and open, an art form, a physical prayer, naked, unafraid and raw. Beyond self union, lies a greater union, a total orgasm with the whole, with Source itself.<\/p> <p>This day long journey will be an exploration of how we can gain a conscious choosing over what and how our sexual energy moves. From pleasure to sharing, to heightening the spiritual embodiment of your sexuality, we will be in conscious exploration and discovery of these energies in you and how they affect your relationships.<\/p> <p>The Awakened Sexuality Project is for participants who are longing for a deep spiritual journey and a strong willingness to venture and play where angels fear to tread. We will be working in the deep unconscious, uncovering where we turn away from some of our greatest gifts by delving into what has been deemed unspeakable and taboo. Through exploration of sexual fantasies, sexual constellation work, untamed passions, conscious play, body work, breath work, movement, intimacy, connection and respectful service to each other, we can come home to ourselves through a deep honoring of our gorgeous, unique and individual ways of loving.<\/p> <p>When: Sunday Dec 13th, 2015, 10:00AM ~ 5:00 PM<br\/>Where: Institute of Core Energetics,<br\/>150 West 28th street, suite 1803, New York<\/p> <p>Admission: $150 before Nov 22nd, 2015, $175 after<\/p> <p>Tickets:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/sexual-fantasies-meeting-your-dark-attraction-awakening-to-love-tickets-19152986097\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/sexual-fantasies-meeting-your-dark-attraction-awakening-to-love-tickets-19152986097\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/sexual-fantasies-meeting-your-dark-attraction-awakening-to-love-tickets-19152986097<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>When you register or attend, please make a point to tell the facilitator that you heard about this event from the Pleasure Without Borders Meetup<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/c\/1\/600_441028865.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid is the Director of The Institute of Integral Evolutionary Tantra, New York City.

GPS: N[masked] W[masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>NOTES ABOUT THIS HIKE<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>This hike is located on the very western edge of Greene County. The hike is outside of the blue line of the Catskill Mountain Park. This is a quick way to the top of vly and bearpen mountain. There are quite a few view points, and the views from Bearpen mountain are spectacular. Vly Mountain does not have views. This hike is also one of the easier hikes in the Catskill Mountains. There are numerous trails to the summit of Bearpen Mountain. Bearpen Mountain used to be a downhill ski center. Vly Mountain is a bushwhack hike. There is a herd path to the summit. The herd path can be difficult to follow during certain times of the year. Other times it is easy to follow.<\/p> <p>This is the shortest way to the top of vly and bearpen mountain. The road from Rt 3 from Fleischmanns is the favored route by those who want the shortest hike to the top.<\/p> <p>There is NO registration box. This is a wild forest, so you can find snowmobiles running around in the Winter. But, we never see many, and the few we see break the trail for us. Bearpen Wild Forest does get more snow then the rest of the Catskill Mountains.<\/p> <p>Vly Mountain can be climbed from three common routes. The route we will take is from Rt 3 from Fleischmanns. This route is the shortest and easist route to the top of Vly Mountain. It is about 1.78 miles to the top. Most people use this route. The difficult part of this route is the parking. You cannot park in the snowplow turnaround, but you can park on the shoulder of the road on the other side of the mountain.<\/p> <p>The road up to the summit is a nice easy incline that runs pretty steady. It is about 1 mile long. When you get to the summit, there is a Hunter's Cabin. The road is wide enough for a truck, and can be used by the public. Once at the pass, you will find the herd path on the right side of the road. It is just past the DEC Wild Forest sign. The climb up to Vly Mountain is moderate or difficult in ability. Nothing terrible. It is easy to fall off the trail, so you do have to be careful certain times of the year. Other times of the year, the path is quite well defined and easy to follow. About 3\/4 of the way up the mountain there is a limited view. Once on top there is no view. Once you are done, hike back down to Rt 3 to the pass by the Hunter's Cabin.<\/p> <p>Now, walk past the front porch of the Hunter's Cabin. This trail will lead you to Bearpen Mountain. At the trail junction, take a LEFT. Climb uphill along the steeper trail. You will come to a switchback. About 250' past the switchback is a new (2010) snowmobile trail. It is marked with NYS DEC snowmobile trail marker. You can follow this trail for about a 1\/2 mile. After a 1\/2 mile, there is a faint herd trail on the right. You can take this herd trail for a short cut. Or, you can follow the snowmobile trail to the end. It will come to another snowmobile trail. You then will take a LEFT. You will come to the summit of Bearpen Mountain. Once you are done you can reverse your course back to your car.<\/p> <p>There are numerous great views from the summit of vly and bearpen mountain. Take the time to find most of them. Most of the views are spectacular. This mountain is a loved by snowshoers and cross-crountry skiers for good hiking and great views. Some find it quite magical. <b><\/p> <p><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>DISTANCE: <\/b>Approximately 6.5 miles<\/p> <p><b>HIKING PACE:<\/b> up to 2 mph<\/p> <p><b>ESTIMATED HIKE TIME:<\/b> up to 4-5 hours<\/p> <p><b>DIFFICULTY:<\/b> Intermediate with bushwhacking<\/p> <p><b>CURRENT WEATHER FORECAST: <\/b>Cloudy with a high of 53 degrees<\/p> <p><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>RECOMMENDED GEAR:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Headlamp <\/b>with spare batteries - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lowes.com\/pd_665652-346-ECR2430___?productId=999908127&amp;pl=1&amp;Ntt=headlight+energizer\">Lowe's has an Energizer 200 Lumen headlamp for only $19.97<\/a><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Shoes with good grip<\/b> - preferably with ankle support<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>A Medium Pack<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>Related maps<\/b>, a <b>Compass<\/b> or <b>GPS<\/b>, <b>Enough Water<\/b> for entire day, <b>Snacks<\/b>, <b>First Aid<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Windbreaker<\/b>, <b>warm layers<\/b>, <b>hat<\/b>, <b>gloves<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Gaiters<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>Hiking Poles<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>RELATED MAPS:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nynjtc.org\/product\/new-catskill-trails-map-set-maps-hiking-catskills\">New York - New Jersey Trail Conference - Catskills Trails Map Set<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/0\/0\/600_443285632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>\"BUSHWHACKS\"<\/b> are hikes that leave maintained trails through pure wilderness.\u00a0 Please make sure you are confident in your ability to hike and navigate through wild forest without trails in case your fearless leader should get hurt and you need to go for help (unlikely - lol).\u00a0 A Map &amp; Compass are REQUIRED.

But she knows she's not a boy. She knows she's a girl.<\/p> <p>George thinks she'll have to keep this a secret forever. Then her teacher announces that their class play is going to be Charlotte's Web. George really, really, REALLY wants to play Charlotte. But the teacher says she can't even try out for the part . . . because she's a boy. With the help of her best friend, Kelly, George comes up with a plan. Not just so she can be Charlotte -- but so everyone can know who she is, once and for all.<\/p> <p>NY Times Review:'<br\/>Prepare yourself, Alex Gino: You\u2019ll be receiving lots of feedback when readers discover your timely, touching novel.<br\/>School librarians will run to you at conferences, thanking you for writing a story that speaks to students like George. Irate parents will leave one-star reviews on Amazon, claiming your book has an agenda. And there will be children \u2014 you know, the actual intended audience for \u201cGeorge\u201d \u2014 who will send you an email, politely demanding a sequel.<br\/>You can\u2019t blame them for asking. The memorable central character of \u201cGeorge\u201d is unlike almost any protagonist out there \u2014 even if others in the story are stock characters of middle-grade books. (A harried single mom, a macho older brother, a sassy best girlfriend \u2014 archetypes, I hasten to add, I\u2019ve relied on in my own novels.)<br\/>But \u201cGeorge\u201d stands out for one contemporary twist: a fourth-grade production of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d in which George dreams of playing Charlotte, the female spider, rather than Wilbur, the male pig. It\u2019s not for political reasons; Charlotte is simply the role to which George most relates. With refreshingly little fanfare, Gino uses the \u201cherself\u201d pronoun to describe how George sees, well, herself \u2014 despite a birth certificate that says otherwise.<br\/>\u201cGeorge\u201d may be the most right-now book imaginable. How do you talk to children about Caitlyn Jenner? Give them \u201cGeorge\u201d (and watch \u201cI Am Cait\u201d together). Also, trust that when you tell a contemporary child that some people are born into a body they don\u2019t identify with, most will blink, say, \u201cO.K., cool,\u201d and ask what\u2019s for dinner.<br\/>Gino beautifully describes how George thinks about holding the ladder for her best friend, Kelly, after Kelly gets cast in the high-flying role George wants: She \u201cwould be Charlotte\u2019s Charlotte, deeply hidden in the shadows.\u201d Elsewhere, Gino uses escalating variations on an everyday word \u2014 \u201cOh,\u201d then \u201cOhhh,\u201d then \u201cOhhhhhhhhh\u201d \u2014 to brilliantly depict the dawning way George\u2019s older brother reacts to learning that his little bro is actually his kid sis. These moments are drawn with elegant restraint, even if other aspects of the book \u2014 like how George\u2019s mom watches soap operas and George\u2019s brother refers to \u201cdirty magazines\u201d \u2014 feel dated.<br\/>Using the theater as a backdrop, however, is both age-old and inspired. If outcasts escape into the theater in order to \u201cbe\u201d other people, the opposite is also the case: Theater is the only place some kids can be themselves. The \u201cunderstudy must go on\u201d theme is deployed to lovely effect as George steps into the arachnid role she was born to play.<br\/>Gino\u2019s choice of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d resonates for another reason: Anyone who thinks children won\u2019t believe that a boy knows he\u2019s really a girl need only pick up \u201cCharlotte\u201d to be reminded that a barnful of talking animals never confused anyone.<br\/>After reading \u201cGeorge,\u201d I pulled out my own dog-eared edition of E.B.

It's time once again for our Photos with Santa and Secret Santa Gift Exchange!<\/p> <p>Our favorite \"Man in Red\", Santa, will be offering the *best seat in the house*, for all good NNJPE Pugs (and some not-so-good ones that just think they are)! Why bother dreaming about sugar plums and treats, when you can bark at Santa directly?!?<\/p> <p>The *Pug Shot* Photos with Santa to be taken at this event will be offered at a cost of $5.00 for\u00a0each 4x6 inch photo or\u00a02 for $8.00; revenue generated will be distributed as donations to\u00a0Coming Home\u00a0Rescue,\u00a0Rockaway, NJ, while \"Angel Tree\"\u00a0donations will be given to RBARI (Ramapo Bergen Animal Rescue), and Hi Tor Animal Shelter, Rockland County, NY. (Payment\u00a0is to be made directly to Best Friends the day of the event.) BTW; just to let everyone know...Best Friends is a mere few seconds North of the Montvale, NJ border in the town of Chestnut Ridge, NY; it's closer than it sounds...:)<\/p> <p>Along with the photo session, we will be hosting our fun-filled Secret Santa event! Anyone wishing to participate in this event is asked to bring a new, wrapped doggie-related item (or items) valued at approximately $15.00. The item(s) should be something of which can be utilized either by a dog or a dog\/Pug lover, so the possibilities are endless! The gifts will then be tagged with numbered tickets, and will then be distributed via a drawing in which each participating member will \"win\" the gift with the matching number on his\/her ticket stub. If you have two Pugs (or more!), bring two gifts (or more!) and you can draw for that many gifts!<\/p> <p>Of course, your participation in either of these sessions is purely optional; you and your Pug can join us simply for the indoor, off-leash playtime; the choice is yours. Finally; any food or beverage contributions are appreciated, as this will be a fee-free event and our last meetup of the year. Let's celebrate the splendor of the season and the last few days of 2015 with one gala Pug Party; we hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>***UPDATE! No proof of vaccination will be necessary for our group, which will, in turn, allow any Pug who has their basic Rabies shot to attend. (We will be the only group utilizing the playroom at our scheduled time, so Best Friends is forgoing their boarding vaccination policy.) WOO HOO! The one change to our utilizing the playroom, however, is that there will be a nominal $25.00 per hour charge for use of the room (which is very reasonable!). With this in mind, I am asking all attendees to chip in for the room expenses, which should be no more than $2.00-$2.50 per person (based upon the number of attendees). \u00a0This amount can be paid the day of the event. Note that I have changed the start time of the event to 11:30 AM, as the Photos with Santa session will follow AFTER our playroom time. (This time slot might be subjected to some \"minor tweaking\" as we get closer to the day of the event...thanks in advance for your understanding and patience!).<\/p> <p>Happy Holidays to Everyone and Everypug!<\/p> <p>Ellen, along with our friends at Best Friends!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Northern-New-Jersey-Pug\/events\/226567679\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":5400000,"name":"10th Annual NNJPE Photos with Santa and Secret Santa Gift Exchange!","id":"226567679","time":1450024200000,"updated":1450102651000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1149359577000,"name":"NORTHERN NEW JERSEY PUG EXTRAVAGANZA!","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":257664,"urlname":"Northern-New-Jersey-Pug","group_lat":41.0600013733,"who":"Pugaholics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10983","country":"us","city":"Tappan","address_1":"32 Old Tappan Rd","name":"The Tappan Reformed Church's Manse Barn and Grounds","lon":-73.95047,"id":3768222,"state":"NY","lat":41.023743,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.0648078918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440357418000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The Rockland Center for Spiritual Living has been in existence since 2005.

Each model fascinates with elegance, simplicity and fitting for purpose - basically, a whole new approach to architecture and design!\u00a0<\/p> <p>The experience is brought into the 21st century with newly installed touch screen tables and pens that allow you to create your own designs or investigate existing objects, and save them for future review.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/227273645\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytqbrb","time":1450026000000,"updated":1450038233000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11225","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"171 East Dr","name":"LeFrak Center at Lakeside","lon":-73.96405,"id":21675432,"state":"NY","lat":40.657063,"repinned":true},"headcount":0,"distance":12.669011116,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449693416000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Winter is here!

Louise Ann is of Italian and Greek decent and has been published in various glamour and urban magazines, as well as calendars. We're happy to have her join our group and look forward to having her become a regular.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About this Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned. (with a possible 4th pending time) First look will be a more Fashion inspired\/edgy implied look. (Topless implied. Possible outdoor look pending weather which is supposed to be in 60's this Sunday.) Second look will be a nude implied Christmas theme. (Nude Implied with sheets, santa hat or props.) Third look will be implied bodyscapes with a Christmas inspired rhinestone twist.\u00a0Fourth possible look is implied with ribbons and bow wrapped around body and strategically placed on private parts, pinup style.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup so you know what to expect at the shoot.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>NEW:\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $30 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/30.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(Balance due at time of shoot: $50, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.)<\/p> <p>(PDF version, Non-Commercial Model Release provided to email registered upon check-in.)<\/p> <p><b>Model:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Louise Ann:<\/b><\/p> <p>(Photo Credits: NandoPro)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/c\/9\/600_444892425.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/8\/6\/600_444895430.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/8\/4\/600_444895428.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/8\/2\/600_444895426.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Policy and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>One-on-One:<\/b>\u00a0The model will be available for one half hour one on one shoot after the first two hours in the Meetup. If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away.

Why not dance it?<\/p> <p>Healing begins from the inside out. JourneyDance is a blend of improvisational theater, dance, yoga, guided movement meditations with the intention to feel and heal. Movement creates magic and when the body is allowed to express feelings and safe space is created for emotions to flow, we are able to embrace our imperfections celebrate our strengths while opening our hearts and setting our souls free. Sometimes we dance on our own, other times we dance with the group or a partner, always we dance supported by the JourneyDance Facilitator in a safe healing space. No mirrors or judgment, we do not subscribe to social codes that hold hold us back.<\/p> <p>All are welcome at JourneyDance with Jeanine, both genders, all sizes, ages, races, spiritualities, sexual orientations... we are dancing diversity. Segregation breeds ignorance. Let's integrate not only our chakras, but our dancing, healing, community with friends of all races, sizes, sexual orientations both genders. Dance the peace you want to see and be. GENERAL STUDIO INQUIRIES PLEASE EMAIL:<br\/>[masked]<br\/>What people are saying about JourneyDance with Jeanine:<\/p> <p>Journey Dance with you and the group last night was awesome. My work day (days) and personal life being so stressful lately, I knew I needed something other than my private practice to 'loosen up,' free my mind, and remember my own magical self. So when I chose to attend and take the journey you guided us through: dancing with the gifts of the solar plexus chakra, among all the other goodies we explore, it was the best thing I could have done. I felt 1000% better afterwards. You have the unique ability to create a beautiful welcoming space - and play great music - so I can feel safe to surrender, really, actually work through \"stuff,\" connect with other awesome people where we've 'got each other's backs,' and have fun! Thank you Jeanine!<\/p> <p>Love &amp; Gratitude,<\/p> <p>~Nechama, NY, NY<\/p> <p>I really wanted to tell you how much I enjoy you as a facilitator and coach. You bring a level of authenticity that shines through and puts me, for one, at ease. I have been trying to pinpoint what is is exactly and how its different from other people I have met or worked with - cause I think its awesome and I wanted to communicate to you so you can keep doing it BUT I feel like you bring your youness and its working! So a big YAY of support to you!~ Alina Tsirkin NY, NY<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JourneyDance\/events\/224566630\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"JourneyDance with Jeanine at Pure Yoga West","id":"224566630","time":1450031400000,"updated":1450039720000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1274500758000,"name":"JourneyDance NYC","group_lon":-74,"id":1649260,"urlname":"JourneyDance","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"JourneyDancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":3,"distance":10.5748910904,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449764496000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I was called by a member of the AMA soaring club, as well as the Booton Township chief of police, telling me we are <b>NOT<\/b> allowed to fly at Boonton Airfield<\/p> <p>\n\n... so back at our usual field..<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/0\/f\/600_442026159.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>If gate is chained, follow the arrows below and we'll park where we parked last week - but this time, cross the bridge to the west of the first parking lot and climb the hill to our usual field...<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/c\/4\/600_444951652.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nj-Dug\/events\/227339630\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":12600000,"name":"Fly-In 'among the trees'","id":"227339630","time":1450031400000,"updated":1450591578000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1271057338000,"name":"NJ Drone User Group","group_lon":-74.1299972534,"id":1629197,"urlname":"Nj-Dug","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Flyers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"10 Lincoln Center Plaza","name":"Lincoln Center - David Geffen Hall","lon":-73.983322,"id":23972135,"state":"NY","lat":40.771725,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":7,"distance":1.54418051243,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449504525000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please bring a book or laptop.\u00a0 They have wifi &amp; we can look at the Dax edition of Tractatus together.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Nerds stand out in this cafe.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wittgensteins-Tractatus-What-Can-Be-Said-Clearly\/events\/227270530\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Speak about statements and ask if this is (il)legitimate in what sense and why","id":"227270530","time":1450032300000,"updated":1450106399000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440680783000,"name":"Wittgenstein's Tractatus- What Can Be Said Clearly","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18873443,"urlname":"Wittgensteins-Tractatus-What-Can-Be-Said-Clearly","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Idea consumers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":62,"headcount":0,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":8,"created":1441398886000,"fee":{"amount":18,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/d\/e\/highres_64103262.jpeg\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Everyone,<\/p> <p><br\/>Our first 1-day Tournament of the season is here!!

We have one of the largest pet owner groups on Meetup.com in NYC. However, we simply cannot do indoor Meetups in a space that size.<\/p> <p><br\/>- We've been looking into new venues like privately-owned doggie daycare places, and so far, none I've seen have a play space of comparable size, or are open to the notion of accommodating 30-40 dogs and their owners showing up at once (at least in Manhattan, where we try to remain centrally-based for everyone).<\/p> <p><br\/>- From a \"business standpoint\", this is kind of a big deal in another way:<\/p> <p>A small portion of the proceeds from our winter Meetups have historically funded the group for the remainder of the year, the rest was donated to Animal Haven - any new space we find would need to be both economical and still amenable to sharing any income so we can pay our twice-yearly Meetup.com group subscription, which increased this year due to our group's size to $180\/year.<\/p> <p><br\/>- To be perfectly honest, this has all taken us and many other NYC dog Meetup organizers completely by surprise.<\/p> <p><br\/>Animal Haven has been our go-to indoor venue since the group was founded in 2006, and frankly, we hadn't thought of any other options, because we never needed to. They've essentially been woven into our DNA from the start, and gave us no early indication or warning they had plans to move until we approached them several weeks ago to schedule this winter's Meetups.

On a dark and stormy night in 1954, six individuals with ties to Washington are assembled for a dinner party at the swanky mansion of one Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving). Boddy's butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry), assigns each guest a colorful name: Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), and Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn). Two additional servants, the Cook (Kellye Nakahara) and Yvette, the maid (Colleen Camp), assist Wadsworth as he informs the guests that they have been gathered to meet the man who has been blackmailing them: Mr. Boddy. When Boddy turns up dead, however, the guests must try to figure out who killed him so they can protect their own reputations and keep the body count from growing. Three separate endings were filmed for Clue and shown in different theaters; all three are collected for the video edition. Although the film is set in the 1950s, the original Clue game was actually devised by Anthony Pratt, a clerk in Leeds, England, to pass the time during World War II air-raid drills. First released in 1946 under the name Cluedo by British manufacturer Waddington's, Clue was renamed and released in the U.S. in 1949. Today, Clue\/Cluedo is marketed in 70 countries around the world and has been adapted into a British game show and an off-Broadway musical.<\/p> <p><br\/>Get your free tickets here:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/svatheatre.com\/events\/clue-a-30th-anniversary-screening-in-35mm-film\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/svatheatre.com\/events\/clue-a-30th-anniversary-screening-in-35mm-film\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/svatheatre.com\/events\/clue-a-30th-anniversary-screening-in-35mm-film\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/227171359\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Clue 35mm film print FREE Screening at SVA starts at 3pm","id":"227171359","time":1450035000000,"updated":1450046900000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"356 W. 44th St.","name":"Quinn's","lon":-73.99131,"id":16369082,"state":"NY","lat":40.759323,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.64913970232,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449528342000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's keep things rolling at El Madrigal following the very good outing from last week.

It\u2019s a supple canvas to be stretched and bent to the whims of the imagination. Her eye-popping take on the canon\u2019s most enchanted comedy\u2026 confirms Ms. Taymor\u2019s reputation as the cosmic P. T. Barnum of contemporary stagecraft\u2026 This Dream exists\u2026 as a glittering necklace of breathtaking moments\u2026 [and] when the moments are this beautiful, they take root in your mind and assume lives of their own. Don\u2019t be surprised when they start showing up in your own dreams. The ingeniously mixed music of Elliot Goldenthal ranges from anxious jazz riffs to sustained, ethereal lullabies.\u201d - Ben Brantley - The New York Times<\/p> <p>Presenting Julie Taymor\u2019s much heralded and sold-out production of\u00a0A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, filmed at Theatre For A New Audience, Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, New York in 2014. Taymor is the creative force behind such productions as\u00a0The Magic Flute\u00a0(Metropolitan Opera),\u00a0Across the Universe,Frida, and of course the highest grossing Broadway musical of all time,\u00a0The Lion King. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Of all Shakespeare's plays,\u00a0A Midsummer Night's Dream\u00a0is the most phantasmagorical, featuring fairies, spells, and hallucinatory lovers. Julie Taymor turns out a production that's visually breathtaking, funny, sexy and darkly poetic. With cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Argo,\u00a0Frida) and music by Academy Award-winning composer Elliot Goldenthal, this is an immersive, inventive cinematic experience that was filmed during the show\u2019s highly acclaimed inaugural run.

Come on out for a fun little gifting &amp; swapping get-together immediately following our regularly scheduled monthly meeting. Here\u2019s the concept: bring a book wrapped and ribboned, and receive one wrapped and ribboned.<\/p> <p>What should I bring? One of your favorite titles you've read in the past year or two, not featured by our group during that time. One that particularly stuck out to you, satisfied your literary cravings better than you expected, and left that indelible mark on your mind or heart or both.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Any other criteria? Well, the only particular suggestion would be to bring a fiction book valued at between $10 and $25. Other than that, it can be hard or soft, old or new, long or short, a prize winner or a hidden gem.\u00a0<\/p> <p>So, what happens? Everyone who comes will bring their one gift-wrapped book. We\u2019ll put them all into one big bag and toss \u2018em around a bit. We\u2019ll then have a box with numbered slips. After everyone pulls a number, we\u2019ll start with whoever picks the number one, and then we\u2019ll proceed on down the numerical line. Then the best part: we all unwrap at the same time. You can chat with the person who picked your book, or they can keep mum, it\u2019s all up to you guys. Swapping will be allowed\u2014for example, if you already own the book\u2014so we hope there\u2019ll be no hurt feelings among the gifters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Is there a catch? What would life be without those endearing catches we all know and love *wink*. Once you have your book, you promise to talk briefly about it at our January meeting. You won\u2019t have to do it alone necessarily: your gifter can talk about it too, and anyone else who has read your particular title.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Any other questions? No? Good!

EFT is a simple yet incredibly effective method of self healing that can be used to immediately reduce anxiety, stress, and other emotions that stand in our way of living in a place of optimum well-being and personal peace. Together we will work on individual and collective issues of concern. The more of us who tap together in a group format, the more benefit can be received by all.<\/p> <p>At this meetup we will continue exploring the nature of our mind and emotions and learn how to identify \u2018stories\u2019 we tell about ourselves that contribute to any sense of personal 'Not-OKness'. Then we can release the charge these stories carry with EFT and increase our personal Emotional Freedom!<\/p> <p><br\/>One of the special features of our Meetup is that we demonstrate how we have unconscious blocks to happiness and Emotional Freedom.

FEIH is now in the process of building their first school! The organization has made a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to build 5 schools in 3 years. With the help of the entire FEIH Team, which a few of our members are a part of, the organization broke ground in October. The construction is almost complete and they will inaugurate the Santiago Morales School on January 16th, 2016. FEIH is now looking to now collect $5,000 to purchase backpacks and school supplies for the students in the community. With as little as $35, a child will receive a backpack filled with an entire year of school supplies and a PenPal letter from students in the NYC area.\u00a0Check out their website\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.feih.org\/\">www.feih.org<\/a>\u00a0and learn how your donation impacts the underprivileged children of the poor rural communities in El Progreso, Honduras.

It houses some of the most extravagant Christmas light displays in the country that are mostly done professionally. They involve over-the-top Lights, large inflatable Christmas decorations, and motorized holiday displays. It is a place the must be seen during the holiday season and is fun for the entire family. It also presents an unmatched opportunity for photographers to get great holiday lightnings and decorations pictures taken. It is also presents challenging conditions for night photography which makes taking pictures there even more exciting.<\/p> <p>We recently covered all the principles for taking great holiday decorations pictures at night time. This trip is to practice what we learned in the studio. I will be available throughout the trip to assist in getting each team member taking memorable pictures.<\/p> <p>For those reasons, <b>only those that attended the \"Introduction to Night Photography Class\" can register for this field trip<\/b>. I am also limiting the number of participants to five including me.

After meeting and proposing to a young woman, he falls into a lengthy affair with an Italian bartender and is confounded and tortured by his sexual identity as he oscillates between the two.\" Hope you can make it. :) Look forward to meeting and discussing the book.

Both highly accomplished holistic healers, traveling all the way from Seattle, WA, they are worth your while and notice! You can trust their expertise and intuition. This time - they are taking you on a journey through your past lives with Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique.<\/p> <p>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) is Dolores Cannon's method of hypnosis, which involves inducing an individual into the Somnambulistic state of trance through visualization. Past Life Regression is the first component of Dolores' QHHT technique and involves the individual being regressed and guided through an appropriate past life from the first scene they first view, throughout the various periods of the life and eventually through to the death scene.<\/p> <p>The Subconscious will select what past life to show the individual and they will be guided through it by the QHHT practitioner conducting the session. The past life the Subconscious chooses to show an individual is always relevant to the current life the individual is living now and it is not uncommon for multiple Past Lives to be shown during a single session. The QHHT practitioner will navigate an individual through a Past Life using a series of questions to help determine the time period and social setting of the life.<\/p> <p>What is The Subconscious?<\/p> <p>Dolores' Definition<br\/>The Subconscious that was contacted by Dolores and the practitioners of her QHHT technique is the polar opposite to the subconscious referred to by psychologists and conventional medical professionals. During her early years as a hypnotherapist, Dolores became aware that through her unique technique of induction she was contacting and communicating with a portion of an individual's consciousness that was indeed a part of them, yet lay far above the level of their conscious mind, which is the part of ourselves we are aware of and use to interact with others on a personal level.The Subconscious is a suitable label given the context of Dolores' work; however, religions and spiritual teachers alike have attempted to identify and label this larger part of ourselves throughout history using a variety of different labels: the Higher Self, the Oversoul, Christ Consciousness, Higher Consciousness, the Universal Mind and Oneness. The Subconscious had stated to Dolores that it does not care what we call it, it simply \"Is\" and is willing to work with those with a pure heart and true intent.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/THE-COMMUNITY-OF-HEALING\/events\/227327768\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"\"Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique\"","id":"227327768","time":1450045800000,"updated":1450052411000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1365640565000,"name":"THE COMMUNITY OF HEALING NJ\/NY\/PA","group_lon":-74.2300033569,"id":8012352,"urlname":"THE-COMMUNITY-OF-HEALING","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07042","country":"us","city":"Montclair","phone":"(973)744-2600","address_1":"6 Depot Square","name":"Trumpets Jazz Club","lon":-74.210701,"id":764937,"state":"NJ","lat":40.817122,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":12.4683094025,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447478643000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come see a number of ensembles, including mine!

The IML, adjusted for the common risk factors, measures the illiquidity premium whose annual alpha is about 4% over the period 1950-2012. I then test whether the systematic risk (\u03b2) of IML is priced in a multi-factor CAPM. The model allows for a conditional \u03b2 of IML that rises with observable funding illiquidity and adverse market conditions. The conditional IML \u03b2 is positively and significantly priced, and remains so after controlling for the beta of illiquidity shocks.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Yakov Amihud<\/b><\/p> <p>is Ira Rennert Professor of Entrepreneurial Finance at the Stern School of Business, New York University.\u00a0 He is the coauthor of<\/p> <p><i>Market Liquidity: Asset Pricing, Risk and Crises<\/i><\/p> <p>(Cambridge University Press, 2013).

You will gain an understanding of what EF is for, how it works, where it belongs in your software architecture, and how to get it there. You\u2019ll gain hands on experience with the basics of using EF from designing a simple model to interacting with that to persist data from your application. In addition to getting developers started with EF and prepared to learn and take advantage of more advanced techniques, this course will provide managers with the info they need to help them with decision making when planning a development stack. We\u2019ll be using Visual Studio 2015 and .NET 4.6 for demos.<\/p> <p><b>About the Author: \u00a0<\/b><b>Julie Lerman<\/b> has been programming and mentoring other developers for over 25 years and brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to share with Pluralsight subscribers.

Taking a risk is central to everything worthwhile in life. Everything you really want in life involves taking a risk. You cannot grow without taking a risk, a chance. Like all risks, growing requires giving something up without knowing for certain if the next step will be any better. In every risk there is some unavoidable loss, something that has to be given up to move ahead. A dynamic life is a life full of risks, but not hazardous risks where a person takes unnecessary [and potentially dangerous] chances.

Part 2 describes different types of mind in detail, revealing the depth and profundity of the Buddhist understanding of the mind.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

And, time matters still. From project deadlines to leisure time to meetings, time is as precious a commodity as ever. Some even want to recast the way technology is measured by a \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jT5rRh9AZf4\">time well spent<\/a>\" (YouTube video) standard. Then enter Getting Things Done (GTD), not a <i><b>time<\/b> management<\/i> methodology but an <i><b>action<\/b> management<\/i> methodology. David Allen's GTD doesn't remove time from the personal management equation but he defines how to manage our personal and professional lives through the lens of our actions toward goals. Notwithstanding, he tells us how we use our time, and he gives us rubrics for what should appear in our calendars.<\/p> <p>In this month's Meetup, I'd like for us to discuss the ways in which we manage our calendars while practicing GTD. More often than not, we use our calendars more for things GTD doesn't necessarily profess, but it works for us. That's the power of GTD; it knows how to step aside and let productivity happen! And, when it doesn't work, David Allen has provided an \"ideal practice\" for us to support us back toward productivity. Join us for this Meetup where we will be discussing calendaring, time management, time blocking and time chunking, calendar\/agenda\/scheduling software\/mobile applications, and more!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please feel free to bring your copy of GTD, your questions and thoughts on minimalism and simple living as well! Your conversation contributions are what make the discussions awesome!<\/p> <p>Directly after this month's Meetup, we will be heading directly to our annual <b>GTD Holiday Gathering<\/b>!

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation.

Cafe Frida is a well known Mexican Restaurant in the Upper West Side that has agreed to be 100% vegan for a night. If the event is successful then they will continue serving some of the veganized dishes on their daily menu and they will become the first of many to officially veganize. Joaquin Martinez from the restaurant group is thrilled to host this event and has even encouraged me to consider his other restaurants throughout the city! In a letter from the founder, Christina Castaneda, she writes<\/p> <p>\"Cooking in Mexico is not just about combining ingredients. It is a culture, a celebration, an art and the heart of the family \u2013 and sometimes, a sacred feast for the gods...Today\u2019s food trends lean towards the healthy and the uncomplicated... The intense competition and demand for healthier food means we must raise the quality of flavors...\"<\/p> <p>Before The Event:<\/p> <p>Veganizer will work with the kitchen to ensure that Cafe Frida serves 100% vegan dishes to our meet-up.<\/p> <p>On the night of the event.<\/p> <p>Take lots of photos and video!

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

We hope that by being together, listening to each other, and by sharing our experiences, strength and hope, we will learn to see the value of life in a new context. For the first hour of each meeting members share their experiences. The second half of the meeting is reserved for a guest speaker relating to either the legal or emotional aspects of separation\/divorce.
