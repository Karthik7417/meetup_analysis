We\u2019ll also have potlucks, picnics, and discover fun, ethnic dishes.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/2\/e\/600_435853358.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Our group is not about collecting the most members possible. This is the place to develop real friendships with other \u201cveggies\u201d and create genuine bonds. I try to keep the number of members on the smaller side so we can all get to know every member personally. Some of our events may be non-food related, such as karaoke or bowling. Therefore, everyone is encouraged to suggest new events to any restaurant or activity she may be interested in.<\/p>\n<p>So&nbsp;if you're living as a vegan, or are interested in exploring new meat-free eateries while making great friends, please join! All are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Please make sure to have a <span><b>CLEAR <\/b>photo of yourself <strong>(FACE)<\/strong> and <strong>answer ALL QUESTIONS<\/strong><\/span>. It gives me and the other members a better idea of who you are :-) To help keep the group small, I tend to delete inactive members after a few months. So the only way to stay is to show that pretty mug of yours :)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/4\/0\/600_435853376.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><span>If you take a look at our pictures, you'll see we're a very active group, so if you want to join us on meetup, you better be ready to actually come out and \"<\/span><em>MEET UP!<\/em><span>\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Lets Eat!<\/p>\n<p>*Must be at least 21 to join <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/2\/9\/highres_445225129.jpeg","photo_id":445225129,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/2\/9\/600_445225129.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/2\/9\/thumb_445225129.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":83321992,"name":"Esosa","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/0\/8\/highres_210276872.jpeg","photo_id":210276872,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/0\/8\/member_210276872.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/0\/8\/thumb_210276872.jpeg"}},"members":375,"name":"NYC Vegan Foodies -- Young women (20's to mid 30's)","id":9398292,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Vegan-Foodies-Young-women-20s-to-mid-30s","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Foodies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1374093707000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"agile-project-management","name":"Agile Project Management","id":21549},{"urlkey":"kanban","name":"Kanban","id":37339},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"lean-project-management","name":"Lean Project Management","id":118991},{"urlkey":"agile-coaching","name":"Agile Coaching","id":122939},{"urlkey":"agile-leadership","name":"Agile Leadership","id":438272},{"urlkey":"agile-transformation","name":"Agile Transformation","id":438282},{"urlkey":"agile-portfolio-management","name":"Agile Portfolio Management","id":1106892},{"urlkey":"agile-program-management","name":"Agile Program Management","id":1106902},{"urlkey":"scaled-agile-framework-safe","name":"Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)","id":1106912}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ScalingAgileNYC\/","rating":4.7,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in learning more about the Scaled Agile Framework, Disciplined Agile Delivery, and just how to scale agile practices in the enterprise.\u00a0 We share and discuss experiences implementing any and all portions of the framework,\u00a0 lessons learned, retrospectives, progress, successes and those experiences that are less than positive in bringing Agile transformations to the enterprise level.

It\u2019s gathering for anyone who wants to live better, help often and wonder more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We started in London in January 2013 and we accidentally became a movement. There are now Assemblies in Exeter, Melbourne, New York and Bristol, with Southend and Brighton starting soon. The Sunday Assembly is the brainchild of comedians Sanderson Jones (bearded, over-excitable, international purveyor of The Comedy Sale) and Pippa Evans (musical, hilarious, BBC Radio 4, 4 Extra, The Showstoppers) who discovered on one long car journey to a gig that they were both thinking about starting a friendly community gathering for like-minded people.<\/p>\n<p><span>We aren't just a single event either. Browse through the listings here of our various outings, groups and volunteer opportunities and you'll probably find something you'd like to do (and possibly some things that don't interest you even slightly). We're doing so many cool things!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>All of our events are free and open to the public...though donations are always welcome! We are non-religious, radically inclusive and seek to build a strong, supportive community in our city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Come along on this quest to bring reason, encouragement, and wonder into the lives of anyone who wants to join in with us! &nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2493123,"name":"Michael Trollan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/9\/e\/6\/highres_36275302.jpeg","photo_id":36275302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/9\/e\/6\/member_36275302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/9\/e\/6\/thumb_36275302.jpeg"}},"members":591,"name":"Sunday Assembly - NYC","id":9474332,"state":"NY","urlname":"Sunday-Assembly-NYC","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Assemblers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1374594871000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bowling","name":"Bowling","id":373},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-sports-league","name":"Co-Ed Adult Sports League","id":78095}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Happy-Hour-Fun-Nightlife-Crew\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>This group is all about happy hours and fun nightlife events for young professionals in their 20s-30s!

One host will cook the meal and each guest will pay a small fee to compensate the host. All levels of cooking (and eating) experience are welcome!

While many of our members have eliminated employment altogether, others still work full time, part-time, flex-time, night shifts, have home-based businesses, consult or freelance from home, or have chosen alternative, less demanding career paths so that they are more available to their families. Our goal is to support the decisions made by our members. We will never pass judgment on mothers who choose to make or are forced to make different decisions for their families. Our purpose is to foster a nurturing environment where we can share the concerns and challenges of raising children, maintaining our families and ourselves, hoping to create a village of support that extends beyond meetings. Many of us have grown weary being the only black Mom at story time, swim class, etc, we seek to build a community of inclusion to help alleviate the isolation and loneness both stay-at-home and working mothers of color may feel navigating through the adventures of motherhood. Mocha Moms Welcomes people of all religions, races, educational backgrounds and income levels. Mocha Moms, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. Mocha Moms, Inc. does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic level, education, or religion. Anyone who supports the mission and purpose of Mocha Moms, Inc. is welcome to join. For the detailed national mission statement and anti-discrimination language see the national website: www.mochamoms.org Our National History Mocha Moms, Inc. began with the publishing of a newsletter called Mocha Moms in the hopes of connecting at-home mothers of color with each other. The newsletter was intended to encourage these mothers to feel good about their choice as well as to provide information to help them be the best and most important influence in their children\u2019s lives. It was distributed to over 100 moms across the country in the spring of 1997. During the summer of 1997, moms in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland decided to form a support group called Mocha Moms, Inc. There are now over 100 chapters of Mocha Moms, Inc. throughout the United States and the organization is continually growing and evolving to meet the needs of our moms, their families, and the communities they live in.<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":106059822,"name":"Queens Mocha Mom","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/highres_170373162.jpeg","photo_id":170373162,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/member_170373162.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/thumb_170373162.jpeg"}},"members":124,"name":"Mocha Moms Queens Chapter","id":9911592,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mocha-Moms-Queens-Chapter","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Mocha Moms"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377124956000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"baking","name":"Baking","id":15718},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"catering","name":"CATERING","id":18885},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301},{"urlkey":"cooking-dinner-parties","name":"Cooking Dinner Parties","id":21684},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"business-to-business-marketing","name":"Business to Business Marketing","id":26160},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792},{"urlkey":"small-and-home-based-business-marketing","name":"Small and Home-Based Business Marketing","id":84594},{"urlkey":"work-on-your-business-vs-working-in-your-business","name":"Work On your Business VS.

Our goal is to answer (or approximately answer) a well-crafted question. The group runs as follows: 1) The moderator selects one subject for discussion and a date for the meeting. Subjects can be as ephemeral as \"love,\" \"god,\" and \"purpose,\" or as grounded as \"politics,\" \"environmentalism,\" and \"family.\" 2) At the meetup, people are encouraged to propose a question related to the subject. The moderator will collect all of the questions in a list. 3) The group will then vote on the questions. In the first round of voting, each individual may vote for as many questions as they like. The top three will then go to a second round, where each individual may vote just once. 4) The question with the most votes is then discussed. Often, the discussion starts with a narrowing of the question, as it can be challenging to devise a question that can possibly be answered by a small group in just a couple of hours' discussion. If you have a subject you'd like to discuss, feel free to tell the moderator. A list of subjects will be kept and selected from at random each month. One final note: there is no obligation to engage in the discussion. While we encourage everyone to speak if they have something to say, we also welcome those who would rather just observe and learn from others.

From our traderoom in Midtown Manhattan we gather traders with a myriad of methodologies and perspectives to help (1) those now trading enhance their processes and results, and (2) those starting out develop a core trading methodology. In the months ahead we will develop extensions to regular live meet-ups through a free, online trading community to permit members to share ideas, charts, engage in discussions, deal with the ups and downs of this business, overcome inertia in getting off the ground, and other subjects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For those bouncing from one approach to another, looking at dozens of webinars and being bombarded by miracle systems in emails, getting started is daunting. Besides regular monthly in-person gatherings, we will have a free extension to let people share what they're doing, which can act as a trigger for aspiring traders to identify trade-styles and methods that resonate for them. Trading isn't one-size-fits-all. <\/p>\n<p>Those who are progressing are always looking to continue their advancement. Trading is a journey and an evolution. For those of you comfortable with your progress, you know there's always something new to learn and no part of your process is ever perfect. Sometimes your progress stalls. Talking to the right person or hearing about something someone else is doing that resonates for you can be the catalyst for another leap forward. Maybe it's the force that spurs your advancement and makes you (more) profitable. <br><\/p>\n<p><i><b>\u2022 Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT THE ORGANIZER <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I'm Mitch Firestone, a full-time trader here in NYC. I live in Chelsea and work out of a traderoom in Midtown West. I have stepped up to become the new organizer of NYCTTT so want to introduce myself.<\/p>\n<p>I've been trading successfully for a living for 3+ years, supporting myself and my family 100% through trading: (1) day- and swing-trading equities (2) options and (3) intraday futures. Now three years into being fully confident in my individual trading, I started coaching aspiring and intermediate traders about 18 months ago, and in the last six months decided to become involved in the trading \u201ccommunity.\u201d This includes hosting meet-ups, a graduate group where I received my trading education, as well developing Precision Trading Laboratories, a trading-connected business with my friend and business partner Ryan here in the traderoom.<\/p>\n<p>I'm currently a co-organizer in another NYC trading meet-up I'm quite proud of, but when I saw NYCTTT was dormant I decided to step up. I've got some ideas about shepherding a trading meet-up that's not only a stand-alone monthly meeting, but also a trading community that will benefit all involved.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Why do this?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I have a passion for trading and the markets. I enjoy talking about them and interacting with others with the same passion.<\/p>\n<p>I remember how I felt when I was trying to find my way. To help others through this always makes me feel good. Seeing the light-bulb go off over someone's head or getting a phone call about how someone's P&amp;L has gone green is gratifying and fun. I was recently at a trading social function with a successful student of mine and hearing him glowingly describe me as his mentor was a great feeling.<\/p>\n<p>I am always learning from others. Putting together a group of intermediate and advanced traders and committed, dedicated beginners can be a fantastic mix if correctly done. <\/p>\n<p>The act of teaching and preparing for presentations forces me to constantly evaluate my process and makes be better able to react, analyze and explain trading scenarios. This makes me sharper, more knowledgeable, and makes me a better trader. With the reboot of NYCTTT, those in the group who present their knowledge and lead discussions will find the same benefits.<\/p>\n<p>I love trading. Having said that, for many it's a solitary endeavor, which led me to the traderoom. Little did I know that not only would it be socially better, but it accelerated my progress. While I was successful with stocks and options, I was less so with futures. That all changed sitting next to my buddy Ryan here for six months. That sort of effect can arise within this group with the right structure, an extension of the group now being worked on, and interest and commitment from our members.<\/p>\n<p>I've got some ideas about turning this meet-up into a living trading community and I'd love to work with interested members to get this off the ground. As I said, I work out of a traderoom in Midtown West that can host this group early weekday evenings, and have some thoughts about how to extend the group beyond the in-person meet-up..<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<i><b>Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/highres_438749520.jpeg","photo_id":438749520,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/600_438749520.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/thumb_438749520.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":43499082,"name":"Mitch Firestone","photo":{"photo_id":48558332,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/9\/c\/member_48558332.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/9\/c\/thumb_48558332.jpeg"}},"members":407,"name":"NYC Technical Trader Talks","id":10010282,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Technical-Trader-Talks","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Traders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377713794000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"homeschool","name":"Homeschooling","id":603},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"working-parents","name":"Working Parents","id":15786},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"school","name":"School","id":17017},{"urlkey":"school-age-children","name":"School-Age Kids","id":17705},{"urlkey":"public-school","name":"Public School","id":20182},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"middle-school","name":"Middle School","id":72327},{"urlkey":"high-school","name":"High School","id":101296},{"urlkey":"nyc-parents","name":"NYC parents","id":164729},{"urlkey":"middle-school-parents","name":"middle school parents","id":426582}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-High-School-Admissions-101\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is dedicated to providing support and resources for families thinking about or going through NYC high school admissions.

It's all about energy \u2014 Inner Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it. And classes are always free.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026<br>\n\n \u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships<br>\n\n \u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities<br>\n\n \u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt<br>\n\n \u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>What is Sahaja Meditation?<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Inner Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>How does energy flow work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Inner Energy flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your Inner Energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your Inner Energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to fall into the state of meditation, rather than having to perform meditation, as is the case with many forms of meditation. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness \u2014 mental silence \u2014 is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Recent studies conducted by Dr. Ramesh Manocha suggest that thoughtless awareness or mental silence has more impact, experientially and physiologically, than simple relaxation or generic meditation. Sahaja Meditation's mental silence approach to meditation, when compared to a \u201cnon-mental silence\u201d approach, was shown to be, on average, twice as effective in reducing work-related stress, general depressive symptoms and anxiety. Sahaja is much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. If you choose to explore it in depth, it can be a transformative path to achieving your highest potential, reaching a higher plane of knowledge and awareness, and living in peace and contentment.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Physical and emotional health and well-being<\/strong><br>\n\n Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the mental and physical health benefits provided by regular practice of Sahaja. For example:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u2022 Stress management and emotional resilience. Stress, in one way or another, contributes to all mental and physical health problems. The sense of inner calm you experience during thoughtless awareness boosts your emotional resilience, which helps you effectively cope with stressful events in the future. Regular meditation activates a built-in stress management mechanism that helps your cope with stressors on an ongoing basis. Thoughtless awareness enables you to influence your Inner Energy; in other words, influence your central nervous system to heal and improve yourself.<br>\n\n \u2022 Depression and anxiety relief. Sahaja Meditation helps relieve depression and anxiety symptoms and has been shown to increase positive emotions by influencing neurochemicals released by the limbic (emotional) system (e.g., beta-endorphins). Sahaja revitalizes energy and restores optimism, peace and contentment. Meditation helps manage anger, relieve fear and anxiety, erase negative thoughts and feelings, improve self-esteem, and restore a sense of balance, self-control and well-being. You're better equipped to confront and solve your problems, rather than just feel guilty about your mistakes.<br>\n\n \u2022 Prevention and treatment of illnesses, including: epilepsy, hypertension and cardiac diseases, asthma and respiratory illnesses, migraine syndrome, and menopausal symptoms<br>\n\n \u2022 Structurally alters the brain. A recent study at Massachusetts General Hospital, (Harvard Medical School teaching hospital), showed that the regular practice of meditation may produce structural changes in areas of the brain associated with attention and sensory processing.<br>\n\n \u2022 Boosts immune system and slows aging. By improving overall health, Sahaja helps your body manufacture more disease-fighting cells (T-cells). Thoughtless awareness, combined with the ongoing nourishent of Inner Energy, helps slow aging by keeping your mind and body revitalized and rejuvenated. The Mass General study also showed that meditation may help slow aging by reducing thinning of the cortex.<br>\n\n \u2022 Reduction of Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder symptoms, such as attention deficit problems, impulsiveness, hyperactivity and conflict in interpersonal relationships in all settings (school, workplace, social and family). Family-oriented AD\/HD studies of meditation have also shown that parents reported feeling happier, less stressed and better able to manage their child\u2019s behavior.<br>\n\n \u2022 Pain reduction. NIH-funded neuroimaging studies found that long-term meditation can mitigate the brain's response to pain by 40 to 50 percent. In other words, meditation is actually capable of modifying how the brain perceives pain, which could be good news for chronic pain sufferers.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It's important to mention that treatment or cure is a coincidental benefit of Sahaja Meditation \u2014 a wonderful byproduct \u2014 not Sahaja's ultimate goal. Healing is not Sahaja's core objective, nor was Sahaja Meditation intended to be a formal system of treatments for diseases and disorders. Having said that, healing \u2014 and long-term wellness \u2014 begins with harnessing your own untapped energy. So at the very least, Sahaja Meditation is a great place to start.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Personal Development, Self-Actualization, Personality and Relationships<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation increases self-awareness, intuition and introspectiveness \u2014 all qualities that improve your communication skills and increase your compassion and empathy for others. Once you've awakened your Inner Energy through meditation, your attention turns inward \u2014 deep inside yourself, to your own energy centers. Through your own internal process of self-awareness and self-realization, your sensitivity to the feelings of others feelings automatically increases and it becomes easier to put yourself in someone else's shoes. You're better able to visualize and understand how others might feel or anticipate someone's reactions to your own words and deeds.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You begin to focus more on how to improve yourself. You focus on self-improvement through introspection and self-examination, rather than seeking solutions externally through other people, situations, or circumstances. This alone brings about powerful personality changes and builds a foundation for positive interactions with others and strong, pure relationships. The people around you quickly notice your improved attitude, and that you are surrounded by an aura of peace and contentment. You become peaceful from within. As meditation continues to nourish your energy centers over time, people find you to be pleasant to be around and view you as someone who has valuable advice to offer.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation techniques can teach you to gauge the state of your own energy centers and become adept at pinpointing the location of blockages (known as 'catches'). Each energy center is associated with a set of qualities. So a problem in an energy center means a problem with the quality associated with that center.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You'll have live and constant feedback of what's going on with your mind and body \u2014 a powerful self-diagnostic tool that allows you to quickly pinpoint and solve problems. Sahaja helps you analyze your own feelings \u2014 whether positive or negative \u2014 and determine what's triggering them. Negative emotions fade (e.g., feeling guilty for past mistakes) and the trajectory of your life becomes an ascending spiral.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>The spiritual face of Sahaja Meditation<\/strong><br>\n\n For those who choose to explore its depths, Sahaja Meditation can deliver benefits on two powerful dimensions: (1) the rejuvenating experiential aspect and true improvement of oneself and; (2) growth and understanding of spiritual knowledge. Regular practice of Sahaja Meditation can illuminate the true meaning of spirituality and what the journey of spirituality can mean in your life, not tethered to any religion or \"rules.\" The ability to influence the subtle energy system is a thoroughly modern solution with origins revealed in ancient scriptures more than 14,000 years ago. Sahaja can open up a whole world of knowledge known to very few. Attempting to fully articulate the Sahaja spiritual experience is like trying to describe the magnificent beauty of the ocean floor in all its living, miraculous complexity to someone who's standing on the shore, asking what lies beneath the surface of the ocean. No matter how hard you try to describe what can be found in the depths of the ocean, it can only be truly experienced if you dive to those depths yourself.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>What to expect from a Sahaja Meditation class<\/strong><br>\n\n First, all classes are free, no strings attached. There's nothing to buy, now or ever. It's against Sahaja principles to charge money for helping others awaken the energy that we were all born with. Sahaja instructors feel that spirituality should not be equated with money and commerce.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>And Sahaja Meditation is a \"family practice.\"<\/strong> We welcome all ages. Walk-ins are welcome.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Overview. The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness or mental silence. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And I'm always available to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n About our sessions. Classes are conducted in a peaceful environment; soothing background music helps facilitate meditation. Meditations are guided by instructors and are designed to accommodate the collective experience. Individual assistance (both beginner and advanced) is always available. While the actual practice of meditation forms the core of our sessions, sessions may also include discussions of, for example, specific aspects of the subtle energy system. But it's not all \"serious.\" There's also plenty of opportunity to enjoy casual conversations and share experiences with others.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The power of collective meditation. Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Once you have awakened your Inner Energy, you may find that the benefits of meditation are compounded when you meditate in a group of people who are \"on the same frequency;\" i.e., connecting to the collective universal energy at the same time and place. Think of it as a network of computer servers linked to each other\u2026 each can access and share resources of the other, and as a group, they form a powerful network of resources. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meditating at home. You can meditate anytime in any quiet environment. Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, the technique simply involves easing into the state of meditation to raise the energy, then gradually easing out of it to carry on with your day. You're likely to find your solo meditations to be much more beneficial if you have first attended a class where expert Sahaja practitioners are on hand to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n What Sahaja Meditation holds in store for you, personally, is up to you. You can devote as much time to it or as little as you wish. But like everything else in life, the benefits you reap will generally be commensurate with the amount of time and effort you invest. As with a physical fitness program, for example, you must have knowledge and understanding of the techniques, as well as the motivation and maturity to pursue the fitness routine. You must enter into the experience with an open mind, a belief that it can work and a willingness to work, or the program won't achieve a high level of success. And as with any physical fitness program you undertake, meditation results may vary, depending on variables such as how fit you are when you begin the program and how hard you work on an ongoing basis. But typically, two 10 to 15-minute-sessions per day will yield significant benefits.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Contact us at 973-506-9515 or send us a message for any questions.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Visit www.sahajameditation.com, www.sahajameditationbenefits.com for more details.<\/p>","lon":-74.3799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/highres_277668272.jpeg","photo_id":277668272,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/600_277668272.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_277668272.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12407024,"name":"Nirmal K Mukhi"},"members":130,"name":"The Morris County Sahaja Meditation Group","id":10049382,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Morris-County-Meditation","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Meditation Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377987030000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"ria","name":"Rich Internet Applications","id":9886},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"ext-js","name":"Ext JS","id":70707},{"urlkey":"mobile-web","name":"Mobile Web","id":78586},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951},{"urlkey":"sencha-touch","name":"Sencha Touch","id":116642},{"urlkey":"sencha-ext-js","name":"Sencha Ext JS","id":116856},{"urlkey":"sencha","name":"Sencha","id":129312},{"urlkey":"cross-platform-mobile","name":"Cross-platform Mobile","id":846132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Sencha-Users\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>The purpose of this group is to bring smart people together and learn how to develop amazing apps with Ext JS and Sencha Touch.

(ABSC), formerly known as the American Buddhist Academy, was founded in 1951 by the late Reverend Hozen Seki as a Buddhist cultural center. Rev. Seki sought to provide a Buddhist study center for people interested in learning more about the Buddhist teachings with particular emphasis toward Shin Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>The Center is located on Riverside Drive near 105th Street on the upper West Side of New York City immediately adjacent to the New York Buddhist Temple. It is within walking distance to many of New York\u2019s finest schools and universities including Columbia, Barnard, Manhattan College, City College, NYU and theological seminaries.<\/p>\n<p>ABSC runs a full schedule of Buddhist programs and events throughout the year. From lecturer series, workshops, book discussion groups to afternoon movie series. Besides these activities the Center also publishes the Natural Way newsletter, booklets and other publications.<\/p>\n<p>The crown jewel of the center is its Buddhist reference and research library. There are over ten thousand volumes of Buddhist texts, manuscripts, and sutras. Many in the ABSC collection are very rare and priceless. There are books on Tibet Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Shin and Zen Buddhism. ABSC has one of the best Buddhist collections of Shin Buddhist works on the East Coast.<\/p>\n<p>Through the years many famous Buddhist scholars have given lectures and workshops at the center. One of the most notable was D.T. Suzuki, who in 1958 gave a series of lectures that were published by Harper and Row entitled Shin Buddhism, in 1970. Then a second edition was later published by Shambhala in a new introduction by Taitetsu Unno, entitled Buddha of Infinite Light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shinran Shonin Statue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today in front of the New York Buddhist Church stands a fifteen foot high bronze statue of Shinran Shonin, the founder of Shin Buddhism. This statue was a generous gift from Mr. Hirose, a Japanese industrialist, to the American Buddhist Academy. During WWII the Shinran Shonin statue stood in front of a Buddhist temple in Hiroshima. As metals became scarce in Japan many bronze statues and ornaments were melted down to be used for the war effort. The Shinran Shonin statue survived, while other Buddhist and religious ornaments were not so lucky. Then on August 6, 1946, the Shinran Shonin statue withstood its greatest test by surviving the Atomic bomb blast over Hiroshima. After the war Mr. Hirose wanted this statue to represent world peace, and Rev. Seki convinced Mr. Hirose to ship it to New York City, the crossroads of the world. On September 11, 1955, the statue was unveiled in the courtyard of the American Buddhist Academy. There D.T. Suzuki gave his key note address for world peace and harmony. This year, 2008 marks the 53rd anniversary of the occasion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Shin Buddhism, also known as Jodo Shinshu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most important realization for Shin Buddhists is the attainment of shinjin, which occurs in our present life. Shinjin is true entrusting in the Immeasurable Life and Light of the compassionate Amida Buddha and the Primal Vow. This spiritual transformation takes place in our present life, not after death. We become aware of the oneness with all life surrounding us through our deepened understanding of the basic tenets of Buddhism, which include the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold paths, dependent origination, and impermanence. For the Shin Buddhist to realize this oneness is due to the working of Other Power, which is none other then Amida\u2019s Primal Vow. It is within this Vow that we take notice of our intimate interconnectedness with others and with all life. As Shinran Shonin wrote in 1250 \u201cThus, when we simply let the karmic retribution of whatever good or evil we might have play itself out, and we turn to believe solely in the true vow, that is other power.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span>The New York Buddhist Church (NYBC) is a temple of Jodoshinshu True Pure Land School Buddhism, whose head temple is Nishi-Hongwanji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. Shinran Shonin (1173-1262) is the founder of this school of Buddhism.<\/span> <br> <br> <span>The NYBC has been serving the New York community since 1938, and was founded by Rev. Hozen Seki with the assistance of his wife, Satomi, and concerned lay people. They all wished to share the Buddha-Dharma in America's most populous city, which then had no center for Jodoshinshu Buddhism.

Although it is a fast and energetic dance, it flows smoothly and the moves are continuous and rhythmic, and dancers follow circular movements as they relate to each other. One way in which the present Porto-Seguro style differs from the orig<span>inal Kaoma-like Lambada style, is that the they have removed wiggling shoulder movements (also sometimes seen in Cuban-style salsa). Instead the shoulders are kept fixed while the hips move (swing) to create a sensual effect. A number of movements have been added to the modern version of this dance (many created by Didi Santos of Brazil). Porto Seguro style is so prominent in Lambazouk that the two are often considered synonymous, not to mention, even the most celebrated Porto Seguro dancers call themselves Lambazouk dancers.<br>\n\nLambazouk is characterized by the following movements:<br>\n\n<br>\n\nCabe\u00e7a.<br>\n\nBoneca.<br>\n\nChicote.<br>\n\nCambre.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is danced to rhythmic, up-tempo music (tempo is generally fast or medium, rarely slow). Kizomba music is very popular in Lambazouk owing to its rhythm and pace. Because the music faster, and head movements are more sophisticated and done more often, dancing Lambazouk requires better technique and timing in order to perform head movements without injuries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is mainly danced in Porto Seguro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Argentina, Spain, Israel, UK, US, Israel, Japan &amp; recently also in Malaysia. LambaZouk is also evolving to include more modern movements. It is also not uncommon (lately) for dancers to switch fluently between these dancing styles during a single Zouk music song.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/highres_348498322.jpeg","photo_id":348498322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/600_348498322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/thumb_348498322.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8379582,"name":"Hisa","photo":{"photo_id":144664942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/4\/e\/member_144664942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/4\/e\/thumb_144664942.jpeg"}},"members":134,"name":"Dan\u00e7a Brasil, Lambazouk, Samba e Forro","id":10135062,"state":"NY","urlname":"Danca-Brasileira-Zouk-Lambada-Samba-e-Forro","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378477302000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"local-filmmakers","name":"Local Filmmakers","id":22984},{"urlkey":"gorilla-filmmaking-film-shorts-for-film-festivals","name":"Gorilla filmmaking, Film shorts for Film Festivals","id":26000},{"urlkey":"film-makers","name":"Filmmaking","id":31082},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"online-filmmaking","name":"Online Filmmaking","id":64061},{"urlkey":"micro-budget-filmmaking","name":"Micro Budget Filmmaking","id":76190},{"urlkey":"allowing-filmmakers-to-improve-their-skills","name":"Allowing Filmmakers to Improve their Skills","id":78403},{"urlkey":"low-budget-filmmaking","name":"Low Budget Filmmaking","id":124947},{"urlkey":"indie-filmmaking","name":"Indie Filmmaking","id":152559},{"urlkey":"guerilla-filmmaking","name":"Guerilla Filmmaking","id":249101},{"urlkey":"filmmaking-network","name":"filmmaking network","id":640022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Zorkas-Creatives\/","rating":3.75,"description":"<p>Our group is dedicated to helping new creatives take that first step in creating a career in film and photography.

That being said, we might look into some 5K's for fun... but that will be optional for whichever members are interested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Also, I encourage members to take the lead and schedule runs so we can cover different neighborhoods, fitness levels, and schedules.

FEMA, PSE&amp;G and other institutions eventually reached the city to restore basic services. But our telecommunications companies were overwhelmed and unable to respond effectively in the face of unprecedented infrastructure failures. As a result, Hoboken residents and businesses had a very difficult time communicating with each other, with our local government, and with friends and family outside our community. We can't let Hoboken go off the grid like this again. And we can't wait for Verizon or Cablevision to harden their systems. Despite repeated calls from Congress and the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry is resisting new requirements for backup power for cell sites and other critical communications facilities. We have to fix this problem ourselves so that our community is prepared for the next big crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A new technology called mesh wireless networking offers a fast, relatively inexpensive way to quickly build an open, free, redundant local network in Hoboken.

As many of you have probably experienced, the value-add of most startup events is minimal. The quality of talks and panels is low, but it is even worse when it comes to networking opportunities made available by these events. A chosen few get all the attention while rest of the attendees do nothing more than exchange business cards.\u00a0<span>Our goal is to provide a level playing field to everyone because it is our belief that you learn more from people who are \"in the same boat\" rather than from superstars who have \"been there, done that\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We want to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, providers and others from the startup ecosystem. Together, we will build a community that is completely focused on providing high-value to # STARTUP members. We may restrict access or organize invite-only events (based on member relevance to certain events) to ensure quality of our events and conferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are dedicated to building the best startup network in the world.<\/span> But, w<span>e will not grow our network at the expense of diluting value to our members.<\/span> Our long-term mission is to build local chapters that organize events and conferences in every major city across the world.

We welcome all levels of coders - professionals and students - and we are committed to helping developers be successful with their smartphone and tablet apps.<\/p>\n<p>What we cover:<\/p>\n<ul> \n <p>Anything that has to do with building a Windows Phone or Windows 8.x app: deep dives into app models, specific SDKs, libraries, tips &amp; tricks, etc.<\/p> \n <p>Game development for the Windows Platform using Unity, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA\/MonoGame, C++\/DirectX, etc.<\/p> \n <p>Microsoft&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;for app developers, Azure Mobile Services, back-end data stores, Dev Ops, etc.<\/p> \n <p>Publishing your apps &amp; games in the store, App Monetization,&nbsp;Advertising &amp;&nbsp;Marketing.<\/p> \n <p>Windows platform apps and the Internet of Things (IoT), and also Kinect&nbsp;&amp; HoloLens.<\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<p>All&nbsp;members who attend the monthly Meetup can win raffle prizes from our sponsors such as Xbox games, books on mobile development from O'Reilly and&nbsp;Microsoft Press.

I found that time and time again, people not knowing how to use the various features of their cameras is what holds back their progress. Spend some time learning how to manually control your camera, it is time well spent. Also do a little planning and prep work before coming to the meetup, it will help you take better pictures. <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/f\/600_435361055.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>(Photos above were taken during our Light-painting meetup events in 2014) <br><\/p>\n<p>Some forms of photography require two people or more people working the equipment behind the scenes to effectively pull off a shot such as in the lightpainting shots above. A camera that can be controlled using manual settings and a sturdy tripod are the most basic pieces of equipment you will need for this group. All the photos shown on this page were taken using long exposure and sturdy tripods. (Below - HDR of Eiffel Tower at twilight, using bracketed 2 - 8 second time exposures)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/5\/6\/event_296060822.jpeg\" height=\"162\" width=\"239\"><\/p>\n<p>Although not required, sometimes, additional equipment is needed such as&nbsp; flashlight(s), flash(s), wireless triggers, etc... for our light painting or off camera flash events (depending what you want to do). <br><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I really encourage you to learn the software that has changed the way we develop photos. Probably the #1 program that has helped photographers make amazing shots is Adobe Photoshop. If you haven't learned it yet, I suggest you spend some time with this amazing program. I also encourage you to learn Lightroom. There are also many free programs available that one can learn to help achieve the effect you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>So bring what equipment you have as well as a open mind let's make some cool photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a great idea for an unusal photo, either make a comment on the group page or come to our group meeting and let us know, we may choose to make it a group project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Experimental-Photography\/pages\/Membership_Policy_and_Liability_Waiver\/\">Click here to see Membership policies<\/a> in order to join.<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/highres_438563205.jpeg","photo_id":438563205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/600_438563205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/thumb_438563205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4556764,"name":"Patrick","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/highres_246147481.jpeg","photo_id":246147481,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/member_246147481.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/thumb_246147481.jpeg"}},"members":135,"name":"NYC Experimental Photography","id":10755002,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Experimental-Photography","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Experimental Photographers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382239179000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"expat","name":"Expat","id":4446},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HIFgroup\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>Did you move to Hoboken from another country?

While instrumental music of all kinds is well represented in New York concerts, it is rare that electroacoustic music is heard, and often works are not presented in the kind of ambience that they need. In order to improve this situation, we have organized large festivals of electroacoustic music in 2009, 2010, and 2013 (http:\/\/www.nycemf.org).

In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>I very intentionally use the word&nbsp;\u201cmedicine\u201d&nbsp;when I speak about sacred plants.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;because&nbsp;in my opinion this work deserves reverence and respect.&nbsp; We engage this work&nbsp;consciously and with awareness of the profound changes we are making, not just in our own lives, but in the lives of those around us.&nbsp; When we invite the sacred plants into our lives, we do so so we can learn from them, grow with them, and from their divine wisdom, encounter the wisdom alive within each of us. &nbsp; <br>I do not support the plants&nbsp;being used recreationally, to&nbsp;\u201cget high\u201d or have&nbsp;\u201ca trip\u201d, nor do I support the plants being administered by anyone who does not have proper training,&nbsp;experience, and intention. <br><\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life.&nbsp; <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose.&nbsp; <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops.&nbsp; <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns.&nbsp; <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have.&nbsp; <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies.&nbsp; <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing.&nbsp; <br>-Access to virtual and live events <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners.&nbsp; <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products.&nbsp; <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/1\/highres_446907569.jpeg","photo_id":446907569,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/1\/600_446907569.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/b\/1\/thumb_446907569.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":2845,"name":"Sacred Plants NYC","id":10833812,"state":"NY","urlname":"sacredplantsnyc","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Journeyers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382728937000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"magic-the-gathering","name":"Magic the Gathering","id":25717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Startup-Nerds-Gather-for-Magic\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Private group for cool people and their friends that work for technology companies in NYC to play MTG.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12527772,"name":"Aditya Mukerjee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/3\/0\/highres_51151792.jpeg","photo_id":51151792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/3\/0\/member_51151792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/3\/0\/thumb_51151792.jpeg"}},"members":64,"name":"NYC Internet People Play Magic","id":10841252,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Startup-Nerds-Gather-for-Magic","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"gatherers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382794976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dogtraining","name":"Dog Training","id":10024},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-behavioral-training","name":"Dog Behavioral Training","id":35157},{"urlkey":"helping-reactive-rescue-dogs","name":"Helping Reactive, Rescue Dogs","id":38430},{"urlkey":"linking-with-other-dog-owners","name":"Linking with other Dog Owners","id":46918},{"urlkey":"dog-obedience-and-behavioral-training","name":"Dog Obedience and Behavioral Training","id":49853},{"urlkey":"dog-owners","name":"Dog Owners","id":55535},{"urlkey":"dog-behavior-and-training","name":"Dog Behavior and Training","id":91169},{"urlkey":"dog-obedience-training-and-problem-solving","name":"Dog Obedience Training and Problem Solving","id":116266},{"urlkey":"helping-rescue-dogs-become-pets","name":"Helping Rescue Dogs Become Pets","id":154507},{"urlkey":"shelter-and-rescue-dogs","name":"Shelter and Rescue Dogs","id":158992},{"urlkey":"understanding-dogs","name":"understanding dogs","id":414532},{"urlkey":"canine-behavior-science-positive-reinforcement","name":"canine behavior science - positive reinforcement","id":766802}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rescue-Dog-Owners-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"Rescue dogs are amazing animals.

The highlight of the meeting is a 30-minute session in which each poet writes a fresh, original poem on the spot. At the end of the meeting, members read their newly written poems aloud. They also have the option to publish their poems on our website at http:\/\/www.thepoetrytable.com.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/highres_422424842.jpeg","photo_id":422424842,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/600_422424842.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/0\/a\/thumb_422424842.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105761092,"name":"Rosalind Resnick","photo":{"photo_id":157193162,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/a\/a\/member_157193162.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/a\/a\/thumb_157193162.jpeg"}},"members":439,"name":"The Poetry Table","id":10994752,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Poetry-Table","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Poets"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1383780115000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"mapreduce","name":"MapReduce","id":27591},{"urlkey":"nosql","name":"NoSQL","id":58162},{"urlkey":"hive","name":"Hive","id":61679},{"urlkey":"hbase","name":"HBase","id":61680},{"urlkey":"using-hadoop-in-the-cloud","name":"Using Hadoop in the cloud","id":140255},{"urlkey":"impala","name":"Impala","id":146292},{"urlkey":"open-source-analytics","name":"Open Source Analytics","id":773382},{"urlkey":"apache-hbase","name":"APache HBase","id":1116052},{"urlkey":"cloudera","name":"Cloudera","id":1247352},{"urlkey":"hadoop-analytics","name":"Hadoop Analytics","id":1368642},{"urlkey":"hadoop-integration","name":"Hadoop Integration","id":1420902}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Cloudera-User-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for Cloudera customers in the New York tri-state area to network, share best practices, and exchange ideas around the Cloudera Big Data platform and components including Cloudera Impala, Cloudera Manager, Cloudera Navigator, HBase, and so on.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/highres_436304130.jpeg","photo_id":436304130,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/600_436304130.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/6\/2\/thumb_436304130.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":118766022,"name":"Cloudera User Groups","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/b\/7\/highres_244146839.jpeg","photo_id":244146839,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/b\/7\/member_244146839.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/b\/7\/thumb_244146839.jpeg"}},"members":263,"name":"NY Cloudera User Group","id":11000382,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Cloudera-User-Group","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Cuggers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1383795043000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"skiing","name":"Skiing","id":2294},{"urlkey":"snowboard","name":"Snowboarding","id":3425},{"urlkey":"ccskiing","name":"Cross-Country Skiing","id":3490},{"urlkey":"cross-country-skiing","name":"Cross Country Skiing","id":52821},{"urlkey":"skiers","name":"Skiers","id":65097}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Ski-Gypsies\/","rating":0,"description":"The New York City Ski Gypsies is a club focused on local skiing and are typically people who also share the same passion for scuba diving and ocean conservation.

Every person has this relationship. We need to explore this relationship, and make that exploration something that is a life-long priority. We identify with our bodies, but we are not our body. Similarly, we identify with our culture, language, religions, but we are not any of these things either. Our true story is the story of our real identity. We need to find what and who that is. Just as we have duties to our family, and within the work-sphere, at the same time we also have to do what is necessary to understand where reality is, and who we are in that reality. That, in fact, is our primary duty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A zikr recitation follows every talk and all are invited to join in.<\/p>\n<p>These talks will be given at the New York Open Center, 22 East 30th Street, New York, New York 10016.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All are welcome to attend, and there is no admission charge.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>(Required statement: We are not sponsored by The Open Center)<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/d\/8\/highres_311450392.jpeg","photo_id":311450392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/d\/8\/600_311450392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/d\/8\/thumb_311450392.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":120576532,"name":"Musa Muhaiyaddeen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/c\/8\/highres_159653192.jpeg","photo_id":159653192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/c\/8\/member_159653192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/c\/8\/thumb_159653192.jpeg"}},"members":148,"name":"Sufi Study Center","id":11160092,"state":"NY","urlname":"Discourses-on-the-Mystical-Path-of-Sufism-at-The-Open-Center","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1384916285000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"xbox","name":"Xbox","id":245},{"urlkey":"soccer","name":"Soccer","id":947},{"urlkey":"basketball","name":"Basketball","id":3597},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"bar-games","name":"Bar Games","id":43026},{"urlkey":"madden-league","name":"Madden League","id":48304},{"urlkey":"nba-basketball","name":"NBA Basketball","id":52933},{"urlkey":"fifa","name":"FIFA","id":55105},{"urlkey":"adult-sports-league","name":"Adult Sports League","id":59874},{"urlkey":"competitive-gaming","name":"Competitive Gaming","id":67970},{"urlkey":"fifa-world-cup","name":"FIFA World Cup","id":102372},{"urlkey":"video-game-tournaments","name":"Video Game Tournaments","id":107047},{"urlkey":"xbox-one","name":"Xbox One","id":1446332},{"urlkey":"fifa-tournaments","name":"FIFA Tournaments","id":1504178}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/playerslounge\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>If you think you're unbeatable at your favorite sports game, this group is here for you to test your skills against those who think just like you.

Not part-time, not as a hobby, not as a source of quick \"money on the side\" with several months in between doing something else. It's our full-time job, or truly augments it (for example, some talented individuals do equal amounts of stage\/film\/TV as well as VO work ).

We have a large email list, completely separate from this website, and get about 5 to 10 people per meeting just from that.<span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Anyway, most importantly, this group is commitment-free. Some of our members attend nearly every meeting; others show up once a month or even once a year. The main rule is to bring something to work on for the first hour. No assignments. No prompts. It's just a solid chunk of quiet time that you can use however you want. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> After the writing, there's a short break, and then we gather a little closer to take turns introducing ourselves. After that, we spend another hour or so doing an informal reading of our work. No one is ever forced to read -- that's not our style -- so at any given meeting, about half the people might end up sharing something. Some people read stuff they've been working on for a while. Others read what they've written during the hour. There's n<\/span><\/span>o need to bring copies because we read aloud. Each person gets eight minutes, which includes time for others to offer feedback, so we keep things moving at a pretty good pace.&nbsp;<span><br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> People in this group have written and shared all kinds of stuff:&nbsp;novels,&nbsp;short stories,&nbsp;journal and diary entries,&nbsp;poems,&nbsp;personal essays,&nbsp;memoirs, plays, screenplays,&nbsp;articles, dialogues, outlines, limericks, newsletters, blogs, kids books, science fiction, erotica, comedy, book proposals, cartoon strips, horoscopes, wedding speeches, eulogies, and song lyrics. Anything goes, and the same is true for your writing experience. You don't have to be published or submit samples in order to join. The purpose is to have a varied crowd and a relaxed setting where we actually do some writing and have a chance to hang out and meet fellow writers, and since people often ask, we're mostly in our 20s and 30s. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> We get together every week or two. There's no regular location because we usually meet in people's homes all over the place. (If you can host, please speak up!) Twice a year, we meet at a big, antiquarian bookstore in midtown. In warmer months, we meet semi-regularly in Central Park and other outdoor spots. We've even taken a few road trips as a group,&nbsp;<\/span>but we almost always stay within MetroCard range. Once per month (ish),&nbsp;we meet on weekend afternoons, but we usually do our thing on weeknights from 7:00 until about 10:30pm. People are welcome to show up late or leave early, so don't worry if these times aren't ideal. Can't make it for the writing hour? No problem. Come after that and check out the readings. <span> <br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> <span>We don't have a set schedule. Some people are never free on Mondays, for example, while others can never make it on weekends, so we meet on different days of the week to accommodate everyone.<\/span> <br> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Finally, this group has always been free (and will remain so for people who are already part of it), but because of the cost of advertising on Meetup, there's a suggested donation of $1 -- not per meeting, but just at the first one you attend. <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> That's it.

The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In some cases, actual Phil Lesh bass lines have been transcribed. \u00a0The Grateful Dead, like many bands, shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord\u00a0progressions and song\u00a0forms; the actual chord voicings Jerry used;\u00a0the actual chord voicings Bob used;\u00a0specific chord progressions used during the improv sections;\u00a0pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;\u00a0chord\/scale combinations; Jerry's use of chromaticism; complicated ostinatos; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.\u00a0 This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.\u00a0 However, there is no obligation to improvise.\u00a0 There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.\u00a0 People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. \u00a0In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on over 50 songs including: \u00a0<\/span><span>Alabama Getaway, Bertha, Big River, Birdsong, Black Muddy River, Brown Eyed Women, Casey Jones, China Cat Sunflower, Deal, El Paso, Eyes Of The World, Fire On The Mountain, Franklin's Tower, Friend Of The Devil, Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad, Good Lovin\u2019, I Know You Rider, Jack-A-Roe, Jackstraw, Johnny B.

There's something for everyone at NHOC. Aside from hiking, the club is involved with many activities including camping, walking, horseback riding, bicycling, picnicking, and just about anything which broadens knowledge of and respect for nature. Some members participate in trail maintenance and other conservation efforts. During the winter months, indoor as well as outdoor activities are offered. All hikes and activities are graded on their level of difficulty - from easy (\"C\") to challenging (\"A\"). We are a friendly, social group looking for new members. Many of our members fall into the SINGLES category and there is no better way to find new friends than by participating in an activity that you love. If you decide to become a full paying member of NHOC, you will receive our Shorelines publication several times throughout the year, informing you of all of our activities. We organize 15-30 hikes per month throughout the New York area. Parties, social gatherings, city walks, movie nights, bowling, and weekend trips are only some of the wide range of activities that we plan for our members. Annual dues is only $30 (Individual) or $40 (Family). <\/p>\n<p><b>As a Meetup member, you may join us for 2 hikes before becoming a full paying member of NHOC.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>For more information, here is a link to our website:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nassauhiking.org\">http:\/\/www.nassauhik<\/a>e.org<br> <\/p>\n<p>If you would like to download a membership form:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nassauhike.org\/membership.html\">http:\/\/nassauhike.org\/membership.html<\/a><br><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.6900024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":95948312,"name":"Jill K","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/highres_169588202.jpeg","photo_id":169588202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/member_169588202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_169588202.jpeg"}},"members":659,"name":"Nassau Hiking and Outdoor Club (NHOC)","id":12049682,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nassau-Hiking-and-Outdoor-Club-NHOC","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Hikers, walkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1389548487000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"vegan","name":"Vegan","id":408},{"urlkey":"rawfood","name":"Raw Food","id":1983},{"urlkey":"raw-whole-food-demos","name":"Raw Whole Food Demo's","id":19084},{"urlkey":"plant-based-nutrition","name":"Plant-Based Nutrition","id":19490},{"urlkey":"raw-food-diet","name":"Raw Food Diet","id":19987},{"urlkey":"gluten-free","name":"Gluten-Free","id":24157},{"urlkey":"raw-vegan","name":"Raw Vegan","id":24509},{"urlkey":"raw-potlucks","name":"Raw Potlucks","id":28231},{"urlkey":"raw-food-preparation","name":"Raw Food Preparation","id":29659},{"urlkey":"raw-food-potlucks","name":"Raw Food Potlucks","id":34749},{"urlkey":"raw-food-prep-classes","name":"Raw Food Prep Classes","id":37954},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"detoxification-and-cleansing","name":"Detoxification and Cleansing","id":152623}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Raw-and-Vegan-Food-Potlucks-and-Events\/","rating":4.8,"description":"<p>This is a group to bring anyone interested in raw foods.&nbsp; We are a plant-based (vegan) group focused on maintaining a Raw, Crude and Juicy lifestyle.&nbsp; Crude refers to vegan unprocessed and unrefined, raw is uncooked, and juicy...well I think you get the point ;) <br> <\/p>\n<p>We will have different events to welcome all the Raw, Crude and Juicy crowd.&nbsp; Whether you're vegan, raw, raw-curious, a juicing connoisseur, or if you are interested in taking your health and wellness to the next level - this group is for you!

We welcome everyone to our meetups even if you're not currently a Bitcoin user, but simply want to find out more about this amazing e-currency. See you at the Connecticut Bitcoin Meetup!<\/p>","lon":-73.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/9\/0\/highres_337723152.jpeg","photo_id":337723152,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/9\/0\/600_337723152.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/9\/0\/thumb_337723152.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":20730881,"name":"John Dolan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/d\/a\/highres_224444762.jpeg","photo_id":224444762,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/d\/a\/member_224444762.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/d\/a\/thumb_224444762.jpeg"}},"members":62,"name":"BitcoinCT","id":12867162,"state":"CT","urlname":"BitcoinCT","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Bitcoiner"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1392325114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-without-surgery","name":"Weight Loss Without Surgery","id":16221},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support-and-solutions","name":"Weight Loss Support and Solutions","id":33614},{"urlkey":"healthy-weight-loss","name":"Healthy Weight Loss","id":58776}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-unique-weight-loss-solution\/","rating":0,"description":"I will walk you through your personal weight loss journey.
