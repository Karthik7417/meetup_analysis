What if you could upgrade your thoughts, feelings,habits and future like the apps on your tablet or smartphone? Are you stuck and can't get your life moving faster. What if there are NEW methods to RESET your life like when your smartphone freezes. \"UPGRADE And RESET YOUR LIFE\" provides tools that will make you happier, more passionate about life, more productive on your dreams, and wealthier.

Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, take measurements of habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile. We will take abstract concepts and transform them through the knowledge of neural science and physics into powerful physical tools you can touch.

New Art will allow each person to understand their own \"Specific-Mind\" like a MRI for the mind. The primary emphasis of New Art is developing self-awareness and choices. It becomes easy to literally see your limitations and problems while also seeing powerful solutions no other tools can provide. You will enhance the best of yourself while upgrading your life in ways beyond your dreams. Join this group to start UPGRADING YOUR LIFE each week. You will have fun while making real changes in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each Session members will hold in their hands printed sheets of Art work they will use to record parts of their minds, solve problems, communicate with their minds (different from meditation), record measurements of mental activity. With the Art Work members of the community will be able to show each others what they are working on each week. Personal improvement moves form a philosophical talk to show me your Art work and what you are working on. Members will select projects and goals they will work on as individuals and within the community making possible everything form habit change, weight release, less stress, greater mental focus, solving business problems, removing fears and anxieties, becoming free from shyness, emotional clarity and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>GAIN CLARITY ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IN YOUR BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LIFE<\/p>\n<p>MAKE REAL CHANGES TO YOUR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND ACTIONS<\/p>\n<p>DISCOVER THE HIDDEN ASSETS NEEDED TO BUILD YOUR FUTURE<\/p>\n<p>TRANSFORM YOUR PAST INTO AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF NEW POSSIBILITIES<\/p>\n<p>USE YOUR EMOTIONS AS RESOURCES<\/p>\n<p>YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW TO SET AND ACHIEVE GOALS IN THE REAL WORLD<\/p>\n<p>DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS<\/p>\n<p>EACH SESSION WILL BE WILL BUILD ON THE LAST AND TAKE TO THE NEXT STEP<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105794502,"name":"James Murdock","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/highres_149903682.jpeg","photo_id":149903682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/member_149903682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/thumb_149903682.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"UPGRADE AND RESET YOUR LIFE","id":19154726,"state":"NY","urlname":"UPGRADE-AND-RESET-YOUR-LIFE","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"BRAIN-MIND SETTERS"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Flushing","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448481823000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"tantric","name":"Tantra","id":10146},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"kirtan","name":"Kirtan","id":18868},{"urlkey":"devotional-singing","name":"Devotional Singing","id":21450},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-chanting","name":"Meditation and Chanting","id":82258},{"urlkey":"ananda-marga","name":"Ananda Marga","id":89311},{"urlkey":"vegetarians-and-vegans-vegan-vegetarian-activism","name":"Vegetarians and Vegans & Vegan Vegetarian Activism","id":136597}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Flushing-Ananda-Marga-Meditation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This Meetup provides a venue and scope to experience mantra chanting, learn and practice meditation, and other yogic practices of Ananda Marga.

Events are limited to 4 photographers. Most models seem to prefer 3 photographers. Those events with more than 4 are called paparazzi shoot-outs, they typically cost less. Some events are meet and greets or promotional events.<\/p>\n<p>The models chosen to be on the team have been interviewed and have passed a series of criteria to participate. These models are professional and work well beyond the time behind the camera: They scout locations, contact venues, determine if permits are required or not and obtain them if feasible. Some events require they rent wardrobe or equipment and it doesn't need to be explained that there is a great deal of time doing all of that. This group nor the models do any TFPs... Ever. What's nice is the photographers never have to spend any time editing, copying or distributing pictures to models. That's right. Photographers are not obligated to share their pictures nor are the models expecting any from them. WorldChoiceModels is ideal for:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers that want to do street photography or photowalks with a model. \u2022 Photographers looking to practice their skills, experiment with their equipment or technique.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers looking to expand their portfolios. bridal, senior portraits, couples, fashion, commercial lifestyle, editorial, etc. From time to time there will be workshops on studio lighting, and specific genres.

We are genuine people that care. Genuine people with a background in fitness, athletics &amp; coaching. People who respect the process of becoming fit &amp; all the obstacles along the way. We\u2019re people just like anyone else. We have families of our own. We understand that life is a gentle and tricky balance of caring for oneself as well as our loved ones. Far too often the former gets neglected and we can say that because we\u2019ve been there. We\u2019ve been down that road. Ultimately we decided it was time to make time. Time to make fitness a goal and embrace the truth that is the fragility of life.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>CrossFit is defined as, \u201cConstantly varied functional movements performed at relatively high intensity.\u201d It combines cardiovascular endurance, weightlifting &amp; gymnastics to form the foundation of measurable fitness &amp; health. Often performed in a class &amp; teamwork atmosphere, CrossFit prides itself on community. It\u2019s that very community or team that makes working hard fun. The philosophy, in a nutshell, at Tribute Strength is to get ourselves and our members fit, happy and healthy.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Intrigued? Want to learn more?

My name is Stacy. I grew up in a small town in New Jersey where everyone knew everybody. I dated and married one of my best friends cousins. We had a demolition business together, got married, had a kid. We were together for 15 years. Life presented us with many challenges and ultimately our marriage ended. I went down a spiritual path studying everything from transcendental meditation to Kabbalah. Which led me to move closer to the city. After getting divorced and uprooting my entire life, which included changing careers I found myself in search of like minded people. Thus this Meetup... I'm looking to create something to help those who are in a similar situation and to bring us all together and enjoy our new endeavors in life.

Some events are local in New York City and New Jersey with dinner while others are day trip events with buses commuting from the five boroughs to dinner halls then concerts halls. Some live artist who participate are well known and others are up and coming. Some are events with 70's, 80's or 90's themes while others presenting the current styles of music. Some are live shows with artist and other are dancing events. These are usually free or low cost events that are sponsored by The Making A Difference with Morinda Organization which focuses on charity, health and fitness. So some events may include a short sponsorship presentation or venue advertisement of maintaining and living in better health from a sponsor representative for 30 minutes prior to a show.

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. In 2014 BNI members passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business. Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 20+ (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 20+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Tuesdays at 7:00AM at Junior's) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?! Current Location: Junior's 386 Flatbush Ave Ext Brooklyn, NY 11201 Cost: $20\/visitor The meeting starts at 7:00am and is officially over at 8:30am. You will need to bring 50+ business cards to pass to everyone in the room. You will also need to be prepared to tell the room who you are, what you do, and who a perfect referral for you would be. The more specific you are in asking for the referral the greater chance you have in receiving that life changing referral on the spot.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/highres_444800198.jpeg","photo_id":444800198,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/600_444800198.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/thumb_444800198.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":196314630,"name":"Revenue Raisers","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/highres_251811307.jpeg","photo_id":251811307,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/member_251811307.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/thumb_251811307.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"BNI Revenue Raisers, Brooklyn NY","id":19173196,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Revenue-Raisers-Brooklyn-NY","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449036248000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"interracial","name":"Interracial Families","id":1861},{"urlkey":"food-tasting","name":"Food Tasting","id":17132},{"urlkey":"brunch","name":"Brunch","id":18239},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"kid-friendly-activities","name":"Kid Friendly Activities","id":26453},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"home-cooking","name":"Home Cooking","id":32289},{"urlkey":"cooking-at-home","name":"Cooking at Home","id":73417},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Umi-Family\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We'll be holding regular community potlucks celebrating culinary entrepreneurship mainly in the Brooklyn community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Umi is a platform for culinary entrepreneurship and a marketplace for home cooking.

Circles happen on or near the evening of the new moon because this is the best time, astrologically, to plant seeds for what we long to manifest in our lives and for the world. Setting intentions with a group is a powerful practice because it allows your dreams and longings to be witnessed and supported by others. It also holds you accountable to taking the necessary action, internally and externally, to manifest your longings. While every circle has a different theme, there in always meditation, group sharing (optional), and the writing and speaking of individual intentions. Circles may also incorporate aspects of spiritual ceremony and ritual; however, it is not religious and open to women of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths.

We want to make our love specific towards each other, people, the city, and life we encounter everyday. As we learn to live the way of Jesus, we tolerate a fairly high level of theological diversity and struggle, and try not to be easily breakable. We have very little formal organizational structure. We are not formally associated with any denomination, and we admire and owe our existence to many. Our community consists of Lutherans, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Seventh-day Adventists, Quakers, Presbyterians, Humanists, Jews, Muslims, and many other forgotten ones. The seed that grew into Citylights faith community was a \u201cseeker space\u201d that met in a church basement during the winter of 2000-2001. The group was comprised of people with various spiritual backgrounds and experiences, and included both people who thought of themselves as Christians and those who didn\u2019t. The shared purpose in coming together was to have a forum where it was safe to ask tough questions about spirituality and discuss possible answers, or open better questions, to be honest about what made sense and what didn\u2019t, and to enjoy the community itself. Out of this group emerged the vision for a faith community that could nourish honesty, creativity, and action, at any stage in their faith journey. During 2001-2002, the core group that began Citylights spent the year studying small-group community dynamics and developing a vision and road map for the future. In the winter of 2003, we launched two small-group communities that met in apartments on a weekday night. The intention was for people to get beyond the four walls of a church building and share real life together, and to reinforce the idea that true community requires regular interaction. In June 2003, Citylights started Saturday gatherings. In the fall of 2003, Citylights developed the vision to be a \u201ccommunity learning to love well.\u201d We believe that this is ultimate goal of being a follower of Jesus Christ. This vision guides both our visible and hidden curriculum. We are attempting to educate ourselves about God, ourselves, \u201cthe other,\u201d and all of life, so we can love well. We are activists for responsibility, justice and mercy in our city, because we think that\u2019s an expression of love for our fellow human beings. We love arts. We love to discuss. We love to sing. We love to dance. We love to eat. We want to love well and we believe that you can help us learn to love better! We are children friendly and have regular kids programing.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196394362,"name":"CityLights Community ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/highres_251855934.jpeg","photo_id":251855934,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/member_251855934.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/thumb_251855934.jpeg"}},"members":108,"name":"Citylights NYC - A Progressive Christian Community","id":19179005,"state":"NY","urlname":"Citylights-NYC-A-Progressive-Christian-Community","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449173646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"networkmarket","name":"Network Marketing","id":2532},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"networking-leads","name":"Networking Leads","id":16659},{"urlkey":"networking-social-gatherings","name":"Networking & Social Gatherings","id":16789},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"networking-events","name":"Networking Events","id":19961},{"urlkey":"business-to-business-network-marketing","name":"Business to Business Network Marketing","id":26217},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/https-www-facebook-com-463024237237597-7\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>International Networking Week\u00ae is an initiative of BNI\u00ae.

French Roast or Martini is designed to casually explore and chat about your experiences and offer our perspectives from many years of education, research and practical application.

I myself often lack the focus, energy, time and motivation to cook healthy, wholesome meals, even though I have tons of cookbooks and know how to. Being single can do that to you, and it's not good for my waistline or my budget. We can meetup at my place (I have a large dining room and kitchen) and divide whatever meals people bring into tupperwares, taking home nice portions to eat through-out the week. One of the main reasons I don't like cooking as a single woman is leftovers... I'm not a fan... so this kind of takes care of that problem. Instead of eating the same meal 7 nights in a row, we can have 7 or more people come and eat a different meal each night of the week! My apartment has a very spacious living room, dining room and kitchen. It's best we prepare food at our own places, but if needed, we can do some meal prep at my place too. I have a slow cooker, rice cooker, deep fryer and every other cooking gadget imaginable. I'm no longer a vegetarian, so I'm open to meals of any kind. Healthy is nice though. Casseroles and one pot meals are great. We'll balance it out when we see what people plan to bring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe we can kick back and have a few drinks too. I have a nice big patio\/2nd flr.

We gather in a safe, relaxed setting to discuss death, celebrate life, and drink tea (or coffee), and eat delicious cake together. Not morbid at all!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Death Caf\u00e9 was started in 2011 by Jon Underwood and based on the work of Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz. Bernard offered \"Caf\u00e9 Mortels\" in Switzerland and France. Jon read of this in a newspaper article in November 2010. Jon was already developing a project to get people talking about death and immediately knew that Bernard\u2019s vision clicked with his. Fast forward to July 2012, when Lizzy Miles brought Death Caf\u00e9 to the US in Columbus, Ohio. Today there are more than 2600 Death Caf\u00e9s held globally\u2026won't you be part of this growing movement? Our Death Caf\u00e9 welcomes, and is open to the community. We have no intention of leading people to any conclusion, product or course of action\u2026just deep conversation and cake!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is limited seating so please RSVP.

My hope is to unite people committed to raising godly children, and for us to all grow as we seek direction from God. Let us get together and see what the Lord has in store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are especially welcome to this group if you have realized that parenting is more than you can handle on your own. &nbsp;You are especially welcome to this group If you have some relational issues that have not been resolved and you know it is affecting your parenting. &nbsp;You are especially welcome if you don't know where you stand with God. &nbsp;Everyone is in a different place in life and God knows it already. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There will be many resources shared during our meet-ups to coach us and help us along the parenting journey. &nbsp;So come on in and stay awhile.<\/p>","lon":-73.8899993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":28693232,"name":"Elle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/highres_251998184.jpeg","photo_id":251998184,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/member_251998184.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/thumb_251998184.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Yonkers Homeschooling Meetup","id":19197308,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yonkers-Christian-Homeschooling-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Everyone"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449673014000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"private-lending","name":"Private Lending","id":30026},{"urlkey":"private-money-lending","name":"Private Money Lending","id":154505},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-lending","name":"Peer-to-Peer Lending","id":298291},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-economy","name":"Peer to Peer Economy","id":1173472},{"urlkey":"online-lending","name":"Online lending","id":1506119}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/P2P-and-Marketplace-Lending-Operators\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>* Who should join: People with general interest in p2p and marketplace lending should join.

The mission of this group is to get <b>divorcees,<\/b> single parents and children out interacting with each other for fun, humor, laughs, camaraderie, support and friendship, and to enhance lives in the process. Few members that we have, often describe that the relationships forged in this group are often deep and rich. This is true of the friendships our kids would make with other kids in the group as well as the relationships their parents form. Most members describe the group as \u201cfamily.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We try to run this group in a very professional, non-judgmental (\u201cDon\u2019t judge others because they sin differently than you do.\u201d), and impartial manner (avoiding conflict of interest, if any) \u2013 \u201cNirbhay Nirvaer\u201d. It is extremely important to maintain high degree of integrity and respect for each other. We expect that members will follow through on their commitments to attend an event when they RSVP \u201cYes.\u201d Chronic no-shows or late cancellations may result in removal from the group. We also have a WhatsApp chat for people to connect in real-time. <b>Please contact us if you want to be a member of WhatsApp chat(1-917-825-3695\/1-609-354-8080).<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We all know the trials and tribulations of single parents <b>and divorcees<\/b>. We provide a unique and amazing opportunity for support and friendship. It is only possible by the efforts of the all-volunteer organizers and event hosts. Please show your appreciation to our volunteers who put out the time, effort (and sometimes their own money) to organize and host wonderful events, and come up with amazing ideas to post these events. Sometimes a simple thank-you can make the effort worthwhile.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d love for you to host an event, too! If you would like to host an event, please contact us to indicate that you are interested in becoming an event organizer of the group. Once you are made an event-organizer, you can then create your own events without asking anyone to create one for you.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you so much for joining now your group :).

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in New York. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have. Or simply say hello and introduce yourself because I would like to learn about you and the projects you are working on!

In an inexplicable act of sabotage, a previous organizer shut it down on New Year's Day 2016 (despite a stated pledge not to do so), thereby wiping out all files, studies, reports, photos, discussions, e-lists and the entire institutional memory of the group. This represented the collective product of many feminists over numerous years. <br><\/p>\n<p>This valuable resource was created for the benefit of, and was open to, the entire Feminist community, members and non-members alike. It will take some time, but we will rebuild both the site and the collective inclusive spirit of the group. Silence in not an option. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please be a feminist or open to feminism if you join<\/b>. There are plenty of other groups to join if you are neither. Beyond that, we welcome feminists of all stripes, colors, creeds, and gender identities who are committed to challenging, confronting, and ultimately dismantling Patriarchy. Together we hope to forge a path to sexual equality and gender justice for all, not just by talking amongst ourselves, but by speaking out, writing, marching, demonstrating, protesting and actively projecting a loud and fierce voice in opposition to Rape Culture and the War on Women. <br><\/p>\n<p>Male supremacy must end. Oppression and violence is not natural or inevitable. Neither is patriarchy or any other kind of kyriarchy (any collection of interlocking and intersecting systems of oppression). Radical Feminism, in the truest sense of the word 'Radical', is about going to the root of the systems of oppression that we all participate in and perpetuate, creating change from the ground up and making the world a better,&nbsp; more equitable, non-oppressive place. <br><\/p>\n<p>We believe change is not only possible but probable and above all necessary.

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are looking for the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Photographers<\/p>\n<p>-DJs&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Tent rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Limousine rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Party Favor suppliers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Magicians&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Animal show businesses&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Inflatable rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Spray Art&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p>\n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo.

However, parents may reach out to group members \u2013 individually to seek help with their child\u2019s party prep \u2013 if needed.

It's like a book club, except for video games! What that means is that we'll be planning meet-ups once a month at a local bookstore, game shop or public library so we can talk about some game or games that we've all been playing for that month! This is meant to be a relaxing, casual get-together where you can meet new people, share a common interest with new friends, and maybe even learn some new things about your favorite game(s)!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do ask that everyone signing up for the group have a clear picture of themselves on their profile so that we can recognize members for each meetup. I'll be taking suggestions from the sign-up questions on what our games for each month are going to be, and we'll go from there. Other than that, all we ask is that you're ready to have a good time and talk about games!

Yet, the networking event has become a commodity. Many events around town focus on attracting volumes of attendees, exchanging business cards and potentially meeting someone new. Sure, it's great if your goals are aligned to any one or more of these results. However, you're probably asking yourself these two questions when you leave the event:<\/p>\n<p>How many true connections did I make? <br>Was the event worth my time?<\/p>\n<p>Chances are....you probably didn't get what you paid for (in time and money).<\/p>\n<p>Our goal for NYC Startup Connectors is to create opportunities for entrepreneurs and other business professionals to connect in a more meaningful way. What do we mean by meaningful? Bringing people together for a defined purpose that aims to help you. Our events and activities focus on the art of connecting, rather than networking.

The space is limited, I want to keep my meetup small, around 8 people. &nbsp;That's two tables. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I know the RSVP says 16 spots, it's because a good friend of mine told me about the golden rule of meetups:\"If the RSVP says 16 people signed up, it usually means only 8 will actually show up\". It has proven to be true in all my previous free meetup events. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n<p>If for any reason, nobody or too few people (&lt; 4) RSVPs by 1 pm, two days before the meetup, then I will cancel it. &nbsp;I do this because I need time to decide where we will have our meetup. &nbsp;Since this is a brand new meetup, I don't know where everybody lives yet. &nbsp;I'm not going to know until everybody RSVPs. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>**But if you RSVP and you don't show up, I will remove you from the group. &nbsp;This is to be fair to everybody who want to come but can't because you are taking up their spot. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>**We will try to meet every Sun, 1 pm- 4 pm at a regular location. The time is subject to change, but I prefer Sunday, during the day. I have not decided on the location yet because I simply don't know where my members will be coming from. They may live anywhere from Mahwah to Monclair, or from Paramus to Fort Lee. &nbsp;Once we have 4 or more members, then we can take a vote, and see what would be the best central location for our meetup. &nbsp;I have put my flyers in a few local libraries and three college libraries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>**January 31, 2016 will be our introductory meetup. &nbsp;We can talk about the type of writing we are working on, our writing experience, what made us want to become writers. You can bring your work, we will go over it if time permits.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;**Here are the requirements for my ideal permanent meetup location: must be indoors, has heat and AC, free other than buying a cup of coffee, allow low to normal level conversations, not too noisy that you can\u2019t hear each other talk, accommodate a group of up to 8 people, open on Sunday afternoon, public place, brightly lit, within 25 miles of Fort Lee, with reasonable amount of privacy, and easy to park. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>**This rules out parks (not indoor, no ac or heat), private homes (not public place), bars (too dim, too noisy), most coffee shops (too dim, too noisy), etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I have some good locations that meet all these requirements:<\/p>\n<p>1. Ramapo college library (open from 12 pm - 12 am on Sunday)<\/p>\n<p>2. Montclair univeristy library (open from 12 pm - 9 pm on Sunday)<\/p>\n<p>3. Hackensack Barnes &amp; Noble (open 10 am -10 pm on Sunday)<\/p>\n<p>**My background:I like to tell you a little bit about myself. I discovered my new passion for writing only a few months ago. When I went to high school, I could barely write a 5-page essay. But 2015 was an important year, it was the turning point of my life. A series of life changing events had helped me discover my purpose and passion in life. I\u2019ve been writing every single day for the past two months. I\u2019ve written over 10 articles for my blog. My longest article is 30 pages or 12,000 words. It took me a whole week to write it, another week to proof read it, still a third week to translate it to Chinese. This very long article is about my transformation in the past year and my spiritual journey. I will share it with everybody at the meetup. It is my most popular blog. I\u2019ve had 14,000 visits in the first week.<\/p>\n<p>**About the other writers meetups:<\/p>\n<p>Next, I like to tell you why I am trying to start my own writers meetup. There are a few established writing meetups in New Jersey but the closest one that I like is 30 miles away, and they limit our maximum work that we can bring to 1,500 words or 3.5 pages. Therefore, I am trying to see if I can organize a group of writers closer to home and with higher maximum limit on our work (like 2,500 words or 5 pages). All age and experiences are welcome. I've looked at some other writer's groups and these are the problems that I have with them:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. There are some writing meetups that you show up and you write. I think that's pretty dumb because I can write at home, why would I travel to a meetup to write?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. There are other meetups that take place in people's private homes because they don't have a regular location. This gets pretty confusing because I'll be going to a new house at every meetup.<\/p>\n<p>3. There are some meetups that limit the work that we can bring to 2 pages or 1,000 words. This is pointless because my shortest work is 5 pages or 2,200 words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. Many other writers\u2019 meetups are non-critiquing. So what's the point of going to a writer's meetup if you can't get any feedback?<\/p>\n<p>**Therefore, my meetup will be a constructive critiquing meetup at a regular location, with a maximum limit of 2,500 words or 5 pages.&nbsp;We write all our works at home.<\/p>\n<p>Rules of my NJAW meetup (North Jersey Aspiring Writers meetup)<\/p>\n<p>Rule 1 - RSVP<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and you don't show up, you will be removed from the group. &nbsp;If you think you won't be able to make it, please change your RSVP at least 24 hours before it ends, so that other members can have a chance.<\/p>\n<p>Rule&nbsp;<span>2 - Respect<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Be respectful to other writer's work. &nbsp;No discrimination, making fun,or any offensive remakrs are tolerated. &nbsp;The offender will be given one warning only and then asked to leave. &nbsp;Then he or she will be permanently removed from the group.<\/p>\n<p>Rule 3 - Privacy<\/p>\n<p>Respect our privacy. &nbsp;Some of us may write fictions. &nbsp;Other may write our memoirs or autobiographies. &nbsp;These are personal stories that should stay in the group. &nbsp;No gossiping is permitted. &nbsp;Otherwise, the offender will be removed from the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br>How do I run the writers meetup:<\/p>\n<p>Let's assume we will meet at a college library. &nbsp;I will announce the address of the college, directions to the library (what building, what floor, what room, etc). &nbsp;You should have my cell number by now. &nbsp;If not, it's 917-294-5687. &nbsp;I will wait by the library entrance (either inside or outside) from 12:50 -1:10. &nbsp;Then we will pick a good location with enough seats and tables for the number of people that show up. &nbsp;It's usually four people per table. &nbsp;If we have more than four people and we can't find a bigger table. &nbsp;I will ask someone to volunteer to be my assistant organizer. &nbsp;We will spit up into two groups. &nbsp;Since this is the library, we probably won't be able to read our works out loud, so we will read it to ourselves quietly. &nbsp; &nbsp;I will hand out color pens, so that everyone can write comments, make corrections on each other's work. &nbsp;Be sure to write your name on the top of the first page of the person's work, so we know who made the comments.By at the end of the meetup, all copies of the work should be returned to the writer. &nbsp;We will have time to discuss each other's work, but we must use our indoor voice since this is the library. &nbsp; <br> <br>History of NJAW:<\/p>\n<p>This is a brand new meetup created on January 5, 2016. &nbsp;Maybe there used to be a similar named meetup before that I am not aware of. &nbsp;But this has nothing to do with the other one.<\/p>\n<p>When I first created this meetup, it was called the \"Fort Lee Book Writers meetup\", since I live in Fort Lee. &nbsp; Then, I quickly realized that limiting the meetup to only Fort Lee is a huge mistake. &nbsp;Nowadays, very few people read anymore, even fewer writes. &nbsp;Writers are a dying breed. It is sad, but true. &nbsp; So I changed my meetup name to \"North Jersey Aspiring Writers meetup\" include the entire northern Jersey. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I originally planned to meet on Saturday. &nbsp;But I soon realized that it was another mistake. &nbsp;Saturdays are the most traffic congested day of the week. &nbsp;Sundays are much better. &nbsp;If you are reading this, &nbsp;then that means the auto-welcome message has already been updated. &nbsp;I apologize for the confusion. <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>My email: shenjw12000@gmail.com,&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My cell phone: 917-294-5687<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to see you there. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/9\/c\/highres_445710108.jpeg","photo_id":445710108,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/9\/c\/600_445710108.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/9\/c\/thumb_445710108.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":95726052,"name":"James Shen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/highres_252502460.jpeg","photo_id":252502460,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/member_252502460.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/b\/c\/thumb_252502460.jpeg"}},"members":3,"name":"North Jersey Aspiring Writers Meetup","id":19284021,"state":"NJ","urlname":"North-Jersey-Aspiring-Writers-Meetup","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"aspiring writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452025626000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-socials","name":"Coffee and Tea Socials","id":18105},{"urlkey":"ladies","name":"Ladies","id":18333},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea","name":"Coffee & Tea","id":36145},{"urlkey":"coffee-talk","name":"Coffee Talk","id":40535},{"urlkey":"coffee-mornings","name":"Coffee Mornings","id":50566},{"urlkey":"morning","name":"Morning","id":81529},{"urlkey":"coffee-shops","name":"Coffee Shops","id":90721},{"urlkey":"coffee-and-chat","name":"Coffee and Chat","id":95614},{"urlkey":"breakfast-and-coffee-mornings-morning-tea-and-cake","name":"Breakfast and coffee mornings Morning Tea and Cake","id":1456292}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ladies-Coffee-Morning-in-and-around-Hoboken\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a new ladies only coffee morning, specifically for expats however \"locals\" are welcome too, in and around Hoboken.

You need to register any character, deck,&nbsp;or army with an official Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top Dungeon Master though.&nbsp; All characters need to be&nbsp;produced and rolled in front of an official group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; All decks need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All armies need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; This is to ensure that characters and stats are not&nbsp;altered and that characters are&nbsp;using their actual rolled stats and not illegally inflated stats.&nbsp; <strong><em>When the group has more members than space to play, there is going to be a cost of $10.00 a character, $10.00 a deck,&nbsp;and $15.00 an army for registration.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; Every group member gets to register 3 characters and&nbsp;1 army for free.&nbsp; You do not have to pay for sessions as long as you are using a registered character, or army, that has not died.&nbsp; Characters can not be reused or reregistered after they die.&nbsp; Armies and decks can be reused, but need to be reregistered and renamed, after they are defeated in battle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Usually, we are going to give at least 3 months notice prior to beginning any campaign.&nbsp; You need to register for the campaign via meetup. If you are absent from a session during a campaign, you either are given a loss for that battle, or your character is said to be in a limbo and remains in place until you return.&nbsp; If you do not return for 3 Meetups in&nbsp;a row, your character dies.&nbsp; You are not allowed to reuse a dead character.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>REGISTRION COST:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Characters:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE&nbsp; (There is currently no cost for registering&nbsp;Characters with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Armies:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Armies&nbsp;with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decks:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Decks with this group.)<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Thank you,<\/p>\n<p>Erik<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/highres_445811825.jpeg","photo_id":445811825,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/600_445811825.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/thumb_445811825.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197771903,"name":"Erik","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/highres_252697901.jpeg","photo_id":252697901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/member_252697901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/thumb_252697901.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"The Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top group!","id":19296737,"state":"NY","urlname":"rpgclub","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452192657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"new-in-town-women-only","name":"New in Town: Women Only","id":74490},{"urlkey":"new-in-town-social","name":"New In Town: Social","id":78498}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-to-New-York-time-to-connect-with-great-women\/","rating":0,"description":"I'm new to New York City and am eager to meet some wonderful women who want to explore Manhattan, etc with like women.

I\u2019ve always had fairly good self-esteem and confidence about my body and myself- and wanted the same for others. Of course we\u2019re not going to feel great about ourselves 24\/7, but I want to help more people feel happy, healthy, to love and accept themselves, and to realize how incredible they are. For a long time, I had a narrow view of what it meant to have positive body image- mostly dictated by what society said we should judge ourselves by: a specific beauty ideal, weight, what people thought, and by what we were eating. Throughout my personal evolution, I have learned to grow exponentially stronger in the love for my body and discovered this emerging body positive culture. What initially ignited my fire and determination to add to this important conversation about positive body image is the many women I started to meet post high school struggling with serious body image issues, and although I have not personally suffered, their experiences touched me greatly. What matters to me, and what I want to spread throughout my life- be it with the weights classes, Zumba classes, BollyX classes I teach or Meetups I run- is the importance of inner health -to prevent against disease etc- and that our weight and appearance does not determine our beauty nor worth. I'm clear that loving ourselves and our bodies is the best path to take- not negative self-talk or hate. I want to create a community where women can come and talk about a healthy body image and see themselves in a positive, loving light. Join me and let's talk about what it means for you!

Women all over the world are waking up to a new renaissance of the heart, soul and body, reclaiming her inner voice and taking steps towards freedom.<\/p>\n<p>For the last five years I have been clearing out my emotional baggage, mental toxicity and repairing my relationship with my physical body. I overcame breast cancer and had to take a really hard look at all the emotional abuse I was carrying around from my relationship with my parents and men, I was acting out subconsciously, seeking love from a pain point. My wounds were speaking louder than my heart, they began to show me how unhappy I was. Fast forward five years to today. Today I travel and teach throughout North America sharing with women a journey to self love, a two day emotionally empowering discovery of learning how to love yourself, honestly, courageously and with joy. I know you have been yearning to share with a group of women who have your back, seeking support from others who can understand your own journey, acknowledging your pain while uplifting you to greater new heights of self awareness. You've been ready for a long time now, searching and seeking your own journey to self love. I've been there, let me help guide you along the way so that you can get there with the support that you need to accelerate your life to one of freedom and inner peace. I am grateful to be able to share with you all that I have learned on my own journey to self love!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Goldfarb, Licensed Soul Therapist, Spiritual Healer &amp; Guide<\/p>\n<p><span>Testimonials:<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>I had the pleasure of taking Carolyn's \"A Journey To Self Love\" group class and it was amazing! She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. - Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/p>\n<p>I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me. - Alexandra B., NYC<\/p>\n<p>If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before. As good as it gets!!! :) - Danielle S..

Presenters prepare a 6 minute educational presentation and engage in 20 minutes of feedback and questioning after they present. Entrepreneurs gain insight into possible ways they can improve their businesses, gather real-time feedback, connect with a community that truly cares about their progress, and walk away feeling like they have advanced their business. The audience also learns a great deal from the presentations.

However, it is seldom taught anywhere and consequently most networkers fail to get adequate return out of their investment in business networking meetings. \n\nBusiness networking is not about exchanging cards!\n\nThere are tools such as elevator pitches, one-on-ones, strategic alliances, follow ups and social media that you need to master. Whether you are a pro or a newbie, our tools help you tremendously in honing your business networking skills. Our events are quality events that help you grow into a power networker who gets real business out of networking meetings. We also strive to create a synergistic referral network for you. \n\nAt our events you can: \n\n\n\u2022 Mingle with like minded individuals and create strong business relationships.\n\n\u2022 Reach everyone in the meetup through elevator pitches.\n\n\u2022 Take part in our highly successful interactive educational programs.\n\n\u2022 Learn more about the mindset and skills of business ownership.\n\n\u2022 Learn about and create strategic alliances.\n\n\u2022 Become a spotlight speaker and promote your business. \n\nAbout myself: I have been organizing one of the highest ranked NY Connect and Grow business networking group on meetup with 4200+ members and felt a need of a networking group which teaches people how to network.

This group is open to anyone who identifies as a woman, and we do not subscribe to any particular philosophy or set of beliefs.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13818527,"name":"Mia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/7\/d\/highres_252791389.jpeg","photo_id":252791389,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/7\/d\/member_252791389.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/7\/d\/thumb_252791389.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"NYC Women's Discussion Group","id":19317878,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Womens-Discussion-Group","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Women's Salon-ers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Newark","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452497235000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"electronicmusic","name":"Electronic Music","id":411},{"urlkey":"housemusic","name":"House Music","id":6672},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"clubbing","name":"Clubbing","id":17969},{"urlkey":"electronic-dance-music","name":"Electronic Dance Music","id":17970},{"urlkey":"afro-beat","name":"Afro Beat","id":26715},{"urlkey":"tech-house-music","name":"tech house music","id":37156},{"urlkey":"house-music-dancers","name":"House Music Dancers","id":45984},{"urlkey":"soulfull-vocal-house-music","name":"Soulfull Vocal House Music","id":71427},{"urlkey":"soulful-house","name":"Soulful House","id":122194},{"urlkey":"afro-deep-house","name":"AFRO-DEEP HOUSE","id":156019}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Northern-and-Central-Jersey-Soulful-House-Music-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Peace and Blessings my friends.

His novel The Radetzky March, which appeared two years later, is almost universally recognized as a classic. Yet Roth\u2019s earlier work, in which he probingly examined the upheavals of his time\u2014particularly the Russian revolution\u2014have only recently been rediscovered. In the United States, a new anthology of his early reportage, The Hotel Years, has just been published by New Directions, and in Germany his newly published essays on Russia have been celebrated by critics and readers alike. Are we experiencing an international Roth Renaissance? Jan B\u00fcrger and George Prochnik will discuss one of the most important and enigmatic writers of the modern era, and provide insights into his astonishing body of work with the aid of manuscripts and letters from the Leo Baeck Institute, New York, and the German Literature Archive, Marbach. Jan B\u00fcrger is a literary scholar and author. He wrote his dissertation about Hans Henny Jahnn, belongs to the founding editors of the Berlin journal Literaturen, and has worked since 2002 at the German Literature Archive. In addition to numerous contributions to journals and newspapers (including Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he has written Der gestrandete Wal: Das ma\u00dflose Leben des Hans Henny Jahnn (2003), Benns Doppelleben oder wie man sich selbst zusammensetzt (2006), Max Frisch: Das Tagebuch (2011) and Der Neckar: Eine literarische Reise (2013). He is also the editor of a number of events including Ich bin nicht innerlich. Ann\u00e4herungen an Gottfried Benn (2003), Friedrich Schiller: Dichter, Denker, Vor- und Gegenbild (2007), Liebe ist Quatsch. Briefe an Ellinor by Hans Henny Jahnn (with Sandra Hiemer, 2014) Briefwechsel by Alfred Andersch and Max Frisch (2014), as well as Reisen in die Ukraine und nach Russland by Joseph Roth (2015). George Prochnik has written for the The New York Times, The New Yorker, Bookforum and the LA Review of Books.

Most importantly, do you want to become more happy and satisfied? If you answered yes to any of those questions, MBTI Enthusiasts is for you! Through MBTI Personality Types we will learn more about ourselves and understand our differences with other people. I created this group to bring together people who have an interest in the Myers Briggs Type Indicator in an informal\/relaxed environment where we can learn from each other through interactive activities and intellectual discussions about 16 types. Whether you are expert or dummy in MBTI Personality Types, we welcome you! This is the place to be if you'd like to socialize with people who share an awareness of the importance of personality. We encourage to hold space for each other to learn about and understand our differences. Come to join us to make some new friends and have a good time! 16 types are: INFP, ENFP, INFJ, ENFJ, INTP, ENTP, INTJ, ENTJ, ISFJ, ESFJ, ISFP, ESFP, ISTP, ESTP, ISTJ, ESTJ.
