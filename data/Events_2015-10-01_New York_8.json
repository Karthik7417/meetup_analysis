It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This class will get \u201chands on\u201d with activities and exercises that will encourage participants to practice their new storytelling skills.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT YOU\u2019LL LEARN<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why storytelling is important for social change<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are the essential elements and structures of a good story<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to find and craft compelling stories<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to adapt and refine your storytelling<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are some of the possible applications of storytelling<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to integrate one\u2019s personal and professional stories<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to use stories to stand out in a crowd<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to imbue stories with values and emotion<\/p> <p><b>WHO THIS CLASS IS FOR \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals, entrepreneurs, creatives, and communications strategists\/marketers ready to focus on company and brand storytelling<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals who have an idea for a project, organization or business that will drive change<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals who already use storytelling in their work looking to find ways to systematize and refine their approach<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals curious about how storytelling can enrich their work.<\/p> <p><b>INSTRUCTOR BIO<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/1311863\/lsignitenyc6501.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Lee-Sean Huang (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/leesean\">@LeeSean<\/a>)<\/b> is the cofounder and creative director of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foossa.com\/\"><b>Foossa<\/b><\/a>.

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!<\/p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dl.dropboxusercontent.com\/u\/64476072\/Kickball%20Rules.pdf<\/a><\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.neighborhoodsports.us\/Rules\/KickballRules\/tabid\/155\/Default.aspx\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>The important stuff ...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

They work with Apps, content editor web parts, .NET solutions, and anywhere else you can utilize JavaScript (Even CSS!). Some of my favorites covered in this session are jQuery, SPServices, jqPlot, and DataTables.<\/p> <p>In this session I will show how to get up and running developing with JavaScript for SharePoint in multiple ways. Then I will demo each of my \u201cgo-to\u201d libraries as well as a few others. I will discuss real world application of these libraries based on previous clients where I have used them.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation.

The ideas expressed here will remove from your consciousness any fear of so-called death.<\/p> <p>Reincarnation is one of the world's most disputed doctrine. The belief in reincarnation has had millions of intelligent, learned, and tolerant followers throughout the ages. Ringing through the minds and hearts of students, mystics, and thinkers have always been the words: \"Why Are We Here?\" Reincarnation has been criticized by some as conflicting with sacred literature and as being without verification. This book reveals, however, in an intelligent manner the many facts to support reincarnation.<\/p> <p>Quotations from eminent authorities, and from Biblical\u00a0and Sacred works substantiate reincarnation. It places it high above mere speculation. This book is without exaggeration the most complete, inspiring, enlightening book ever written on this subject. It is not a fiction story but a step-by-step revelation of profound mystical laws. Look at some of these thought-provoking, intriguing subjects: The Cosmic Conception; The Personality of the Soul; Does Personality Survive Transition?; Heredity and Inheritance; Karma and Personal Evolution; Religious and Biblical Viewpoints; Christian References; Between Incarnations; Souls of Animals and the \"Unborn\"; Recollections of the Past.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224384194\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"COSI - Mansions of the Soul: The Oversoul & Cycles of Incarnations","id":"fpbtflytmbdc","time":1442961000000,"updated":1442973077000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10034","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"330 West 40th street, (between 8th and 9th avenue)","name":"Skyroom Rooftop","lon":-73.918007,"id":2683201,"state":"NY","lat":40.862411,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.64890575409,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442540608000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Last week we had over 500 for fashion week but this week will be more low key for conversations and a great fashion show!<\/p> <p><br\/>*Free introductions from your host<\/p> <p>*Optional name tags for easy mingling<\/p> <p>*Show starts around 9:15PM<\/p> <p><br\/>*Social Networking followed by a live fashion show<\/p> <p><b>*Free Swiss chocolate from 6-8PM or while supplies last!!!<\/b><\/p> <p>*DJ Spinning from 7 to 11PM<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Fashionista-Meetup\/events\/225436585\/","yes_rsvp_count":61,"name":"Wine, Chocolate & Fashion @ Skyroom Penthouse","id":"225436585","time":1442961000000,"updated":1442973202000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389565919000,"name":"Manhattan Fashion & Creative People Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":12056402,"urlname":"Manhattan-Fashionista-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Fashion Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"808 Columbus Ave,","name":"Whole Foods","lon":-73.966743,"id":21737572,"state":"NY","lat":40.794708,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.32679319382,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428802939000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We play the kind of rummy where once you lay down the cards, you and other players can move them around into different configurations.\u00a0 Each hand is quite long but it is more fun than gin rummy, which is over once your cards are down.\u00a0 If you want to practice before your first visit, you can download the software here:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/Romi\/3000-2647_4-10317463.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/Romi\/3000-2647_4-10317463.html<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe also enjoy playing Oh Hell, which is easy to learn, but hard to win!\u00a0 We need 3 players minimum for this.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk past the checkouts to where the tables are set up to eat.

Each party brings to the project a language specific to their respective medium. And each can have something the other needs. A filmmaker can be looking for interactive non-linearity to give new meaning to their narrative, while the designer and technologist can be seeking out the cinematic linearity of film to give essential meaning to their aesthetic and code. The artistic success of a project is related to how deep these transactions go, and to what extent perceived barriers between film, design and code are eliminated.<\/p> <p>Filmmaker <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moonwinxfilms.com\/\">Andrew Beck Grace<\/a> and Toronto-based Helios Design Labs worked remotely for six months to produce the interactive documentary essay \"After the Storm\" with project financing from ITVS. Perhap we could look into the how and why of interactive, web-native nonfiction content by using \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d as a test-case for this kind of work.

It's sometimes called the 8th continent due to its unique evolution and physical isolation. Ninety percent of its wildlife is found nowhere else, and its lemurs are Earth's most diverse group of primates. With no monkeys to compete with, Madagascar's lemurs evolved into over 100 species, from the 3.5-inch Berthe's mouse lemur (the smallest primate in the world) to the now-extinct giant sloth lemur (which weighed as much as a gorilla).<\/p> <p>When primatologist Patricia Chapple Wright first visited Madagascar in the 1980s, she discovered the golden bamboo lemur, so called because of the golden fur on its head and belly and a habit of eating cyanide-laced bamboo shoots that would kill any other primate. At the time of her discovery, Dr. Wright learned the lemur's rain forest habitat was on the verge of being chopped down. To save the lemurs, she lobbied the Malagasy government and local villagers---as well as conservationists around the world. Her efforts led to the creation of Ranomafana National Park. It's there that Dr. Wright has conducted the bulk of her scientific research over the last three decades, studying the social and family behaviors of wild lemurs, and advocating for the preservation of Madagascar's endangered wildlife.<\/p> <p>Winner of the MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" and the 2014 Indianapolis Prize for her extraordinary contributions to wildlife conservation, Dr. Wright is one of the world's foremost experts on lemurs, professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University, and founder of Centre ValBio Research Station in Madagascar. She is the author of over 150 scientific papers, as well as the books High Moon Over the Amazon: My Quest to Understand the Monkeys of the Night and For the Love of Lemurs: My Life in the Wilds of Madagascar. She has organized and led over 40 expeditions to study the world's primates. Dr. Wright and her field research have been featured on film in Michael Apted's Me and Isaac Newton and the 3-D IMAX movie, Island of Lemurs.<\/p> <p>Before &amp; After\u00a0<br\/>--Sample our wild and swinging cocktail of the night, the Nocturnal Prowler<br\/>--Swing by your tail to almost-human grooves<br\/>--Stick around for the eye-popping Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>This wild edition\u00a0of the\u00a0Secret Science Club\u00a0meets Tuesday, September 22 @ the\u00a0Bell House,\u00a0149 7th St.\u00a0(between 2nd and 3rd avenues) in Gowanus,\u00a0Brooklyn.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

She shows us why an omniscient, omnipotent God is incompatible with science but still does not preclude the idea of a God that can comfort and empower us. Abrams helps to bridge the gap left by the culture wars between organized religion and modern science over God and cosmic knowledge. Beyond providing individual inspiration to face personal challenges, Abrams makes a compelling case that a shared understanding of a God that could be real is a planetary imperative necessary to overcome existential challenges like the slow-moving calamities of climate change, resource depletion, and mass extinction.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/>Nancy Ellen Abrams <\/b><\/p> <p>is a philosopher of science, lawyer and author. She and her husband, world-renowned cosmologist Joel Primack, developed a new visual language to express the big ideas underlying the new universe picture that Primack helped to create. For ten years they co-taught a course titled \u201cCosmology and Culture\u201d at the University of California, Santa Cruz which won prizes from the Templeton Foundation and the American Council of Learned Sciences. The course led to their co-authoring <i>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos <\/i>(Penguin\/Riverhead, 2006).

She shows us why an omniscient, omnipotent God is incompatible with science but still does not preclude the idea of a God that can comfort and empower us. Abrams helps to bridge the gap left by the culture wars between organized religion and modern science over God and cosmic knowledge. Beyond providing individual inspiration to face personal challenges, Abrams makes a compelling case that a shared understanding of a God that could be real is a planetary imperative necessary to overcome existential challenges like the slow-moving calamities of climate change, resource depletion, and mass extinction.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/>Nancy Ellen Abrams <\/b><\/p> <p>is a philosopher of science, lawyer and author. She and her husband, world-renowned cosmologist Joel Primack, developed a new visual language to express the big ideas underlying the new universe picture that Primack helped to create. For ten years they co-taught a course titled \u201cCosmology and Culture\u201d at the University of California, Santa Cruz which won prizes from the Templeton Foundation and the American Council of Learned Sciences. The course led to their co-authoring <i>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos <\/i>(Penguin\/Riverhead, 2006). In 2009 Yale University invited them to give the prestigious Terry Lectures which they rewrote to become <i>The New Universe and the Human Future: How a Shared Cosmology Could Transform the World <\/i>(Yale, 2011).

A key part of planning involves selecting articles, photographs, and other resources and storing these in the user's Favorites. Recently we migrated major parts of our technology stack to open source technologies. As part of our migration strategy, we zeroed in on MongoDB, since it better suited our requirements for speed and data structure as well as eliminating the need for a caching layer. The transition required a period in which both our legacy and new API where working concurrently with data being persisted on both databases (SQL and Mongo) and all records were being synched with every request. We resourced to many strategies and applications to achieve this goal, including: Pentaho, AWS SQS and SNS, a queue messenger system and some proprietary ruby gems. In this session we will review our strategy and some of the lessons we learned about successfully migrating with zero downtime.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Vlad Carballo is a Software Engineer, agile practitioner and analytical thinker with proven skills architecting and implementing multi-layer applications for the enterprise.<br\/>Consistently resolves ongoing issues while working in a team environment.

In this meetup, we will discuss the secret ingredient that most business owners and marketers overlook. Let's call it the \u201cDNA\u201d of your marketing campaign, or the buyer\u2019s persona. The psychology of a buyer's persona when they use social media has been the differentiator on why campaigns are successful and unsuccessful. This meetup will help business owners, marketers, and entrepreneurs leverage their buyer's persona data to target ads that will convert on the social channels that they use, and pin-point what social channels they should focus on.<\/p> <p>Panelists:<br\/><b>Nick Bulwin<\/b>, founder\/CEO, <b>Second Flight Consultancy<\/b><br\/><b>Kelly McCaughey<\/b>, marketing director, <b>Grey Sky Films Video Production Agency<\/b><br\/><b>Samantha Pena<\/b>, content strategist at <b>Hudson Integrated Web Agency<br\/><\/b>Moderator: <b>Michael Benyo<\/b>, president, <b>The Evolution Management Group<\/b><\/p> <p>Event is co-sponsored with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.montclair.edu\/residence-life\/\">Residence Life<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br\/>6:00-6:45 p.m. Networking with pizza<br\/>6:45-7:00 p.m. Welcome and 1-minute pitches from the audience<br\/>7:00-8:30 p.m. Panel discussion with audience Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>Directions and parking info: Park in the Red Hawk Deck on campus, exit the deck on Level 5 and proceed straight up the walkway (soccer field will be on your left) to the new School of Business building.<\/p> <p><br\/>Join the conversation on Twitter and Instagram: #MSUmeetup and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/felicianocenter\">@FelicianoCenter<\/a><\/p> <p>Speaker bios:<br\/><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nickbulwin\">Nick Bulwin<\/a><\/b> is the Founder\/CEO of <b><a href=\"http:\/\/secondflightconsultancy.com\/\">Second Flight Consultancy<\/a><\/b>.

In short, this talk will describe the path we took in adopting Solr, speed bumps and potholes we hit along the way, where we are currently, and what the future roadmap looks like for using Solr in the HBS Enterprise.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bio:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Ravi Mynampaty is just another search guy. He believes that making incremental changes is an effective path towards improving search and tries to make this happen on a daily basis. He is currently working on Enterprise Search at HBS, which includes setting Enterprise Search strategy, design and implementation of findability standards, search tools, and search user interfaces. Ravi has masters degree in engineering from the University of Massachusetts and Brandeis University.<\/p> <p>Food and drinks will be served.<\/p> <p>Books will be given away.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup\/events\/223763189\/","yes_rsvp_count":93,"name":"How We Spiked the HBS water supply with Solr","id":"223763189","time":1443047400000,"updated":1443059611000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246465233000,"name":"NYC Apache Lucene\/Solr Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1482573,"urlname":"NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Luceners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692301332951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423090689000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WHAT WE DO<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen space for artists &amp; technologists to get hands-on with new technology.

While all organized trips doing the whole trip are 2 weeks long (i.e., time away from the south), I would like to\u00a0go there for three weeks to have about 18 days in the Park so there is plenty of time to explore and climb some non-technical summits such as Tete Blanche, Tyr and Battle.\u00a0 The scenery is great from the valley but it got just amazing once you climb up a bit to see the Penny ice cap (i.e., 6,000 km2 or 2,300 sq mi), which is thought by scientists to be the last remains of the massive Laurentide Ice sheet that covered most of Canada and a large portion of northern USA during the last ice age.\u00a0 In 2012, I scrambled to the end of the Niflheim glacier, which is very close to Thor, and the view just got incredible on the Ice cap such as Highway glacier.<\/p> <p><br\/>My research is all done and I could coordinate many aspects. Next summer, the best dates to go, weather wise, would be from August the 8th until the 29th when the river levels are usually lower.\u00a0At that time, the average temperature ranges between 4 and 10C or 39 and 50F.\u00a0 This is an arctic trip that is reasonably affordable, safe and logistically manageable as you can get there with scheduled flights and the Park maintains emergency shelters approximately every 10 kilometers where communications with the outside world is possible twice a day to call for help and to get weather forecasts.\u00a0 There are even a few food and gear caches if something really bad happen.\u00a0If you want to do some research, you can start at<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pc.gc.ca\/eng\/pn-np\/nu\/auyuittuq\/index.aspx\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pc.gc.ca\/eng\/pn-np\/nu\/auyuittuq\/index.aspx\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pc.gc.ca\/eng\/pn-np\/nu\/auyuittuq\/index.aspx<\/a><\/a> with the Visitor Information Package.<\/p> <p><br\/>The main risk is the crossing of the numerous glacier-fed rivers and it is possible that few crossings may have to be done very early in the day like 4 am.\u00a0 Regarding the polar bears, they are rarely entering the Park as they prefer to stay on the north coast of Baffin island.\u00a0 This latest point explains why we start from the north so that our Inuit outfitter can make sure that it is safe before unloading the boat.\u00a0 As well, once we get off the boat, we walk 5 km or 3 mi inland before camping and we carry bear bangers.<\/p> <p><br\/>The required budget could be as follows:<\/p> <p><br\/>1)\u00a0 Approximately 300$ for the Park entry and two boat rides.<\/p> <p>2) Accommodations costs can be avoided completely by camping in communities as hotels are, otherwise, very expensive. \u00a0This is what I am going to do.<\/p> <p>3) A budget for an extra boat ride could be nice while in Qikitarjuuaq as icebergs, polar bears, narwhals (a.k.a. the unicorn of the sea by Jules Verne), walrus, belugas, orcas and bow whales can be seen.\u00a0 FYI, this community is often called the iceberg capital of the world since it is facing Greenland and this is the coast that all Greenland icebergs follow before going down to melt in the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p> <p>4) Lightweight dry food for 3 weeks.<\/p> <p>5) The most expensive thing is the airfare.\u00a0 For example,\u00a0the return flight from Ottawa is approximately \u00a03000$ Canadian (First Air and Canadian North fly, via Iqaluit, to Qikitarjuuaq, the departure community, as well as Pangnitung, the arriving community) but it is still a lot cheaper than other arctic trip as you don\u2019t need to add the cost of a charter plane.\u00a0 I also know some cheaper options provided that booking is done enough in advance.\u00a0 If you are very interested and the airfare cost is the only issue, we could talk about this specifically.<\/p> <p>As the packs would be very heavy (approximately 35 kg or 75 pounds), a few weather-bound days are to be expected and well-though planning for 3 weeks of autonomy respecting food and gears is critical, the composition of the group is very important.\u00a0 It is therefore important that interested persons be able to do at least one short group activity over the next few months, most likely in the New York State\u2019s Adirondacks, in order to make sure that participants are compatible, capable, well equipped and fit enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>I am experienced, well-organized, mature, tall and fit.\u00a0 In addition to my personal gear, I have a very light 2 person winter tent that can stand the possible katabatic winds.<\/p> <p>If others are interested, we could also bring some gears for glacier travel so some of us can go camping on the glacier at the foot of Asgard \u00a0(i.e., Turner glacier for 6 km or 4 mi one-way).\u00a0 As well, climbing gears could be brought so some of us in order to climb Thor on the less technical routes (i.e., the \u201cstandard\u201d route thru East Face\/North Ridge which has 3 pitches of 5.7 near the top or, alternatively, the route over the South Ridge which is mostly four class with the last 300 m or 100 ft been fifth class with one short section of 5.8 or 5.9).<\/p> <p><br\/>If you are interested, the next steps would be to participate into a group discussion on Skype at 6:45 pm (Eastern Time) on Wednesday September 23rd.\u00a0 In order to participate in the call, please send me an e-mail (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>) with your skype id as well as your weight and height with a description of your relevant experience for this trip (backpacking or other similar trip) and whether the airfare is an issue.\u00a0 If you are interested but can\u2019t make it that evening, this is not a problem but please let me know and send me the above information as I will arrange another group discussion in the following week starting on September 28th. As needed, other discussions would be arranged.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thanks<\/p> <p>Stephen from Ottawa, Canada<\/p> <p>++<\/p> <p><br\/>NOTE: You are responsible for bringing appropriate gear, supplies, clothing, first aid, and lights.

Googolplex ... Googolplexplex<br\/>This talk focuses on \"Canon,\" a Haskell library designed to represent massive numbers such as the above and to as efficiently (as possible) perform computations with them. It will cover the features and limitations of this new library, as well as the quick wins and frustrations encountered while developing it. Additionally, it will cover some of the\u00a0\u00a0math behind factoring numbers with algebraic forms\u00a0(e.g. cyclotomic polynomials, Aurifeuillean factorization, and soforth).<\/p> <p>Parallel Computation of Cryptographic Hash Functions, 8pm<br\/>by Prasad Rao (work with Stuart Haber)<\/p> <p>This talk is an exploration of some work in progress that resulted\u00a0 from an attempt to answer these questions: 1)\u00a0How to arrive at a multicore reference implementation of the Sakura tree hash mode? 2) How to enable communication of \"shape\" between the entity that computes a cryptographic tree hash with the verifier of this hash? 3) How well does this reference implementation scale w.r.t. the number of cores, sizes of inputs, and variety of shapes? \u00a04) How to do all this without becoming an expert on C++ parallel\u00a0 \u00a0 programming?<\/p> <p>This talk will be introductory and self-contained. \u00a0All we require of\u00a0 the audience is willingness and ability to read Haskell code.<\/p> <p>Extended Technical Notes:<\/p> <p>Wikipedia defines a cryptographic hash function as a hash function which is effectively impossible to invert, that is, to recreate the input data from its hash value alone. These functions have been called \"the workhorses of modern cryptography\" and\u00a0have many information security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication of messages.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties: 1) it is easy to compute the hash value for any given input, 2) it is infeasible to generate a input from its hash value, 3) it is infeasible to modify a input without changing its hash value, and 4) it is infeasible to find two different inputs with the same hash value.<\/p> <p><br\/>The NIST announced a public competition in November 2007 to develop a new cryptographic hash algorithm, called SHA-3, for standardization. NIST announced Keccak as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition on October 2, 2012, and ended the five-year competition. The authors of Keccak also proposed a flexible, fairly general, encoding for tree hash modes, in order to enable the possibility to cleanly carry out sub-computations in parallel.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

We have two amazing models, Jenny who was a big hit at the last shoot and first time modeling for us is beauty Noel.<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>With Halloween around the corner, we wanted to continue the \"costume\" theme but with a glamour twist. (We'll have more of a Halloween theme next month with props and working on a dry ice setup with some edgy lighting.) So, for this shoot the ladies will be dressed in sexy \"costumes\" with a lingerie\/glamour styling. We've been lucky with the weather so far and if fortunate again, we'll do some outdoor shooting as the last days of summer wind down. Indoors, we'll continue with the pinup setups and glamour lighting.<\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p>(Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge)<\/p> <p>(Non-Commercial Release provided onsite or PDF version to email registered upon check-in.)<\/p> <p><b>Models:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Noel Moore: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelmayhem.com\/3468111\">MM#[masked]<\/a>\u00a0- <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/noely1224\">Instagram<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Photos provided by model for promotional purposes only.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/225385922\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Pre-Halloween Glamour Shoot w\/Noel & Jenny - Sept. 23rd","id":"225385922","time":1443049200000,"updated":1443061281000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":5,"distance":10.5748910904,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435248930000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bring your UAV \/ sUAS Drones to our regular monthly <i><b>Hoboken Build and Configure<\/b><\/i>...

He also composed throughout his career for clarinet.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/e\/b\/600_442300171.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nRick Bogart worked in New Orleans during the \"heyday\" of the French Quarter during the mid 1970s within the first five blocks of Bourbon Street. At that time, there were fifteen full-time Jazz bands along those blocks. During this time he played in the bands of Snookum Russell and Wallace Davenport at the Paddock Lounge, and with June Gardner, Nick Gagliardi, Milton Ziedrich and Thomas Jefferson at the Famous Door. Bogart later moved to New York City to refine and broaden his style. He played in Atlantic City, Cleveland, New York City, Miami, and touring the world headlining on cruise ships for decades. He has written songs for major movies produced for HBO and is the subject of the documentary When the Clarinet Swings. He is most closely aligned with his New Orleans and Swing-style background. However, he has broadened his style over the course of his career by living and working in New York, and working with many musicians of varying styles around the world. In the words of Danny Stiles of WNYC Radio, \"One of the great clarinetists of our era.\"<\/p> <p>Amayah Bellydancing: Amayah is a dancer who has learned both traditional middle eastern and more contemporary styles of belly dance. She currently lives and dances in New York City, performing as a resident dancer at Tagine Moroccan Restaurant in Midtown, and is also a member of Columbia Belly Dance at Columbia University, where she is a Masters student in the Clinical Psychology program. Amayah is of multiracial descent and grew up in the New York\/New Jersey metro area, where she started dancing at a very young age. Beginning with ballet, modern, jazz, hip hop and even west african dance, she was drawn to belly dance when she started as a freshman in her undergraduate years at Rutgers. She auditioned and joined the Rutgers belly dance troupe in fall 2009, and the following year became their dance coach for the next three years, choreographing the troupe pieces. Amayah was primarily taught in American cabaret, modern Egyptian, classical Egyptian (raqs sharqi, raqs beledi, and raqs shaabi), and tribal fusion styles, but is always learning new styles and advancing her technique. She is very grateful to all of her amazing teachers who have influenced and inspired her over the years.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/f\/3\/600_442300179.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nTo book a table call[masked] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.taginedining.com\">www.taginedining.com<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Happy-Hour-Meetup\/events\/225567286\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Jazz Night with Rick Bogart and Bellydancing by Amayah!","id":"225567286","time":1443052800000,"updated":1443064996000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427750247000,"name":"New York Happy Hour Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18526728,"urlname":"New-York-City-Happy-Hour-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"happy hour lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York City","address_1":"221 West 38th Street ","name":"Tagine","lon":-73.989494,"id":18895822,"state":"NY","lat":40.754055,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.281905472279,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443040472000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tonight we have a special bellydance event with Rick Bogart Jazz Trio.

Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.

Channeled by the same voice that authored ACIM but in more easy to understand language, Mari Perron's <i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> speaks to the heart rather than the mind. Let's explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week, taking breaks whenever Yasuko is away teaching in Japan (usually November, March and July).<\/p> <p>It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.
