WEG ZUM GL\u00dcCKLICHEN UND VERANTWORTUNGSVOLLEN MENSCHEN<\/b><\/p> <p>Es ist das Ziel aller Eltern, ihr Kind darin zu unterst\u00fctzen, ein gl\u00fccklicher und verantwortungsvoller Mensch zu werden, der die Herausforderungen des Lebens erfolgreich meistert und erf\u00fcllende Beziehungen hat. Die Grundsteine f\u00fcr eine solch positive Entwicklung werden schon ab den ersten Wochen gelegt. Es ist ein anspruchsvolles \u2013 und doch m\u00f6gliches \u2013 Ziel!<\/p> <p>Wir zeigen Erziehungspraktiken, die auf den Prinzipien der Bindungstheorie aufbauen. Diese Praktiken erf\u00fcllen auf der einen Seite das nat\u00fcrliche Bed\u00fcrfnis des Kindes nach Vertrauen und Bindung, und auf der anderen Seite den Drang, seine Umgebung und die Welt zu erkunden. Die Bildung stabiler und gesunder Beziehungen zwischen Ihnen und Ihrem Kind\/Ihren Kindern ist die Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr, dass die Kinder als Erwachsene solide und zufriedenstellende Beziehungen aufbauen und erhalten k\u00f6nnen, und zwar sowohl im privaten als auch im beruflichen Leben.<\/p> <p>Wir werden die folgenden Fragen diskutieren und sie auf Ihren Alltag und Ihre Erfahrung als Eltern beziehen:<\/p> <p>1.) Was bedeutet Bindung und wieso ist sie so wichtig?<br\/>2.) Wie Sie Ihrem Kind eine sichere Basis geben k\u00f6nnen, von der es seine n\u00e4here und weitere Umgebung erkunden kann.<br\/>3.) Wie Sie die Balance halten k\u00f6nnen zwischen emotionaler Bindung und Struktur und Grenzen setzen.<br\/>4.) Wie Sie verstehen k\u00f6nnen, was Ihnen Ihr Kind sagen will.<br\/>5.) Wie Sie Ihrem Kind ein gutes Vorbild zum Aufbau und Erhalt von stabilen Beziehungen sein k\u00f6nnen.<br\/>6.) Unterschiedliche Bindungsstile: Wie sehen diese aus und was bedeuten sie f\u00fcr die Entwicklung Ihres Kindes und dessen Anpassungs- und Durchsetzungsf\u00e4higkeit im Leben.<br\/>7.) Was, wenn Sie einen Fehler machen? \u2013 Es gibt keine perfekten Eltern, oder generell perfekte Menschen. Es ist die Art, wie wir Br\u00fcche in unseren Beziehungen reparieren, die den Unterschied ausmacht. Wie also k\u00f6nnen wir die momentanen Br\u00fcche reparieren?<\/p> <p>Wir werden diese Fragen und Themen auf verschiedene Altersgruppen beziehen und darauf ausrichten, wie Sie Ihr Kind am besten dahingehend unterst\u00fctzen koennen, die bestm\u00f6gliche emotional und soziale Entwicklung zu durchlaufen.<\/p> <p><b>Tuition:<\/b><br\/>$39 per Person<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/seminar-resilient-kids-grundsteine-erfolgreicher-erziehung-tickets-22230120890\"><b>Register here:<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><b>THIS SEMINAR IS HELD IN GERMAN<\/b><\/p> <p>(This seminar is periodically held in English with the title: Successful Parenting - Raising Happy &amp; Resilient Kids)<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p>Dr.\u00a0Kraemer\u00a0is a clinical psychologist, licensed in the State of New York. \u00a0She has a psychotherapy practice, with an emphasis on\u00a0aspects of the parent-child-relationship (Parenting At Its Best),\u00a0issues around aging (Aging At Its\u00a0Best), as well as the relationship\u00a0between eating behavior and one\u2019s own body.\u00a0Dr. Kraemer\u00a0also serves as part time faculty\u00a0at The New School for Public Engagement. \u00a0Additionally, she is an internationally sought after instructor\u00a0at various professional development schools and institutes.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group\/events\/229130074\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":4500000,"name":"Resilient Kids - Grundsteine erfolgreicher Erziehung","id":"229130074","time":1457709300000,"updated":1457715634000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1325706674000,"name":"CityKinder Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3044732,"urlname":"CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chatham","address_1":"368 Main Street","name":"Postpartum Place","lon":-74.387444,"id":21942542,"state":"NJ","lat":40.742218,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.8541469574,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441985573000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open to pregnant moms and those with babies under 1 yrwho are suffering from postpartum depression or an anxiety disorder or those who are not sure and want more info - Babies welcome!<\/p> <p>Water and snacks provided.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"across from Valley National Bank, next to Gulf Station- Blue house set back","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Moms-Mini-Circle\/events\/227361708\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Come and join an informative discussion about Perinatal Mood Disorders","id":"bntqklyvfbpb","time":1457710200000,"updated":1457722883000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1343993855000,"name":"Exploring PMAD- Monthly Support Group","group_lon":-74.4000015259,"id":4457982,"urlname":"Moms-Mini-Circle","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10314","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Staten Island","address_1":"2329 Victory Blvd","lon":-74.141939,"phone":"718-698-1338","name":"All Saints Episcopal Church","id":1463623,"state":"NY","lat":40.611709,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.4622678757,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1315576066000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Classes are created for those with physical disabilities, aliments, recovering from surgery, Seniors OR who are seeking a gentle practice to restore the body and mind.<br\/>Classes will include poses and methods that will allow students to increase muscular strength, endurance, flexibility as well as stamina, lung capacity and overall wellness.

You'll have a chance to team up with others and set out through the halls of the museum looking for clues to answer questions and take picture challenges. The group will meet at The Old Castle Tavern for cocktails between 6PM and 6:30 PM. Upon check-in we will group people together into teams Bring your camera!<\/p> <p>WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR AT THE MUSEUM:<br\/>All The Clues are things that are already at the museum. It is in the paintings, sculptures, gift shops, hallways, signs and the people who are there. Each team will have 75 minutes to find as many clues as possible.

Slackbot, and Facebook M are two early examples of conversational bots that also use Artificial Intelligence to respond, learn and accumulate information from a community.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bots are also a personnel multiplier, as they can respond to repetitive but necessary interactions, like product inquries (FAQs), company culture onboarding, and daily standup meetings\/<\/p> <p>The Closers cohort will present BOTSERVER, a technology for choosing and implementing different types of bots into a Slack environment. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Additionally, we will also demonstrate a few bots of our creation, including Super_Kei (a FAQ-responding bot) and AZIZ_bot (an AI-powered conversation tone analyzer, that uses the IBM Watson AI API to determine stress, anger, happines and fear in an IM conversation and respond accordingly). \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Closers won the top prize in the recent (Feb 19, 2016) Stamford (CT) Hackathon 2.0. \u00a0They chose the Artificial Intelligence track using the IBM Watson API.<\/p> <p>* Now that the coding bootcamp grind is over, \u00a0FinTech.O! meetups resume next month, April 8th. \u00a0 We have a great lineup of speakers for you.

It then spread to southernChina during the Song Dynasty and was further established during the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty.[1] In time, regional variations developed with different ingredients such as seafood. By the Qing Dynasty (AD 1644 to 1912), the hot pot became popular throughout most of China. Today in many modern homes, particularly in larger cities, the traditional coal-heated steamboat or hot pot has been replaced by electric, propane, butane gas, orinduction cooker versionsa<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/6\/a\/600_447228234.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/229135893\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":7200000,"name":"All you can eat Hot Pot @ 99 Favor Taste","id":"229135893","time":1457739000000,"updated":1457835506000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

It's one of the most visually attractive spaces in the City, and possesses an atmosphere that just puts you in the mood to be entertained. The artists are always amazing- featuring either up and coming acts or those who've made it and want to play a more intimate venue. Even the crowd that attends usually adds something special by interacting with the artist to create an involved listening experience. And best of all, It's free. Yep, I said it- 100% free. You can't beat that with a stick. Or maybe you can. I don't know- I'm not that familiar with sticks. Anyway, If you want to enjoy good music with good company, all in an amazing space, join us at BAMcafe.<\/p> <p>Here's some info about the artist from the BAMcafe website:<\/p> <p><i>This acclaimed, forward-thinking string quartet has been shaking up the city\u2019s classical music scene, emphasizing a repertoire of new works by emerging artists. PUBLIQuartet showcases daring contemporary pieces and original compositions that incorporate jazz, world music, and electronic influences. Fresh from their sold-out debut at Carnegie Hall, they take the stage at BAMcaf\u00e9 for a genre-busting evening of cutting-edge classical music.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0I recommend you check out their website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publiquartet.com\">here<\/a>, and listen to some of their songs to get an idea of this unique and interesting group- and to get an idea why I'm excited for their performance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One last thing to keep in mind, the space isn't tiny, but it has been known to fill up quickly in the past. Getting there on time or even a little early goes a long way toward not standing while you enjoy the show. I'll get there early and try to save as many seats as possible, but some help with that would be appreciated.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/229310168\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"name":"BAMcafe: PUBLIQuartet","id":"229310168","time":1457744400000,"updated":1457756209000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"67 Irving Place, 2nd Floor","name":"Atmananda Yoga Sequence","lon":-73.986969,"id":13022592,"state":"NY","lat":40.736664,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.93684720993,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445015253000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please join us for our weekly gathering!<\/p> <p>Please enter the space quietly so\u00a0that we can support the meditation of the prior class in session.

Signature Evans works are performed and Joel plays pieces he enjoys that show the Evans influence. Highlighted is the collaboration of Bill Evans &amp; Tony Bennett during 1975 and \u201877, which yielded some of the best recordings in the history of jazz.<\/p> <p>Few listeners realized that Tony Bennett was as much of a jazz singer as almost anybody; he had already made a handful of albums in a small jazz combo format, but these were far lesser known than his big chart hits. Then, in 1975, he made what would be his supreme statement in the jazz field, the first of two albums with the remarkable pianist Bill Evans.<\/p> <p>Joel had the great fortune of playing at the Top of the Gate in NYC during the mid 60\u2019s, on Monday nights. It was on these Mondays that he split sets with the Bill Evans Trio, and his greatness has stayed with Joel right up to the present. They reprise this remarkable collaboration of American Art Song at its finest, by recapturing the virility and expressiveness in these performances. It is a beautiful surprising repertoire \u2013 no Gershwin, no Ellington, no blues. They\u2019re mostly songs associated with great female singers: Mabel Mercer and Billie Holiday, as well as Bill Evans\u2019 own \u201cWaltz For Debby\u201d with Gene Lees\u2019 lyrics.<br\/>Annette is a Grammy nominee with 5 CDs, has sung with Benny Goodman, Mel Torme, Antonio Carlos Jobim. She was the featured vocalist in Dick Hyman\u2019s Jazz Series at the 92nd St. Y, and also performed in The Billy Taylor Jazz Series at Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Her distinctive recognizable sound has been heard on thousands of jingles, movie sound tracks, and CD\u2019s.<br\/>Please visit website for video, bio, music, press and more: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelzelnik.com\">www.joelzelnik.com<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AllThatJazz-NJ-Rockland-NYC-Live-Events-Meetup\/events\/228983926\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Hear The Joel Zelnik Trio with Annette Sanders","id":"228983926","time":1457744400000,"updated":1457756172000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1414982981000,"name":"All That Jazz: Live Jazz Events & More","group_lon":-74.1999969482,"id":18029782,"urlname":"AllThatJazz-NJ-Rockland-NYC-Live-Events-Meetup","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Jazz\/Live Music Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Iselin","address_1":"120 Wood Avenue South","name":"Hotel Woodbridge at Metro Park Fomerly -Woodbridge Hilton","lon":-74.325836,"id":22205412,"state":"NJ","lat":40.56192,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.9253139496,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457131131000,"fee":{"amount":17,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Steppin\u2019 Out Singles Friday Night Dance Party<br\/>Friday\u00a0March 11th 8:30PM til 12:30AM\u00a0<br\/>APA Woodbridge Hotel<br\/>120 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, NJ 08830<br\/>GSP Exit 131\u3000\u3000\u3000Directions\u3000[masked]<br\/>Steppin' Out Singles offers singles dances in NJ in a classy atmosphere featuring the Best DJs in NJ.

What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good.

Three years late for their first period, they spend their time staging gruesome death scenes for their own amusement, amidst the willful ignorance of their relentlessly perky mother (Mimi Rogers). On the night Ginger finally gets her period, the sisters are attacked in the woods by a ferocious creature that may have some connection to \"The Beast of Bailey Downs,\" a predator currently disemboweling its way through the local dog population. The girls survive the attack, and Ginger's wounds heal quickly, but her attitude grows even more bizarre, as hair sprouts from her scars and a tail grows from her spine. Adding to the terror, she starts dating boys. A panicked Brigitte forces herself to befriend Sam (Kris Lemche), the high school pot supplier, whose brand of ganja may be the only cure for Ginger's troubling ailment.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zoa1A987A_k\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zoa1A987A_k<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet at the upstairs bar\/ticket counter","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/229348006\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Ginger Snaps 35mm film print midnight movie","id":"229348006","time":1457757000000,"updated":1457768869000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"131 W 3rd St","name":"Blue Note","lon":-74.000732,"id":23934579,"lat":40.730728,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.44846892357,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454956613000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are invited to join us again for another smooth evening of Jazz at the historic <b>Blue Note Jazz Club<\/b>, in downtown Manhattan!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/3\/600_439263587.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nOur NYBL Meetup Group with get together to enjoy a Jazz set at the Blue Note by musician <b>Maurico de Souza<\/b>!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/0\/600_439263520.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Born in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, Maur\u00edcio de Souza is a jazz drummer who easily performs in both traditional jazz and Brazilian jazz styles.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?\u00a0<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?\u00a0<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?\u00a0<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?\u00a0<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

The first leg is from Mount Peter in Warwick to Arden (roughly 11 miles) and is scheduled on 3\/12 (Sat). The second leg is from Arden to Jones Point (roughly 18 miles) and is scheduled on 4\/9 (Sat). This hike is not designed for the beginners who have never navigated themselves in the woods using maps and a compass or GPS. All the participants are expected to be independent and self-sufficient, as the group will walk at his or her own pace without a sweep. The group will meet at NJ Transit ticket counters at Port Authority Bus Terminal at 08:10 and take NJ Transit Bus #197 departing PABT at 08:30 to Mt. Peter (AMC Transportation Code: 3G). The bus will stop at the junction of 17A and Kain Road ONLY upon your request. It is scheduled for arrival at 09:20. The hike will begin at 09:30. We'll wrap up the 11-mile hike by 14:00, which would return the average pace of 2.44 miles\/hour, including breaks, and catch the Coach USA Shortline bus from Arden (AMC Transportation Code: 1F) at 14:18 back to PABT at 15:33.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0103rd Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

It's responding to the rhythm, attitude, or story of the music you're hearing. In short, it's having a dance party in your living room, while walking through the park--hilarious and exhilarating.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

We've explored the breath, the body, our emotions and our thoughts and thinking. These different objects of meditation give us the sensory entry points we can use to find a deeper understanding of the mind.<\/p> <p>This week we'll move on and take a mindful look at the mind and mind states. We consider these each time we look at what mind state or mood we bring to the meditation cushion. And, of course, our state of mind has a great deal of influence over how we approach life both on and off of the cushion.<\/p> <p>Traditionally, the teachings around mind begin with the examination of three root mind states that interfere with being fully aware and \"clearly knowing.\" Is our mind state rooted in greed or desire; is our mind state rooted in hatred or anger; or, is our mind state rooted in delusion or ignorance or confusion?<\/p> <p>The teachings let us know the importance of\u00a0learning both when the three mind states are present and when they aren't. If greed or desire is not present, do we know generosity; if anger is not present, do we know kindness; and, if delusion is not present, do we know wisdom?<\/p> <p>Clear knowing of both aspects of these root states is how we tell the difference between skillful and unskillful actions in our lives.\u00a0 It deepens our understanding of what leads to happiness and freedom and what leads to suffering and dissatisfaction.<\/p> <p>Class <b>Structure<\/b>: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation. There is time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Fee by donation<\/i><i>: Suggested starting donation is $10 and your generosity is greatly appreciated. \u00a0No one is ever turned away for lack of funds. \u00a0The donation box is on the sign-in table.<\/i><\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Foundations of Mindfulness - Introduction<\/b> Mindfulness is more than just paying attention. It is powered by intention, but we also have to get out of our own way to experience clearly what\u2019s actually appearing. We have to find an openness of heart and mind and suspend our judgements and theories and rationales so we can see more than what we always see. We have to begin to relinquish the \"I\" and \"mine\" kinds of ownership over what arises in our experience. We also have to unhook from the time line that may bind us to the past or project us to the future and be mindful now.<\/p> <p>Over the next few weeks we will explore of the traditional Foundations of Mindfulness.<\/p> <p>Introduction to Mindfulness<br\/>Mindfulness of the Breath<br\/>Mindfulness of the Body<br\/>Mindfulness of Emotions<br\/>Mindfulness of Thinking<br\/>Mindfulness of the Mind<br\/>Mindfulness in Daily Life<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meditation-and-Mindfulness-in-Bay-Ridge\/events\/228197757\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":4500000,"name":"Foundations of Mindfulness - The Mind","id":"qsqbplyvfbhb","time":1457798400000,"updated":1457920103000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430952109000,"name":"Meditation and Mindfulness in Bay Ridge","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":18579743,"urlname":"Meditation-and-Mindfulness-in-Bay-Ridge","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11211","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"415 Grand Street","name":"Empire of the Dog","lon":-73.953804,"id":1594092,"state":"NY","lat":40.711872,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.25185823441,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452296869000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/8\/event_188040472.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>SMALL DOG MEETUP for Dogs under 20 lbs!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>FREE FREE FREE<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BABY It's [getting] COLD OUTSIDE!!<\/b><br\/>Bring IN your small dog for some socialization despite the weather!

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and dashing good looks, Grant is considered one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men\"\u00a0 - and yet, he never won an Oscar. We think he deserved one. From light-hearted comedy to more serious roles, Grant did it all. Two of Cary Grant's most fun roles were in the comedies Bringing Up Baby and Arsenic and Old Lace.<\/p> <p>Bringing Up Baby (1938) is one of versatile director Howard Hawks' greatest screwball comedies and often considered the definitive screwball film. It is also one of the funniest, wackiest and most inspired films of all time with its characteristic breathless pace, zany antics and pratfalls, absurd situations and misunderstandings, perfect sense of comic timing, completely screwball cast, series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures, disasters, light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy. The non-stop, harum-scarum farce skewered many institutions, including psychiatry, the sterile field of science, the police, and high-society upper classes.<\/p> <p>Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) is a frenzied, hilarious, madcap black comedy from celebrated director Frank Capra. The slapstick film, with murderous aunts compassionately serving up elderberry wine to elderly gentlemen - with their crazy nephew assisting by burying the unfortunate victims, is unlike most of the other reform-minded Capra-corn films with a social conscience that became his trademark, e.g., Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). It is more similar in tone to his screwball romantic comedy It Happened One Night (1934) and to Capra's other adaptation from a Broadway play You Can't Take It With You (1938). Cary Grant does a marvelous job of exaggerated acting with constant mugging and other facial plasticity, amazing double-takes, slapstick and general befuddlement.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Library viewing room, lower level","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-fiction-society-northern-nj\/events\/227726361\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":16200000,"name":"FTF: Cary Grant double-feature Bringing Up Baby & Arsenic and Old Lace","id":"dcnwcfyvfbqb","time":1457803800000,"updated":1457992603000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1233007408000,"name":"The Science Fiction Society of Northern New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1367789,"urlname":"science-fiction-society-northern-nj","group_lat":41.0699996948,"who":"SF\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Astoria","address_1":"1945 49th St","name":"Astoria Bowl","lon":-73.894867,"id":23795931,"lat":40.773289,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":5.24276065826,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426774394000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a rejection\/bowling party!

Take the 11:22 am Coach USA\/Rockland Coaches bus from Port Authority, and meet in front of Bunbury's Coffee Shop (460 Piermont Avenue) at 12:30. Please register by email with the leader ([masked] or via meetup mail) and wait for a response saying that you are included in the hike.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/229417675\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"A Piermont Perambulation (2B5)","id":"229417675","time":1457803800000,"updated":1457835781000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351543614000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club New York-North Jersey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":5616472,"urlname":"Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"AMC Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"150 Bay St, Suite 909","name":" Michelle Timek Yoga ","lon":-74.039948,"id":24377131,"state":"NJ","lat":40.721024,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":3.30019044876,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455891039000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/0\/600_447002512.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Holistic-Parents-Hudson-County\/events\/228972850\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Essential Oils for Women, Pregnancy & Family","id":"228972850","time":1457803800000,"updated":1457817286000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1333386533000,"name":"Holistic Parents of Hudson County","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":3592492,"urlname":"Holistic-Parents-Hudson-County","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Conscious Choice Parents"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10468","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bronx","address_1":"2530 Jerome Avenue, Bronx ","name":"St. James Recreation Center","lon":-73.89917,"id":6570882,"state":"NY","lat":40.864719,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":9.25935554504,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1384452636000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>FREE ZUMBA CLASSES.

This month we're reading <i>A Head Full of Ghosts <\/i>by Paul Tremblay:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>A chilling thriller that brilliantly blends domestic drama, psychological suspense, and a touch of modern horror, reminiscent of Mark Z. Danielewski\u2019s House of Leaves, John Ajvide Lindqvist\u2019s Let the Right One In, and Shirley Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>To her parents\u2019 despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie\u2019s descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts\u2019 plight. With John, Marjorie\u2019s father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i>Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie\u2019s younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface\u2014and a mind-bending tale\u00a0<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p>Come hang out, talk stories, and help us pick the next books.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are usually seated in the back.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror\/events\/228930488\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay","id":"228930488","time":1457809200000,"updated":1457821056000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402509345000,"name":"Genre Book Club (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":15026732,"urlname":"Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newark","address_1":"165 Mulberry St, Newark, NJ ","name":"The Prudential Center","lon":0,"id":23646114,"state":"NJ","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453341234000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/9\/a\/event_89835002.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>*Shooting animals to death when the intense, unnatural confinement causes them to engage in aggressive or self destructive, stereotypical behaviors<\/p> <p>*Continuously\/routinely inflicting painful punishments on animals who do not perform under a diabolical mixture of stress, fear and deprivation of all that is natural, as \"necessary\" to keep the animals obedient, the crowds entertained and the million$$$ rolling in.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/c\/a\/event_89839402.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>*Cynically scoffing in the face of USDA *minimal* requirements of animal welfare, including adequate veterinary care, reasonable opportunities to engage in natural behaviors, sufficient space, exercise and drinking water.<\/p> <p>The atrocities go on and on and on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/circusprotest.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circusprotest.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circusprotest.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mRZt6SdNs7g\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mRZt6SdNs7g\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mRZt6SdNs7g<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Y6WKI8eKI4\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Y6WKI8eKI4\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Y6WKI8eKI4<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.peta.org\/issues\/animals-in-entertainment\/circuses.aspx\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.peta.org\/issues\/animals-in-entertainment\/circuses.aspx\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.peta.org\/issues\/animals-in-entertainment\/circuses.aspx<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the details of the\u00a0anti-Ringling demonstration:<\/p> <p>WHERE: Ringling's 3 Ring Circus of Horror and Atrocity<\/p> <p>The Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, NJ, 07102\u00a0<\/p> <p>WHEN: Saturday March 12, 2016<\/p> <p>TIME: 2:00-4:00 pm<\/p> <p>ASSEMBLY POINT: The corner of Lafayette &amp; Mulberry Streets in the Ironbound Section of Newark, right outside the Prudential Center (see below map:)<br\/>MAP: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapquest.com\/?version=1.0&amp;hk=8-88kqUwFN\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapquest.com\/?version=1.0&amp;hk=8-88kqUwFN\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mapquest.com\/?version=1.0&amp;hk=8-88kqUwFN<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: from NYC -Penn Station in NYC, one train stop\u00a0to Newark\u00a0Penn Station.

Her blind panic at her first menstruation, a result of ignorance and religious guilt drummed into her by her fanatical mother, Margaret (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/piper-laurie-p40813\">Piper Laurie<\/a>), only causes her classmates' vicious cruelty to escalate, despite the attentions of her overly solicitous gym teacher (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/betty-buckley-p9345\">Betty Buckley<\/a>). Finally, when the venomous Chris Hargenson (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/nancy-allen-p1046\">Nancy Allen<\/a>) engineers a reprehensible prank at the school prom, Carrie lashes out in a horrifying display of her heretofore minor telekinetic powers. Many films had featured school bullies, but Carrie was one of the first to focus on the special brand of cruelty unique to teenage girls. Carrie's world is presented as a snake pit, where the well-to-do female students all have fangs -- even the reticent Sue Snell (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/amy-irving-p34559\">Amy Irving<\/a>) -- and all the males are blind pawns, sexually twisted around the fingers of Chris and her evil cronies. The talented supporting cast includes\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/john-travolta-p71670\">John Travolta<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/pj-soles-p66807\">P.J. Soles<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/william-katt-p37064\">William Katt<\/a>.

Young women from the Kadam Education Initiative have been invited by LitWorld (a US NGO that supports Kadam Education Initiative) to participate in a series of events for girls organized in connection with the UN Women - CSW Summits in NYC in March 2016. As a welcome to, and in support of KEI, AID NYC will host the group of organizers and young female students ranging between 14 and 21 years old. The event is a roundtable discussion bringing together KEI, AID NYC and New York based organizations who are working to drive successful change within the field of education. The purpose of this event is to provide a unique opportunity for an in-depth exchange between similarly dedicated peoples while KEI is visiting the U.S. This gathering emphasizes networking through discussion; a moderator will facilitate participating speakers as they sit around a dynamic table layout, as well as using this intimate setting to involve any audience. -----------<\/p> <p>Association for India's Development (AID) is a volunteer based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization committed to promoting sustainable, equitable and just development.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

It was built behind high walls , its stained-glass windows designed to be outside the reach of rock-throwing from the sidewalk. The Ancient Order of Hibernians squared off against the Know Nothings to protect the Church many times in its early years. And they succeeded, though the original building was damaged by fire in 1866, only to be restored in 1868.<\/p> <p>The parish was largely financed by and originally catered to working-class Irish immigrants, despite its proximity to what we now know as Little Italy. Italian immigrants arrived in the 1880s, followed by Chinese and Hispanic immigrants.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for over fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

This move was very unfortunate for Bank of America.<\/p> <p>November 2007: Charles Prince, CEO of Citigroup, resigns in disgrace after very poor performance of Citi due to excessive exposure to poorly performing subprime loans. He is replaced by Vikram Pandit.<\/p> <p>March 2008: Bear Stearns fails due to excessive exposure to defaulting subprime loans and is rescued by JP Morgan Chase with help from the government.<\/p> <p>Sept 14, 2008: Merrill Lynch, an investment bank failing due to excessive exposure to subprime loans, agrees to be acquired by Bank of America, a transaction which was completed in January 2009.<\/p> <p>Note that the financial crisis would have been worse had Glass-Steagall not been repealed, because it would have prevented the rescues of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch.<\/p> <p>Sept 2008: Lehman Brothers is on the verge of bankruptcy. Over the preceding months, several other banks had considered rescuing \/ acquiring it, but all backed after a closer look at the assets, seeing just how bad they were. The Fed and Treasury try desperately to save it, but they don\u2019t have the legal authority to outright bail it out, and on Sept 15, 2008, Lehman declares bankruptcy.<\/p> <p>Late September 2008: After the failure of Lehman, financial panic freezes credit markets. Hank Paulson (Secretary of the Treasury) and Ben Bernanke (Fed Chairman) approach congress asking for permission to use $[masked] billion to bail out the banks. The first question they were asked is \u201cCan\u2019t this wait until after the election?\u201d (the election was scheduled for the beginning of November). Bernanke stresses that credit markets are frozen, banks aren\u2019t lending to each other, let alone anybody else, and normal companies cannot get the routine loans they need to stay in business.<\/p> <p>September[masked]: The House of Representatives rejects the bailout; stock markets crash.<\/p> <p>Oct 1, 2008: The Senate passes an amended bailout proposal and the House passes it on October 3. President Bush immediately signs it into law.<\/p> <p>An important feature of the bailouts is that all banks have to be bailed out, whether they need it or not, and whether their management wants it or not. Otherwise those banks that get bailed out could be stigmatized and experience runs. Banks that refuse to take the money are threatened by the government with dire regulatory harassment unless they relent, so that all the banks eventually agree to take the money.<\/p> <p>The banks are prohibited from paying back the bailout money until the government gives them permission, and they are prohibited from issuing their employees large bonuses until they pay back the bailout money. Somehow AIG (not a bank) finds a loophole in this and issues large bonuses in spite of still owing a very large amount of TARP money.<\/p> <p>The government takes over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest two bailouts of all.\u00a0 The government really had no choice but to bail them out, as those two entities were created by the government, and their whole purpose for existence revolves around an implicit government guarantee that, if push comes to shove, they will be bailed out by the Federal government.<\/p> <p>In the spring of 2009, the government conducts accounting \u201cstress tests\u201d to see if the banks can weather another storm. Those who pass the stress tests are to be permitted to pay back the bailout money, which most of the big banks do immediately, in early June 2009.

This move was very unfortunate for Bank of America.<\/p> <p>November 2007: Charles Prince, CEO of Citigroup, resigns in disgrace after very poor performance of Citi due to excessive exposure to poorly performing subprime loans. He is replaced by Vikram Pandit.<\/p> <p>March 2008: Bear Stearns fails due to excessive exposure to defaulting subprime loans and is rescued by JP Morgan Chase with help from the government.<\/p> <p>Sept 14, 2008: Merrill Lynch, an investment bank failing due to excessive exposure to subprime loans, agrees to be acquired by Bank of America, a transaction which was completed in January 2009.<\/p> <p>Note that the financial crisis would have been worse had Glass-Steagall not been repealed, because it would have prevented the rescues of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch.<\/p> <p>Sept 2008: Lehman Brothers is on the verge of bankruptcy. Over the preceding months, several other banks had considered rescuing \/ acquiring it, but all backed after a closer look at the assets, seeing just how bad they were. The Fed and Treasury try desperately to save it, but they don\u2019t have the legal authority to outright bail it out, and on Sept 15, 2008, Lehman declares bankruptcy.<\/p> <p>Late September 2008: After the failure of Lehman, financial panic freezes credit markets. Hank Paulson (Secretary of the Treasury) and Ben Bernanke (Fed Chairman) approach congress asking for permission to use $[masked] billion to bail out the banks. The first question they were asked is \u201cCan\u2019t this wait until after the election?\u201d (the election was scheduled for the beginning of November). Bernanke stresses that credit markets are frozen, banks aren\u2019t lending to each other, let alone anybody else, and normal companies cannot get the routine loans they need to stay in business.<\/p> <p>September[masked]: The House of Representatives rejects the bailout; stock markets crash.<\/p> <p>Oct 1, 2008: The Senate passes an amended bailout proposal and the House passes it on October 3. President Bush immediately signs it into law.<\/p> <p>An important feature of the bailouts is that all banks have to be bailed out, whether they need it or not, and whether their management wants it or not. Otherwise those banks that get bailed out could be stigmatized and experience runs. Banks that refuse to take the money are threatened by the government with dire regulatory harassment unless they relent, so that all the banks eventually agree to take the money.<\/p> <p>The banks are prohibited from paying back the bailout money until the government gives them permission, and they are prohibited from issuing their employees large bonuses until they pay back the bailout money. Somehow AIG (not a bank) finds a loophole in this and issues large bonuses in spite of still owing a very large amount of TARP money.<\/p> <p>The government takes over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest two bailouts of all.\u00a0 The government really had no choice but to bail them out, as those two entities were created by the government, and their whole purpose for existence revolves around an implicit government guarantee that, if push comes to shove, they will be bailed out by the Federal government.<\/p> <p>In the spring of 2009, the government conducts accounting \u201cstress tests\u201d to see if the banks can weather another storm. Those who pass the stress tests are to be permitted to pay back the bailout money, which most of the big banks do immediately, in early June 2009. Citigroup is still in bad shape, and Bank of America also is not fit to repay, mostly due to its unfortunate acquisition of other, far less healthy, banks. Many small banks are struggling and will remain unable to repay the bailout money for years, even until 2016.<\/p> <p>The repayment of the TARP money by most of the big banks in June of 2009 gets almost no media attention, being probably the most under covered event of the 21st century.<\/p> <p>Later in 2009, the banks that had repaid their TARP money issue bonuses to their employees.

He is replaced by Vikram Pandit.<\/p> <p>March 2008: Bear Stearns fails due to excessive exposure to defaulting subprime loans and is rescued by JP Morgan Chase with help from the government.<\/p> <p>Sept 14, 2008: Merrill Lynch, an investment bank failing due to excessive exposure to subprime loans, agrees to be acquired by Bank of America, a transaction which was completed in January 2009.<\/p> <p>Note that the financial crisis would have been worse had Glass-Steagall not been repealed, because it would have prevented the rescues of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sept 2008: Lehman Brothers is on the verge of bankruptcy. Over the preceding months, several other banks had considered rescuing \/ acquiring it, but all backed out\u00a0after a closer look at the assets, seeing just how bad they were.\u00a0 Lehman's CEO had been seriously out\u00a0of touch with reality regarding the value of\u00a0his firm's assets.\u00a0The Fed and Treasury try desperately to save it, but they don\u2019t have the legal authority to outright bail it out, and on Sept 15, 2008, Lehman declares bankruptcy.<\/p> <p>Late September 2008: After the failure of Lehman, financial panic freezes credit markets. Hank Paulson (Secretary of the Treasury) and Ben Bernanke (Fed Chairman) approach congress asking for permission to use $[masked] billion to bail out the banks. The first question they were asked is \u201cCan\u2019t this wait until after the election?\u201d (the election was scheduled for the beginning of November). Bernanke stresses that credit markets are frozen, banks aren\u2019t lending to each other, let alone anybody else, and normal companies cannot get the routine loans they need to stay in business.<\/p> <p>September[masked]: The House of Representatives rejects the bailout; stock markets crash.<\/p> <p>Oct 1, 2008: The Senate passes an amended bailout proposal and the House passes it on October 3. President Bush immediately signs it into law.<\/p> <p>An important feature of the bailouts is that all banks have to be bailed out, whether they need it or not, and whether their management wants it or not. Otherwise those banks that get bailed out could be stigmatized and experience runs. Banks that refuse to take the money are threatened by the government with dire regulatory harassment unless they relent, so that all the banks eventually agree to take the money.<\/p> <p>The banks are prohibited from paying back the bailout money until the government gives them permission, and they are prohibited from issuing their employees large bonuses until they pay back the bailout money. Somehow AIG (not a bank) finds a loophole in this and issues large bonuses in spite of still owing a very large amount of TARP money.<\/p> <p>The government takes over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest two bailouts of all.\u00a0 The government really had no choice but to bail them out, as those two entities were created by the government, and their whole purpose for existence revolves around an implicit government guarantee that, if push comes to shove, they will be bailed out by the Federal government.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the spring of 2009, the government conducts accounting \u201cstress tests\u201d to see if the banks can weather another storm. Those who pass the stress tests are to be permitted to pay back the bailout money, which most of the big banks do immediately, in early June 2009. Citigroup is still in bad shape, and Bank of America also is not fit to repay, mostly due to its unfortunate acquisition of other, far less healthy, banks. Many small banks are struggling and will remain unable to repay the bailout money for years, even until 2016.<\/p> <p>The repayment of the TARP money by most of the big banks in June of 2009 gets almost no media attention, being probably the most under covered event of the 21st century.<\/p> <p>Later in 2009, the banks that had repaid their TARP money issue bonuses to their employees. It should be noted that under normal conditions, a banker\u2019s bonus is a large part of their routine pay, so not issuing bonuses would be effectively a large pay cut. The public, believing that the TARP money has not been repaid and not understanding the normal nature of bankers\u2019 pay, is enraged.<\/p> <p>In September of 2009, \u201cCapitalism: A Love Story\u201d, a Michael Moore movie about the financial crisis, hits the theaters. In it, Michael Moore makes a big act of driving an armored truck around Manhattan to all the big banks demanding that they repay the TARP money. Bankers, knowing that anything intelligent that they say to him will wind up on the cutting room floor, refuse to interview him, and he never gets past the security guards. Whether we should believe that nobody ever told Moore that those banks had already repaid the money is left as an exercise for the reader.<\/p> <p>2011: Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders (a strange pair of bedfellows if ever I saw one) get legislation through congress dictating that the Fed is to be audited. The audit reveals that many short-term secret loans were made by the Fed during the crisis. In early 2009, these loans totalled $1.2 trillion, which was the peak outstanding. This was almost entirely paid back by January of 2010.<\/p> <p>Bernie Sanders, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sanders.senate.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/the-fed-audit\">on his website, to this date<\/a>, claims that his Fed audit revealed that $16 trillion in secret loans had happened and makes it sound like none of it has been paid back. To turn $1.2 trillion into $16 trillion, some accounting tricks are done. If I borrow $100 from you Thursday to be paid back in a week, and the next Thursday take out another $100, one-week loan to finance paying the first back, and then repeat the process every week for a year at which point I pay it off, Bernie Sanders\u2019 accounting would call that 52 x $100 == $5200 in loans. But it\u2019s paid back at the end of the year, and it was never more than $100. It was effectively a $100 loan for one year.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/0\/e\/600_447429230.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Above: the total outstanding debt of the allegedly $16 trillion (actual peak of $1.2 trillion) in loans exposed by the Fed audit.<\/p> <p>Most news sources, like Sanders, report the loans as $16 trillion, and insinuate that none of it has been repaid.<\/p> <p><br\/>2016: All the big banks and AIG have repaid their TARP money long ago.\u00a0 Fannie and Freddie have paid back.\u00a0 Some small banks still have yet to pay back.\u00a0 GM and Chrysler still owe bailout money.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front, and I'll have a sign on the table.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fans-of-Capitalism\/events\/228194134\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"2008 Financial Crisis and Bailouts: A Timeline","id":"228194134","time":1457823600000,"updated":1457842122000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1363455826000,"name":"Fans of Capitalism","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":7645202,"urlname":"Fans-of-Capitalism","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"520 8th Avenue","name":"Ripley-Grier Studios","lon":-73.991768,"id":15607412,"state":"NY","lat":40.753613,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.266807258129,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456671661000,"fee":{"amount":8,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>R&amp;B Line Dance Workshop in Midtown with the Empire Line Dancers<\/p> <p>Saturday, March 12, 2016<\/p> <p>Join in on the fun of line dancing.

You need a good sleeping bag rated to 10 degrees F or lower. In addition to a sleeping bag, you need a very good sleeping pad. It is important to have insulation between you and the ground. The filling in your sleeping bag that is underneath you will be compressed and provide no insulation. I highly recommend a sleeping pad with an R value of at least 5. (Hint: most closed cell foam pads have a 2.5 R value. If you double them up you will have a combined R value of 5.)<\/p> <p>You will also need something to keep the snow and wind off of you while you sleep. Since we're below the tree line, any small 3 season tent should do. You want something with good ventilation so that you don't get soaked in condensation over night. Avoid a big \"princess\" tent; these don't stand up well with a snow load.<\/p> <p>I also ask that all participants bring a small bundle of wood.\u00a0 You can purchase local wood.\u00a0 There are strict regulations on transporting firewood within the State of New York.\u00a0 If you plan to carry wood from home, it must be kiln dried.\u00a0 If you want to see why this is so important, go check out the birch trees in the Adirondacks.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/2\/1\/600_446012545.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/2\/600_446012578.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/d\/600_446012589.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Jason: Black Subaru Baja.

Fischler from the New York Times covered our first girls night out event.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/NewYorkTimesDecember112005.shtml\">Click here<\/a><\/p> <p>for the full article. Some excerpts from the article include:<\/p> <p><br\/>\"The hardest thing is to establish a circle of friends, a circle of single people,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"The idea of having a fun time for myself and meeting single women is very attractive. It takes away the scariness of doing the single thing, and puts a fun element in it.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>\"As the friends they have known from young adulthood commit to relationships, marry and have children, single women in their 30's, 40's and 50's, especially in the suburbs, often find themselves out of the loop. Tagging along with couples becomes awkward, and the common ground of shared experience dwindles. The single friend may feel stuck in a rerun of \"Sex and the City\" while the married friend has moved on to the Wisteria Lane of \"Desperate Housewives.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>\"A lot of women my age are married or have kids,\" Dr. Hughes said. \"They are just on a different path in their lives. They are not interested in going out or doing anything with the singles scene. I am still looking to go out, to meet men.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Not only would they have a chance to commiserate with other unattached women over fresh fruit, sushi and cucumber water, they would also choose from a menu of pampering treatments, from mini-facials to professional makeup applications, having their hair blown out and attending a group lesson on skin care.<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterward, relaxed, primped and perhaps bonded, the 18 women would move straight on to the more traditional half of the double-barreled event: a men-and-women singles party at Cirella's, a restaurant in the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Meeting women and men - it's a good two options,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"Doing the spa thing, if all goes wrong, you walk away with your facial. If all goes right, you make some new friends. If it goes extremely well, you walk out with a potential guy's phone number or being asked your phone number.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>At singles events for men and women, Dr. Hughes said, she often got \"that standoffish thing\" from other women. So the women-only mixer at the spa was a refreshing change, a chance to be cohorts instead of rivals. \"In this kind of situation, it's a lot more relaxed,\" she said.<\/p> <p>\n\nContact us now at (516)[masked] or (718)[masked] with any questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HangOutInQueensAndNassau\/events\/228928506\/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"name":"Girls Night Out (to make new friends)- Blo","id":"228928506","time":1457827200000,"updated":1457888537000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1300408136000,"name":"Hang Out in Queens and Nassau","group_lon":-73.7099990845,"id":1800499,"urlname":"HangOutInQueensAndNassau","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Locals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Greenvale","address_1":"50 Glen Cove Rd","name":"Blo Blow Dry Bar","lon":-73.627853,"id":24372123,"state":"NY","lat":40.811848,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.462272644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456580651000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Prepay required at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/>--------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0<br\/>As Featured on CNN and in the NEW YORK TIMES\u00a0<br\/>---------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>DESCRIPTION\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ladies, All of your friends are married, engaged, not around?

Some excerpts from the article include:<\/p> <p><br\/>\"The hardest thing is to establish a circle of friends, a circle of single people,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"The idea of having a fun time for myself and meeting single women is very attractive. It takes away the scariness of doing the single thing, and puts a fun element in it.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>\"As the friends they have known from young adulthood commit to relationships, marry and have children, single women in their 30's, 40's and 50's, especially in the suburbs, often find themselves out of the loop. Tagging along with couples becomes awkward, and the common ground of shared experience dwindles. The single friend may feel stuck in a rerun of \"Sex and the City\" while the married friend has moved on to the Wisteria Lane of \"Desperate Housewives.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>\"A lot of women my age are married or have kids,\" Dr. Hughes said. \"They are just on a different path in their lives. They are not interested in going out or doing anything with the singles scene. I am still looking to go out, to meet men.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Not only would they have a chance to commiserate with other unattached women over fresh fruit, sushi and cucumber water, they would also choose from a menu of pampering treatments, from mini-facials to professional makeup applications, having their hair blown out and attending a group lesson on skin care.<\/p> <p><br\/>Afterward, relaxed, primped and perhaps bonded, the 18 women would move straight on to the more traditional half of the double-barreled event: a men-and-women singles party at Cirella's, a restaurant in the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Meeting women and men - it's a good two options,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"Doing the spa thing, if all goes wrong, you walk away with your facial. If all goes right, you make some new friends. If it goes extremely well, you walk out with a potential guy's phone number or being asked your phone number.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>At singles events for men and women, Dr. Hughes said, she often got \"that standoffish thing\" from other women. So the women-only mixer at the spa was a refreshing change, a chance to be cohorts instead of rivals. \"In this kind of situation, it's a lot more relaxed,\" she said.<\/p> <p>\n\nContact us now at (516)[masked] or (718)[masked] with any questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Long-Island-Speed-Dating-Singles-Events\/events\/229176313\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Girls Night Out (to make new friends)- @ Blo","id":"229176313","time":1457827200000,"updated":1457838936000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297210050000,"name":"Long Island Social  Events\/","group_lon":-73.4000015259,"id":1780594,"urlname":"Long-Island-Speed-Dating-Singles-Events","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Greenvale","address_1":"50 Glen Cove Rd","name":"Blo Blow Dry Bar","lon":-73.627853,"id":24372123,"state":"NY","lat":40.811848,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.462272644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456580644000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Prepay required at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/>--------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0<br\/>As Featured on CNN and in the NEW YORK TIMES\u00a0<br\/>---------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xscfwC90JDk<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>DESCRIPTION\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ladies, All of your friends are married, engaged, not around?

Be sure to post a comment with which wine you will be bringing so that we can have a variety of bottles.

Overall, what this means is that we will have discussion based sessions where you guys (Student Leaders) will bring the topics you would like to talk about, and we'll all give our opinions, suggestions, and comments on the topic.\u00a0 Sample topics would be the following:<\/p> <p>1. How to publicize for an event<\/p> <p>2. How to recruit new members<\/p> <p>3. How to deal with a lazy Eboard member<\/p> <p>4.

As a performer, Joe Crookston is a true artist, painting compelling portraits of both the unsung and anti-heroes who populate the American landscape. From the depths of despair in the prison cell of high school dropout, Freddie \"the Falcon\", to high above the New York skyline where a window washer sings of his young child who thinks he can fly, Joe's masterfully crafted lyrics will take you on an emotional journey that will delight your ears and engage your heart.<\/p> <p>Joe is a consummate storyteller and skillful musician whose dexterity on guitar, claw hammer banjo and violin to name a few, is sure to astound you. His songs have been performed and recorded by Irish harpers, a capella gospel choirs, solo artists, bluegrass bands and even by a certain Buddhist sect in France! His heart-wretching song, Blue Tattoo, based on the life of concentration camp survivor Dina Jacobson, was the inspiration for a documentary of the same name, and was featured this summer in a special news segment on ABC. Joe was awarded a year-long songwriting grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to travel throughout New York State, collect stories, and write original songs.<\/p> <p>When not touring, Joe enjoys teaching and facilitating at songwriting workshops across the country. His impressive discography includes Georgia I'm Here (2014), Darkling &amp; The Bluebird Jubilee (2011), Able Baker Charlie and Dog (2008), Fall Down As The Rain (2004).. Here's what folks are saying about Joe Crookston ...<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KrdlYftMn94?list=PLh0mUhu5JztQTofiIIhsScY5AfTemR6lc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/KrdlYftMn94?list=PLh0mUhu5JztQTofiIIhsScY5AfTemR6lc<\/a><\/p> <p>His CD, \"Able Baker Charlie &amp; Dog\" received the most airplay of any folk acoustic recording and was awarded:<br\/>\"Album of the year\" by the International Folk Alliance in Memphis, TN.<\/p> <p>\"At every festival I hope to find the gift of one artist whose songwriting and preforming stand out.

As a performer, Joe Crookston is a true artist, painting compelling portraits of both the unsung and anti-heroes who populate the American landscape. From the depths of despair in the prison cell of high school dropout, Freddie \"the Falcon\", to high above the New York skyline where a window washer sings of his young child who thinks he can fly, Joe's masterfully crafted lyrics will take you on an emotional journey that will delight your ears and engage your heart.<\/p> <p>Joe is a consummate storyteller and skillful musician whose dexterity on guitar, claw hammer banjo and violin to name a few, is sure to astound you. His songs have been performed and recorded by Irish harpers, a capella gospel choirs, solo artists, bluegrass bands and even by a certain Buddhist sect in France! His heart-wretching song, Blue Tattoo, based on the life of concentration camp survivor Dina Jacobson, was the inspiration for a documentary of the same name, and was featured this summer in a special news segment on ABC. Joe was awarded a year-long songwriting grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to travel throughout New York State, collect stories, and write original songs.<\/p> <p>When not touring, Joe enjoys teaching and facilitating at songwriting workshops across the country. His impressive discography includes Georgia I'm Here (2014), Darkling &amp; The Bluebird Jubilee (2011), Able Baker Charlie and Dog (2008), Fall Down As The Rain (2004)..\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KrdlYftMn94?list=PLh0mUhu5JztQTofiIIhsScY5AfTemR6lc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/KrdlYftMn94?list=PLh0mUhu5JztQTofiIIhsScY5AfTemR6lc<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nHere's what folks are saying about Joe Crookston ...<\/p> <p>His CD, \"Able Baker Charlie &amp; Dog\" received the most airplay of any folk acoustic recording and was awarded:<br\/>\"Album of the year\" by the International Folk Alliance in Memphis, TN.<\/p> <p>\"At every festival I hope to find the gift of one artist whose songwriting and preforming stand out.

Games were competitive but went by pretty quick.<\/p> <p><br\/>For many of the newer ppl that is aware of our history, this group used to be nothing more than a few friends playing a game we all love. It was a struggle to get even a 6 on 6 game but our meetup has grown immensely. Thirty plus people show up regularly, requiring that we set up two separate games. With the influx of people it has fundamentally change the way I organize everything.<\/p> <p>Rules we knew by heart have to be reinforced or put in writing for all to understand, ensuring different players get a fair chance playing with different QB's, cracking the whip to modify some ppl's unsportsman-like behavior, and the juggling of personalities\/divas is another issue.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the feedback last week and as a result each game will have a time limit of 1 hour's play. The purpose of this structure is to ensure teams get to play other teams, in a round robin format, since we consistently have enough for two separate games now. This will keep things fresh instead of a trench warfare kind of a game that stretches 3 hours just so one team scores 5, 6, or 7 points for the win. If each game is a max of 1 hour then theoretically we can play the three other teams before noon.<\/p> <p>While some receivers complain they don't get any looks with certain QB's, this is not a matter that should be voiced to me until you have tried to communicate (that doesn't mean screaming) with the QB yourself. I'm not your babysitter and I personally have never complained a QB hasn't given any receiver a fair chance. As I noted, I try to rotate each person to different QB's so please stop telling me to put you in the game with your friends. This creates an environment whereby the QB will always focus on their friend and neglect the other receivers on the team. I'm not perfect so if I put you on with the same QB then you can let me know and I'll be more cognizant of it next time. Additionally, one of our cardinal rule is that if you're late you will have to wait until the next game. Please do not pull your friend onto your team. This will no longer be tolerated.<\/p> <p>Lastly, Super Ramon stated his record has been a perfect 5-0 the past two weeks. I do take that into consideration when I set up the teams and why teams may not always appear \"equal.\" My goal is to always make the teams competitive, hoping the eventual score is a close 5-4, or so, game. It's why tier 2 or 3 QB's have a stronger set of receivers than a tier 1 QB; a good QB can carry a whole team. It is also why I switch some receivers from some teams if they can blow away another team 5-0 or 5-1.<\/p> <p>While I may be a loud mouth (but not as big of one like King or Abe) in enforcing the rules (and my way), it's done with much thought in making the games more safe and fun. This meetup is not about any single person, including myself; but it's about what's in the best interest of EVERYONE!<\/p> <p>Game will be in Bay 8th. Dyker is being used by soccer leagues now.<\/p> <p><br\/>Yours truly,<\/p> <p>Miketator<\/p> <p>***************<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Attendance will be strictly enforced. No-shows will be marked and posted on the subsequent meetup.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/229380412\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvfbrb","time":1457874000000,"updated":1457886588000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456090587000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i> (MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.
