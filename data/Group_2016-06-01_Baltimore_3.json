Would you like to be more adventurous in your wine selection but do not want to waste money on wines you do not like?<\/p> \n<p>If you would like to learn more about wines without breaking the bank, then this meet up group is for you. The Wine Experience is partnered with the Boisset Wine Collection (a portfolio of over 20 wineries in 4 countries) to bring The Wine Experience to everyone through private wine tastings. Our wine tastings are a fantastic way to treat your family and friends to a guided wine experience, allowing them to taste the wines before making their selections, which will be delivered to their front door. If you would like to meet up with like minded wine lovers, or if you would like to try our guided wine experience before booking your own event for your family and friends, then attend one of our meet ups, or attend regularly as the wine tasting experiences change.<\/p> \n<p>Think of this as a wine co-operative. The cost of a wine tasting experience will be divided among Meet Up members who RSVP at least 2 weeks before the event, not to exceed $15. The wine tasting will consist of wines from various wineries, such as Raymond Vineyards, Buena Vista Winery, Lockwood Vineyards, De Loach Vineyards, just to name a few.<\/p> \n<p>Locations for these events may be a group members home, or a larger venue. Light food pairings will be at each event.<\/p> \n<p>THE COST IS NOT ADMISSION. IT IS A DIVISION OF A WINE PURCHASE AMONG THIS MEET UP GROUP'S MEMBERS. YOU CANNOT NOT PAY AT THE EVENT.

ANYONE NOT ON THE GUEST LIST MAY NOT ENTER THE EVENT.<\/p> \n<p>There is NO OBLIGATION to purchase wine at these private events, although order forms will be available.<\/p> \n<p>The goal is to bring Odenton wine lover's together in a very cost affordable way. Each event's cost will be calculated and divided among the members, with the projection that at least 12 people will attend. Meet Up's WePay will be used to collect each member's contribution. No one will be charged more than the projected amount.
