The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood! \u00a0Sara you are an angel among angels.\u00a0I am grateful. Thank you<\/p> <p>3. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"34 chester road belmont","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/230147562\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Relaxing and Meditative Sacred Sound Bath","id":"230147562","time":1460818800000,"updated":1460826981000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Salem","address_1":"142 Derby St","name":"Derby Joe","lon":-70.885689,"id":24184198,"state":"MA","lat":42.522026,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.6462430954,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452719236000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Players to arrive around 1045 am; We will create the tournament brackets and get cracking!

And the Redruth, a nursery ship, carries Frederick \"Fitcher\" Penrose, a horticulturist determined to track down the priceless treasures of China that are hidden in plain sight: its plants that have the power to heal, or beautify, or intoxicate. All will converge in Canton's Fanqui-town, or Foreign Enclave: a tumultuous world unto itself where civilizations clash and sometimes fuse. It is a powder keg awaiting a spark to ignite the Opium Wars.<br\/>Spectacular coincidences, startling reversals of fortune, and tender love stories abound. But this is much more than an irresistible page-turner. The blind quest for money, the primacy of the drug trade, the concealment of base impulses behind the rhetoric of freedom: in River of Smoke the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries converge, and the result is a consuming historical novel with powerful contemporary resonance.

I've pasted the event description below!<br\/>-----<br\/>Join us on Obscura Day to explore Brook Farm, a Utopian community of the Transcendentalists.<\/p> <p>Located alongside an orphan's cemetery, the former site of Brook Farm commemorates the most famous utopian commune to ever have operated in the United States. Established in West Roxbury in April 1841 by the transcendentalists George and Sophia Ripley, Brook Farm (also known as the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education) sought to equally distribute the tasks of daily life while providing education for all participants; the end goal was a balance of work and leisure that would, above all, benefit the greater good. Unfortunately, turning a profit from the farm's agricultural surplus proved unrealistic and Brook Farm was forced to shutter in 1847.<\/p> <p>Nonetheless, the experiment at Brook Farm played a key role in the development of American religious and cultural philosophy. During its heyday, the commune was home to some of America's most renowned thinkers of the period, including Charles Anderson Dana, Greeley, Margaret Fuller, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne would ultimately set his novel The Blithedale Romance in a utopian community modeled after Brook Farm.<\/p> <p>This Obscura Day, join three scholars of utopian communities and the literature of New England from the Brandeis University English Department to walk through what is left of the site. This event will give you a chance to explore what remains of the farm, while attempting to convey a sense of its residents' daily life--and their ambitious dreams.<br\/>-----<br\/>Please remember to register on the Atlas Obscura site as well! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atlasobscura.com\/events\/obscura-day-2016-the-abandoned-utopia-of-brook-farm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.atlasobscura.com\/events\/obscura-day-2016-the-abandoned-utopia-of-brook-farm<\/a><\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I, Louisa, will be wearing a dark-purple coat and dark-blue jeans.

The cost is usually around $12-20\/person (not including any drinks for which people pay their own way). \u00a0We are open to restaurant suggestions. \u00a0However, I am not willing to get into dividing up large numbers of orders on one giant check, which is why we generally go to Chinatown and split everything down the middle. \u00a0If you don't want to eat at all, you can come and just enjoy the company for free. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Please BRING CASH if you can and want to go to dinner - many of the restaurants limit cards to two per table, so if a lot of people have no cash it can be a problem.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/d\/a\/600_446055322.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Stuart Street view<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/1\/2\/600_446055378.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We usually have several tables pulled together at the highest point of the food court nearest the elevator.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-japanese\/events\/229731003\/","yes_rsvp_count":43,"duration":7200000,"name":"Saturday Social Meetup at City Place","id":"zbclplyvgbvb","time":1460836800000,"updated":1460863639000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1042101769000,"name":"Boston Japanese & English Language Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":86694,"urlname":"boston-japanese","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Japanese\/English Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"255 Elm Street","name":"Foundry On Elm","lon":-71.121887,"id":5703082,"state":"MA","lat":42.395523,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.61826324463,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458143064000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.picgifs.com\/food-and-drinks\/food-and-drinks\/beer\/food-and-drinks-beer-638370.gif\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>Hup hup hup! try avoiding ordering drinks just before schedule changes to stay with the group.<\/p> <p>Red line \"service\" will have shuttle buses between Harvard Sq. &amp; Alewife.<\/i>\u00a0<br\/>SCHEDULE:<\/p> <p><\/b><b>5:00-- Foundry on Elm<\/b><b><\/p> <p>5:45:\u00a0\u00a0Saloon-- next door.

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.<\/p> <p>The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.

It is a way of communicating with your inner or spirit self and retrieving information. Your inner self is in constant communication with all aspects of your environment, seen and unseen. You need only journey within to find answers to your questions. Be prepared, however, for whatever insights you may receive, whether you like them or not.<br\/>The spirit healing journey is not always what people expect, and sometimes there is uncertainty as to what one should experience in altered states. The ecstatic trance is an individual journey into non-ordinary reality; therefore, experiences vary from person to person and from journey to journey. Once you enter a trance state, the rhythm or sound of the drum tends to change. The drumbeat may appear to speed up or slow down, while the sound may grow louder, softer, or disappear. You may experience a change in body temperature, feel energy flowing through your body, or find yourself twitching, swaying, or rocking. It is not uncommon to hear sounds or voices. You may even smell specific aromas. You may see colorful patterns, symbolic images, or dreamlike visions. Some people may find that they have a highly developed inner vision while others may rely more on instinct, intuition, or intent.<br\/>During the spirit healing journey, one's awareness transcends ordinary reality. In journeys to the Lower World, one may experience the sensation of falling, sliding, or spiraling downward into or under the Earth. In Upper World journeys, one may experience the sensation of rising, floating, flying, or spiraling upward through the air or sky. Journeys to the Lower World involve the movement of awareness to a level beneath ordinary reality and Celestial journeys involve movement to a level above ordinary reality. Lower levels are denser, lower in frequency, and more involved with the physical body, the earthly plane, and material reality. Higher levels are higher in frequency, less dense, and subtler.<br\/>You will experience at least two spiritual journeys. You do not need prior journeying experiences but an openness of the process and possibilities. Elaine is a training and practicing Shaman and will safely lead you on your journey. Please bring a yoga mat, blanket, something to cover your eyes (scarf), and journal as you may wish to write your experiences immediately following the journey. $10 Any questions or to register please contact Elaine [masked] or[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/228616175\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"An Evening of Shamanic Spiritual Healing This is the last journeying group\ud83c\udf1f","id":"qdwwpgyvgbvb","time":1460845800000,"updated":1460853848000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Melrose","address_1":"428 main street","name":"Fundraiser Venue","lon":-71.066376,"id":24491982,"state":"MA","lat":42.453869,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.50170755386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459194118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come for a night of fun tournaments, games, karaoke, raffles, live music and much more!

The tower top has been remodeled and reopened in February. The location provides a very unique perspective on our city and allows for some spectacular panoramas.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Main focus of this event<\/b>: aerial views, cityscapes, city life.<\/p> <p>The observation platform on top of the Custom House is publicly available at certain times and has a unique and grand overview of the city. We will arrive before sunset, which is at 7:27 pm, the hotel lets people up 6 and 7 pm, but once up there, we can stay until they close at 11pm. Shooting at night is both challenging (balancing highlights with shadows) and very rewarding for the outcome.<\/p> <p>This is an attendance-limited event because the space on the clock tower platform is limited. There is not enough space for more than 12 people and we will need to accommodate hotel guests and other visitors. Please be friendly, considerate and leave a good impression. Even if they bump into your tripod.<\/p> <p>Parking garages are nearby, I usually use the 70 State Street garage, which is around $11 after 5 pm and right around the corner. Some street parking may be available, but avoid the Aquarium garage, which is the most expensive in town. Search Google for \"parking near...\" or download an app named \"Best Parking\"<\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet at 6:45 in the lobby of the Marriott hotel. Even though we can stay as long or late as we want, the window to be brought up is 6-7, they may not take you up if you are late. If you don't find us in the lobby, buy your ticket and have the concierge \/ bell boy take you up. <b>There is a cover charge of $7.50<\/b>, including a soft drink or $15 including an alcoholic beverage (not worth it), your choice, but you have to pay to be left up.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Challenges<\/b>:<\/p> <p><br\/>As you can see from picture #2, the wall is quite high and it has a fence on top of it to prevent you from committing suicide if your photos don't turn out well. In addition, there is an ornate structure build all around the tower, which protrudes out, making it difficult to get a wide angle shot without that showing in the pic. You will <b>need<\/b>\u00a0a tall tripod (at least 5+ ft high - native or by extension). If you have a center column that comes out and can be configured as a perpendicular boom (on top of the 6 ft), that absolutely helps to get the lens between the metal bars. I can tell you for sure that small tripods (&lt;5 ft) will not work, especially if they have the legs connected to force it into a triangle. The only way I was able to get shots was by leaning the tripod against the wall with two legs and pushing the third leg close, asymmetrically. Small cameras can even be pushed through the fence to be outside to avoid that ornate structure. Just don't drop it, I will not be responsible for any killed pedestrians. :) Hand-strap highly recommended.<\/p> <p>One other thing that works well is a large Joby Gorilla pod, which can be used for smaller DSLR cameras, I used this recently on the Empire State Building. Just hold on tight to make sure it doesn't fall. You can get that <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1Rw9Juh\">with ball head <\/a>or <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/22gDlQ6\">without ball head<\/a> (if you have a spare). This is a fairly sturdy little tripod that can be flexed to go around bars. Just make sure to hold on to it.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/5\/1\/600_445230033.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Dress in layers, count on wind being higher up there than on the ground. Bring gloves head cover, expected temperature is in the mid-40s.<\/p> <p><br\/>This will be a half-moon night, reducing the contrast between street lights and shadows somewhat.

Godard reverses the standard love triangle and challenges the in uence of consumer culture in the stylish and sensual A MARRIED WOMAN, one of his most playfully provocative dissections of modern life. Shot in striking black-and-white, the lm lingers lovingly on closeups of intertwined nude bodies. During the course of 24 hours Charlotte (Macha Me\u0301ril), the bourgeois wife of an airline pilot, drifts aimlessly between an affair in the morning with artistic Robert (Bernard Noe\u0308l), an actor, and spending a mundane evening with her paternalistic husband Pierre (Philippe Leroy). Unsure whether she loves either man, Charlotte discovers she is pregnant and must come to terms with her emotional in delities.

No, I'm not crazy (that's up for debate). I am, however, crazy about YOU and this GROUP! (Over 300 members in 6 months, yikes! You guys amaze me.)<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's how this *Bonus* feast event idea came about . . .<\/p> <p><br\/>One of our original members, Karen, reached out and inspired me to come up with a \"healthier\" focused feast. Not a bad idea, right? (Especially after our indulgent, decadent, buttery, yet heavenly Julia Child feast\u2014it was glorious and unforgettable).<\/p> <p><br\/>I didn't have any immediate ideas on what would be fun, healthful, educational and, most importantly, delicious. Plus I had our entire year of events fully mapped out, and was hesitant to make any changes.<\/p> <p><br\/>Then it hit me . . . For the last few weeks, I have been obsessing over a new book, Simple Green Smoothies. I make them for myself and for my 2 year old son. We both LOVE them! The book\u2014and blog\u2014has truly inspired and challenged me while nourishing my family. So the thought occurred, \"Why not create a *Bonus* feast and share in this experience with each of you?!\" (Thank you, Karen!)<\/p> <p><br\/>This event is going to be similar to our traditional feasts, but with a twist. Instead of a buffet of food to partake in, this feast will be a showcase of green smoothies to sip and sample.<\/p> <p><br\/>Yep! We're each going to pick a smoothie recipe to prepare (ahead of time), bring it in to share, and drink \"shot glass\" sized samples of all the smoothies. It's the perfect way to try a variety of smoothies in one sitting without have to buy all the ingredients! Pretty sweet, right? <b>NOTE ::<\/b> I don't think you have to double the recipe. Each recipe serves 2-3 adults.<\/p> <p><br\/>I'm definitely going to bring my copy of the book with me so I can tab recipes I like best. Put my custom post-it notes to good use! ;-)<\/p> <p>If you don't have a copy of the book, feel free to use a recipe from the blog. Please be sure post the link in the comments section and bring a printed copy with you, too. Otherwise, we'll focus on the array of green smoothie recipes from their book. See links below.

This is our favorite location - a quiet, rural side street with plenty of parking, a HUGE fenced yard, plenty of chairs, and lots and lots of flat grassy green space to run and run and run!<\/p> <p>Remember that your host provides the soft drinks and paperware for each meetup, but we count on our members to bring the snacks. Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs, but try to bring soft snacks so that Clovis can have some too! If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!<\/p> <p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?<\/p> <p>Please let your organizer know!<\/p> <p>We are very fortunate to have Sharon host most of our fair weather meetups during the course of the year, with occasional help from myself, but we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup.\u00a0 We are looking for folks to host meetups on either Saturday or Sunday!<\/p> <p>We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in 2016. For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 20 to 40 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE MEETUPS<\/p> <p>We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. You can't miss him, he is the Pug in the wheelchair. \u00a0I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!<\/p> <p>Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!<\/p> <p>Your organizer pays $89.84 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SouthofBostonPugs\/events\/226498366\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"duration":7200000,"name":"The South of Boston April Pug Sunday Meetup","id":"226498366","time":1460916000000,"updated":1460936701000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1141585480000,"name":"The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group","group_lon":-71,"id":226623,"urlname":"SouthofBostonPugs","group_lat":42.0800018311,"who":"Pug People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":10,"distance":24.7654075623,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456002136000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>On\u00a0December 21, 2015 - The Gavel Public House Opened in Wrentham Center - Let's go check it out for dinner!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Gavel Public House, 36 South St., is located across from the Wrentham Town Common. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Gavel\u2019s menu features Grass Fed Certified Angus beef, free-range organic chicken, and locally sourced wild-caught seafood.

Ultimately it helps us to be ourselves, freeing ourselves up from the limitations of our past beliefs and the hold negative past experiences have had on us. Learn how to clear past events or memories that get triggered frequently. Remove the blocks to creating more abundance and success in your life and find out how you can use EFT to heal from chronic physical and\/or emotional pain. Eliminate phobias, fears, anxiety, food cravings and feelings of sadness or depression.<\/p> <p><br\/>A tapping circle is a group in which all members tap together and in turn on the issues that ail them. This process\u00a0allows you to heal your issue whether you openly participate or prefer to remain private. Our\u00a0tapping circle welcomes tappers of all levels, including complete beginners. What better way to try EFT than in a group setting where a strong and powerful synergy takes place between all present!<\/p> <p>Please arrive early. Doors will open 15 minutes ahead of time and the tapping circle will begin promptly at 2 pm. Late comers will not be allowed in. A late arrival not only disrupts the flow of the circle, shatters the feeling of safety so necessary in healing work, but can also prevent the facilitator from pacing the circle well.<\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor more information on EFT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emofree.com\">www.emofree.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eftuniverse.com\">www.eftuniverse.com<\/a><\/p> <p>For more information on the organizer and facilitator of the Boston Tapping Circles: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.luciemonroe.com\">www.luciemonroe.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Feel free to email Lucie, the organizer, if you have questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-healers-network\/events\/229060039\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"EFT Tapping Circle","id":"xwhtqlyvgbwb","time":1460916000000,"updated":1460925246000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1180109374000,"name":"The Boston Healers Network","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":511093,"urlname":"boston-healers-network","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02140","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"333 Rindge Ave","name":"Russell Field","lon":-71.136597,"id":714161,"state":"MA","lat":42.393736,"repinned":false},"headcount":50,"distance":4.1302690506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441304848000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Here's the game plan:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/7\/c\/event_110654972.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>1:00 - Toss the disc around, meet folks, be merry<\/p> <p>1:10 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams<\/p> <p>1:20 - Play!!!!!!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/img1.meetupstatic.com\/img\/smileys\/love.gif\" \/><\/p> <p>3:00 - Conclude the meetup with snacks and socializing<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist):<\/p> <p>Dress for the weather<\/p> <p>Bring a white t-shirt and a colored t-shirt.

If you're driving, you can park on the street for free on Sundays!<\/p> <p>Anyone who loves ASL is welcome to come and be part of the fun! We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

The classes run in 6 week series to focus each week on a new skill set and area of Parkour Training. This first session on April 17 is a introductory class to provide foundational techniques and a basci knowledge of safety in order to quickly progress thorugh our Spring 1 Series (6 Weeks held every Sunday hereafter)<br\/>The cost of April 17 is $10, and going forward the 6 week series is $50 if you would rather pay beforehand. FAQs<br\/>------<br\/>What is Parkour?<\/p> <p>Parkour is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training. Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible.<\/p> <p>Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation. Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.<\/p> <p>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before? This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps. What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level. What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos. Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice. We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<br\/>We will be charging a $10 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of. Anything else?<\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!

Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large. Oh and add to that I spend 30+ hours every week of my own time running the group which I get paid $0 for.<\/p> <p>Please help keep the group going.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/230190999\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvgbxb","time":1461020400000,"updated":1461032958000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02110","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"52 Summer St.","name":"Uno Due Go (UDG) ","lon":-71.059151,"id":5031742,"state":"MA","lat":42.354507,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.67266523838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458609839000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>[Esperanta versio sube] Informal meeting to get to know each other, learn Esperanto, and practice speaking and reading.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/230331835\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvgbxb","time":1461022200000,"updated":1461034780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02459","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newton Center","address_1":"234 Herrick Road","name":"Wilson Chapel, Lower Level, Andover Newton Theological School","lon":-71.188293,"id":11862332,"state":"MA","lat":42.324081,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":6.54468774796,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1361472399000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Henry-David-Thoreau-Sangha\/events\/230331633\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Zen Meditation","id":"dhjmlfyvgbxb","time":1461022200000,"updated":1461034757000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1361471852000,"name":"Henry David Thoreau Sangha","group_lon":-71.1900024414,"id":7286772,"urlname":"Henry-David-Thoreau-Sangha","group_lat":42.3100013733,"who":"Bodhisattvas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"44 Fifth Street","name":"Moves & Vibes Dance Studio","lon":-71.188751,"id":19335432,"state":"MA","lat":42.184925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5623426437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449460888000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>December 7th, Moves &amp; Vibes Dance Co starting a 8-week advance beginner Zouk beginners course.

She is featured in the Emmy Award-winning BBC documentary \"The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive,\" which destigmatizes mental illness, as do her many popular novels and memoirs, including Postcards From the Edge and Wishful Drinking.<\/p> <p>Renowned throughout a literary career spanning decades for her bravely honest and deeply funny style, Ms. Fisher's work humanizes a popular culture obsessed with celebrity, and helps readers laugh at the absurdity of contemporary society and relationships. Her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.<\/p> <p>The Humanist Hub has hosted similar award ceremonies with comedian Eddie Izzard (2013) author Mary Roach (2012) Seth MacFarlane (Fall 2011) Stephen Fry (Spring 2011) Discovery Chanel\u2019s MythBusters Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman (2010) director Joss Whedon (2009) Bad Religion\u2019s Greg Graffin (2008) and Sir Salman Rushdie (2007).<\/p> <p>The Hub, also known as The Humanist Community at Harvard, is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, dedicated to building a model nonreligious community where humanist values inspire people to connect deeply and change the world. Founded as the first chaplaincy for atheists and agnostics in US history, we have grown into a diverse community serving thousands throughout Greater Boston and helping inspire the growth of similar communities worldwide.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here she outlines ways that are available to everyone to defeat impediments to the creative life, asserting that the doing of art makes us artists. Fear is the obstacle, she says, so set aside external evaluation and self-judgment. These are hardly new concepts, but taken in the broadest sense of Langer's stated goal--the engagement in new, creative endeavors--this energetically written title can help many invigorate their lives with artistic exploration, which is its own achievement. The embrace of uncertainty is as requisite as experiencing the creative moment for making authentic art, she argues, stating that we should value mistakes, and reject absolutes and social comparisons. Langer's latest encourages readers to bravely seek self-reinvention by creative action, and in so doing, find it.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front of the cafe near the windows.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group\/events\/229707562\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"On Becoming an Artist: ...

You are invited to join us for a bite to eat afterwards in Harvard Square (usually at Cafe Algiers).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Secular-Buddhists\/events\/230450875\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Mindfulness of Thoughts","id":"230450875","time":1461106800000,"updated":1461119067000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1285116716000,"name":"Cambridge Secular Buddhists","group_lon":-71.0800018311,"id":1710691,"urlname":"Cambridge-Secular-Buddhists","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"35 Binney Street ","name":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Jimmy Fund Auditorium","lon":-71.107231,"id":24057528,"state":"MA","lat":42.337109,"repinned":false},"headcount":320,"distance":2.47812199593,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460137667000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Michael Greger, MD, will speak on his\u00a0<i>New York Times<\/i>\u00a0Best Seller book,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1250066115\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1250066115&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=essway-20&amp;linkId=L7LS6Y2NRQXLHYHP\"><i>How Not To Die<\/i><\/a>.\u00a0 <\/b><br\/>Open to the public.

We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind.

The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen.

Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Do political parties matter? Are compromise and civility necessary for governing well? Do interests and identities take precedence over other bases for solidarity, including the ties of nationhood? All four countries represented on this panel\u2014US, UK, Israel, India\u2014are confronting these challenges in unique ways. In each, new digital technologies are centrally implicated in turning conventional democratic processes on their heads.

He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, \u00fcber-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band\u2019s music videos. There\u2019s only one problem: he\u2019s not part of a band\u2026yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he\u2019s promised - calling himself \u201cCosmo\u201d and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.

Her\u00a0Stone Readings gradually evolved\u00a0as she began to notice\u00a0uncanny parallels and similarities\u00a0between \u201cMother Nature\u201d and \u201cHuman Nature,\u201d and between the \u2018world of people\u2019 and the \u2018world of stones.\u2019<\/p> <p>Because of her connection with her stones and crystals, The Stone Lady\u00a0 is able to attune to you via the specific stones which are aligned or connected with you.

In this talk I'll show how OLS, GLM, Ridge, and ElasticNet models fit into a single computational framework that can be implemented in short, understandable snippets of R code.

It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities.<br\/>Think Git + BitTorrent + The Web. IPFS is in use by thousands of developers, for all kinds of things from distributing files more efficiently, to making decentralized chat applications, to giving permanent addresses to content, to hosting content for Blockchains. IPFS is one of the hottest and fastest growing Open Source projects!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Come learn about Ethereum dApps that are using IPFS to host decentralized content. ConsenSys will present uPort, a project using programs on the Ethereum Blockchain and content on IPFS to maintain identity records that are permanent, uncensorable, and controlled only by you! The uPort attestation system allows third party authorities as well as peers to validate the user's information creating both a rich social fabric as well as powering solid KYC\/AML systems in the financial sector.<\/p> <p><br\/>You can learn more about IPFS at <a href=\"https:\/\/ipfs.io\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/ipfs.io<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ipfs\/ipfs\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/ipfs\/ipfs<\/a><\/p> <p>This is the first IPFS Boston Meetup!

Jason. \u00a0If you trust me, and if I've helped you in the past, then you already know that if I am endorsing this man, you can trust him as well.<\/p> <p>So if you want to become the kind of many who is living each day powerfully and is magnetically attractive to the kind of women YOU want, then I urge you to attend this one-of-a-kind coaching event being held at my place.<\/p> <p>*************************************************\u00a0<br\/>HOW TO GET INVOLVED\u00a0<br\/>*************************************************<\/p> <p><b>Where is it?<\/b> This event is going to be at a private home in Arlington, MA. It's very easy to get to both by car and public transportation, and there's plenty of on-street parking. Directions will be emailed to you. We will start the event promptly at 7:00pm and run until 9:00pm. Please plan on arriving by 6:45 so you have time to settle in and meet the other guests. You never know who you'll meet that can become a new friend and add a lot of value to your life.<\/p> <p><b>How much?<\/b> Cheap. \u00a0Milt's accumulated wisdom spans many decades. \u00a0For you to be able to get help with your personal challenges by a man as wise and experienced as Milt, you'd have to pay at least $100 for a private counseling session. \u00a0But because this is in a group format, you're getting in for much cheaper.<\/p> <p><b>So how much?<\/b> Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to. \u00a0The cost for this event is only $20, which is very low considering the quality of training that you'll be getting.<\/p> <p>Think about it... <b>that's 67 cents a day for a month<\/b>. \u00a0What else do you spend 67 cents on every day that makes no difference in your life whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time, and like I said... you'll learn just as much (if not more) from listening to him coach other man as you will from him coaching you.<\/p> <p><b>How big is the class?<\/b> Because this is class is being held at a private house and not a large seminar room, I have to limit the size to only 10 men. \u00a0I'm listing this in a few groups, so there will be at least 1,000 other men seeing this message, so be\u00a0sure to put in your RSVP right now in order to lock in your spot.<\/p> <p>Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot. \u00a0I'm looking forward to seeing you there.<\/p> <p>Warmly,<br\/>Jason<\/p> <p>P.S. - Take down my cell number in case you have any questions about the event or if you get lost.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The environment is now dominated by people\u2014approximately 1\/3 of land area has been transformed for human use and 1\/4 of global productivity diverted to human consumption. While concepts such as wilderness attempt to escape this reality, there is virtually no habitat on earth devoid of some sign of humans influence on the globe\u2014be it chemical, thermal, or a missing or introduced species. Today, this imprint is so pronounced that scientists are actively debating naming a new geological epoch demarcated by the sign of humans on the earth system itself: the Anthropocene.<\/p> <p>In the shadow of this debate, the HUCE seminar series \"Ecological Systems in the Anthropocene\" will examine the future of social-environmental systems in a globe heavily impacted by humans.

Down on their luck punk rockers The Ain\u2019t Rights are finishing up a long and unsuccessful tour, and are about to call it quits when they get an unexpected booking at an isolated, run-down club deep in the backwoods of Oregon. What seems merely to be a third-rate gig escalates into something much more sinister when they witness an act of violence backstage that they weren\u2019t meant to see. Now trapped backstage, they must face off against the club\u2019s depraved owner, Darcy Banker (Stewart), a man who will do anything to protect the secrets of his nefarious enterprise. But while Darcy and his henchmen think the band will be easy to get rid of, The Ain\u2019t Rights prove themselves much more cunning and capable than anyone expected, turning the tables on their unsuspecting captors and setting the stage for the ultimate life-or-death showdown.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q8XSARX3DQg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q8XSARX3DQg<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/230475095\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Green Room   4-21   Thur.

The presentation will be more \"good news\" that we have been \"Beggars At God's Banquet,\" unaware we are creators, and thus unaware of our incredible powers.<br\/>About Barry:<\/p> <p>Barry Harris majored in quantum physics in college, attended a \u201cNew Universe\u201d workshop taught by David Bohm (one of the most significant theoretical physicists of the 20th century), and Karl Pribram (who showed the brain as the decoder of holograms), and took a weeklong course with Karl Pribram\u2019s graduate student assistant.<\/p> <p>Barry also worked at the Hippocrates Institute in Boston, writing health booklets for Dr. Ann Wigmore, discoverer of wheatgrass and founder of the live food movement. Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill. While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries.<\/p> <p>Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics to Energy Medicine, cellular biology, neurophysiology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health, etc.<\/p> <p>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\" which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book \"Beggars At God's Banquet\" based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing in the spring.<\/p> <p>Barry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing\". His voice students learn the relationship of ego to breath patterns, and how to surrender control to a higher power. Barry is qualified to teach about miracles, because he had his own miracle. He restored his singing voice by recognizing the need for spiritual grace and surrender of control to a higher power, after Western doctors said he had damaged his voice beyond repair.<\/p> <p>Barry can be reached at [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HOLISTIC-HEALTH-SPEAKER-SERIES-AND-STUDY-GROUP\/events\/230477605\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"THE MIRACLE OF THE BRAIN'S NEUROPLASTICITY","id":"230477605","time":1461277800000,"updated":1461286136000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1260313056000,"name":"Holistic Health Speaker Series and Study Group","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":1567196,"urlname":"HOLISTIC-HEALTH-SPEAKER-SERIES-AND-STUDY-GROUP","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":3,"distance":20.597038269,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457661199000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our first book will be \"All the Light We Cannot See\" by Anthony Doerr.

Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed.

For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard.

Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts.

It's difficult to get a large group together at conventions, but hopefully we can use this meetup event to see who else is going, find people who want to sit together at panels, or play games together. It's a great event!<\/p> <p><b>WHAT IS PAX: <\/b>In 2004, the folks at Penny Arcade decided they wanted a show exclusively for gaming. Sure, comics, anime, and other nerd hobbies were cool, and those activities all had their own shows\u2026 so what about games? From that idea spawned a small 4,500 person event in Bellevue, Washington, focused on the culture and community that is gaming.<\/p> <p>Since then, the show hasn\u2019t looked back.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

He has over 10 years of experience organizing music events and getting behind a set of turntables. As a kid he grew up on a steady diet of metal\/hardcore, hip\u00adhop, and the his parents\u2019 collection from the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, and 70\u2019s. His love for music had him to making mixtapes on his parents cassette decks when he only in middle school. But, Chris\u2019 interest in deejaying didn\u2019t come about till high school after attending some local events where he heard deejays spinning jungle. His desire for knowledge mixed with a little bit of OCD led him to start collecting records and watch his favorite deejays to learn as much as he could whenever possible. His passion for music, like his record collection spans far and wide from jazz to experimental and everything in between. Chris has opened for numerous artists, and has played at countless venues throughout the New England area. As a performer whether cutting and blending hip\u00adhop to mixing dubstep or jungle on 3 decks Chris is obsessed with finding the perfect mix.<\/p> <p>Using Loops &amp; Cue Points to Mix in Serato<br\/>Friday, April 22nd @ 7pm<br\/>Free<br\/>Mmmmaven<br\/>614 Massachusetts Avenue #203<br\/>Cambridge, MA 02139<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mmmmaven\/events\/230125079\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Using Loops & Cue Points to Mix in Serato [4\/22] #FREE","id":"230125079","time":1461366000000,"updated":1461377862000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420320712000,"name":"Mmmmaven","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18296076,"urlname":"mmmmaven","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Mmmmaniacs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"62 Bow St","name":"The Green Room","lon":-71.099228,"id":23542643,"lat":42.381496,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":22,"distance":2.10962414742,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":5,"created":1453340575000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTE: Hello, all --- this April Meetup has been pushed to one week LATER than its usual time slot due to an out-of-town trip by Elise.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Thanks!<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p><br\/>2.5 hours of piano karaoke at The Green Room --- a wonderfully intimate venue in the heart of Union Square, Somerville.<\/p> <p>Much more info here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net\/#!faq\/cv94\">FAQ page<\/a><\/p> <p><b>COST:<\/b> $5+ requested donation at the door (to defray venue rental, piano tuning fees, Meetup organizer fees, etc.)<\/p> <p><b>NOTE:<\/b> The exterior door of The Green Room is a little tricky --- lift the handle UP instead of pulling it down!<\/p> <p><b>PARKING:<\/b> metered parking is available in the neighborhood.

The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and morning of the 4th. The second quarter moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year, but it could still be a good show if you are patient. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>April 22, 23 - Lyrids Meteor Shower. The Lyrids is an average shower, usually producing about 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet C\/1861 G1 Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce bright dust trails that last for several seconds. Unfortunately this year the glare from the full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Lyra, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>May 6, 7 - Eta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower, capable of producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rate can reach about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet Halley, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The new moon will ensure dark skies this year for what could be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>July 28, 29 - Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Delta Aquarids is an average shower that can produce up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August 23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. The second quarter moon will block most of the fainter meteors this year but if you are patient you should still be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>August 12, 13 - Perseids Meteor Shower. The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe, producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will set shortly after midnight, leaving fairly dark skies for should be an excellent early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 7 - Draconids Meteor Shower. The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The first quarter moon will block the fainter meteors in the early evening. It will set shortly after midnight leaving darker skies for observing any lingering stragglers. Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 21, 22 - Orionids Meteor Shower.

The shower runs annually from October 2 to November 7. It peaks this year on the night of October 21 and the morning of October 22. The second quarter moon will block some of the fainter meteors this year, but the Orionids tend to be fairly bright so it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 4, 5 - Taurids Meteor Shower. The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks this year on the the night of November 4. The first quarter moon will set just after midnight leaving dark skies for viewing. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 17, 18 - Leonids Meteor Shower. The Leonids is an average shower, producing up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The waning gibbous moon will block many of the fainter meteors this year, but if you are patient you should be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>December 13, 14 - Geminids Meteor Shower. The Geminids is the king of the meteor showers. It is considered by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 multicolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1982. The shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The nearly full moon will block out many of the fainter meteors this year, but the Geminids are so bright and numerous that it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>Source(s):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EverydaySpacer-com2\/events\/225030418\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Next Meteor Shower","id":"225030418","time":1461384900000,"updated":1461397588000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369503037000,"name":"Everyday Spacer Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":8638442,"urlname":"EverydaySpacer-com2","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Everyday Spacers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.0672056675,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453284410000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/f\/7\/600_445342775.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>WHERE: Trip to Costa Rica<\/p> <p>TYPE: Beach, Jungle or Volcano<\/p> <p>WHAT: Trip to paradise for Surf, Stand Up Paddleboard, Yoga, Horsebackriding, Zipline, ATV Tour (Coffee\/Jungle\/Waterfall), Waterfall Hike<br\/>OR: Volcano Tours, Rainforest Excursions, Brewery Tours, Fishing<\/p> <p>AIRPORT: LIBERIA, COSTA RICA (LIR) (arriving and departing between 11:30am and 3:30pm get you best shuttle rates) PRICES (APPX):<\/p> <p><br\/>$499pp Hostel Camamar Bronze Package Bronze: accommodations, meals &amp; airport transfer.<\/p> <p><br\/>$899 Hostel Camamar Silver Package: accommodations, meals, airport transfer &amp; surf lesson, sup lesson, snorkeling and horsebackriding (or substitute yoga).<\/p> <p><br\/>$1000+ for Gold Packages at Camamar, Tortuga, Mariposa, Azul, Diria, etc. that include a car rental\/tour guide, additional or different activities, and higher level accommodation in either a lodge, boutique hotel, hotel or resort.<\/p> <p>I live down there most of the winter teaching surf, sup and bringing people around on tour guides.

But to do so robs the millions who suffered in bondage of their full legacy.<\/p> <p><br\/>As historian Edward Baptist reveals in The Half Has Never Been Told, the expansion of slavery in the first eight decades after American independence drove the evolution and modernization of the United States. In the span of a single lifetime, the South grew from a narrow coastal strip of worn-out tobacco plantations to a continental cotton empire, and the United States grew into a modern, industrial, and capitalist economy. Until the Civil War, Baptist explains, the most important American economic innovations were ways to make slavery ever more profitable. Through forced migration and torture, slave owners extracted continual increases in efficiency from enslaved African Americans. Thus the United States seized control of the world market for cotton, the key raw material of the Industrial Revolution, and became a wealthy nation with global influence.<\/p> <p><br\/>Told through intimate slave narratives, plantation records, newspapers, and the words of politicians, entrepreneurs, and escaped slaves, The Half Has Never Been Told offers a radical new interpretation of American history. It forces readers to reckon with the violence at the root of American supremacy, but also with the survival and resistance that brought about slavery\u2019s end\u2014and created a culture that sustains America\u2019s deepest dreams of freedom.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Black-Book-Club\/events\/229083717\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":9900000,"name":"The Half Has Never Been Told...etc....by Edward E.
