All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help.

They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front.

To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center.

Our shared facilities include a huge dining hall where we host dinners, parties, and social events; a cozy living room where we show movies and host various clubs; a toddler room for young kids; a rumpus room with exercise equipment, ping-pong and a home theater; office space and meeting room; a laundry room; a large indoor bike storage area; and craft studios. Truly, living in cohousing offers the best of city living, bringing together a diverse and vibrant group of people who value individuality and a sense of community.<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn more at www.jpcohousing.org<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"JP cohousing members will welcome you for one of their regular tours.

- every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields\u00a0at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/227565676\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":6300000,"name":"Monday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"chrrdlytqblc","time":1451322900000,"updated":1451330486000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":3.70568823814,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445737454000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Must know the basics of play.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/227305211\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlytqblc","time":1451347200000,"updated":1451359212000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Anywhere","address_1":"Main Street","name":"Anywhere USA","lon":-71.382439,"id":1438737,"state":"MA","lat":42.407211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.309009552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449110482000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For this challenge, let's capture some pretty light decorations.

After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227581459\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytqblc","time":1451349000000,"updated":1451360505000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"76 Bigelow Avenue","address_2":"next door to Shiraz Cusine restaurant","name":"76 Bigelow Avenue","lon":-71.157166,"id":11082702,"state":"MA","lat":42.368317,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.49609136581,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1366809209000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Watertown-Belmont-Newton-Business-Referral-Networking\/events\/219482804\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Weekly Tuesday Morning Network Meetings","id":"dznnvfytqbmc","time":1451390400000,"updated":1451401787000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357829543000,"name":"Watertown\/Belmont\/Newton Business Referral Networking","group_lon":-71.1800003052,"id":6589142,"urlname":"Watertown-Belmont-Newton-Business-Referral-Networking","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Business Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.72169387341,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450329871000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Save the time and date: Tuesday December 29, 2015, 12:30pm, somewhere in N.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/227474067\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":6300000,"name":"Friday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"mvjjglyvcbcb","time":1451668500000,"updated":1451682089000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"West Newton","address_1":"1326 Washington Street","name":"FUSN","lon":-71.227585,"id":22732022,"state":"MA","lat":42.349098,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.0978975296,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447779312000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>DRUM IN<br\/>HEALING, PEACE, RENEWAL,<br\/>YOUR DREAMS AND INTENTIONS<br\/>FOR THE NEW YEAR!<\/b><\/p> <p><b> on Friday, January 1, 2016<\/b><br\/>at FUSN - First Unitarian Society in Newton<br\/>1326 Washington St, Newton, MA 02465<br\/>www.fusn.org (617)[masked]<\/p> <p><b>Hosted by<br\/>The Keepers of The Rhythm<\/b><\/p> <p>Potluck from 12:30 to 2:00 p.m.<br\/>Drumming Circle from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m.<br\/>(Drumming experience not necessary.)<\/p> <p><b>Please bring:<\/b><br\/>A healthy vegetarian dish and\/or drink to share.<br\/>Drums and other instruments of your choice.<br\/>(Percussion instruments will also be available.)<br\/>Intentions, visions, prayers, sacred objects.<br\/>A dancing spirit, an open heart, and the shaman within.<\/p> <p>$10 requested to help defray costs.<br\/>$5 suggested for children under age 16.

We will explore the area trails for about 2 or 3 hours. Bring micro-spikes and, if there is sufficient snow,\u00a0snowshoes!\u00a0Dress appropriately for the weather as this is January in NH!\u00a0There will be nice views of Lake Massabessic (that you don't see other times of the year on these trails)\u00a0and animal tracks if there is snow. The Red Arrow restaurant in Londonderry is open on New Year's Day for those who want to get a bite to eat afterwards.<\/p> <p>*Rain or Blizzard conditions cancel the hike.*<\/p> <p>Massabesic Lake covers around 2, 561 acres and provides the drinking water for Manchester, NH so there is no swimming.\u00a0The lake holds more than 15 billion gallons of water and is\u00a05.6 miles long with a width\u00a0of 1.3 miles.<br\/>The average depth of the lake is 196 feet and\u00a0there are 6 main islands around the lake and several smaller islands.<br\/>The main islands are Grape, Fletcher, Brown, Birch, Picnic and Loon.<\/p> <p>The name Lake Massabesic came from the\u00a0Native Americans\u00a0and it means \u201cthe place of much water.\u201d One of the most famous chief\u2019s of the state, chief Passaconaway was killed on Lake Massabesic. He was in a canoe headed to Loon Island. The chief had memories of Look Island from when he was younger. A thunderstorm came along and lightning hit the canoe and the chief and the canoe instantly disintegrated. During the American Civil War, NH troops gathered, camped and trained\u00a0around Lake Massabesic before participating in the war. There is a section of the lake called Battery Point with building remains.<\/p> <p>****By signing up and\/or attending this hike you agree to the Liability Waiver Below:<br\/>Remember: Your Event Organizers \u00a0are volunteers.\u00a0You are solely responsible for your own safety and enjoyment.

Furthermore, participants are encouraged to bring their favorite words in English and learn their translations in Chinese characters. Participants will practice writing the characters on paper. Afterword, the best characters will be designated \u201cyour artwork of the day\u201d. All will love the feel of each stroke and be amazed by power of each on as well as their meaning for the heart and for your well-being. Please come and learn this unique method of self-empowerment and healing in this creative and dynamic class. This workshop is appropriate for anyone age 10 and above. Children under 10 may be admitted with the instructor\u2019s prior approval. - RSVP \u2013 ([masked])<br\/>Participants will receive hand written Chinese calligraphy.

Dr. Yung-Chi Sung M.A., Ph.D.<br\/>Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Yung-Chi grew up in a family of teachers. His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature. This may explain how and why he developed a mind that simultaneously admired arts and appreciated the sciences. Dr. Sung has a B.S. in Psychology from Soochow University in Taipei, , an M.A. in Linguistics (with a minor in Cognitive Science), an M.A. in Educational Psychology (with a minor in Psychology), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in Psychological Foundation, Learning, and Cognition, and a minor in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Psychology). He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students. He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative. From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives. Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015. He is also an Associate Professor at NWHSU. He is currently developing a not-for-profit organization (YUAN3 CHIH4 EDUCATION) to promote global sharing of educational and health care resources. In his spare time he enjoys reading, writing, dreaming, dancing (recently salsa and argentine tango), and occasionally playing poker (currently no-limit Texas Hold\u2019em).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonchina\/events\/227703870\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Spiritual Art of Chinese Calligraphy and Tai Chi (New Year 2016 workshop)","id":"227703870","time":1451750400000,"updated":1451758655000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286765768000,"name":"The Boston China Interest Network \u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5174\u8da3\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1720042,"urlname":"bostonchina","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"32 Quincy Street","name":"Fogg Museum","lon":-71.114433,"id":23703261,"state":"MA","lat":42.374737,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.49156069756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451492042000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Urban Sketchers!<\/p> <p>Let's start the new year of sketching with a trip to the Fogg Museum in Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>The Fogg Museum is FREE to all MA residents on Saturdays from 10am - 12pm, so please bring a valid form of ID.<\/p> <p>The plan is to meet in the lobby of the Fogg Museum around 11:15-11:30am.

She is a Shamanic Practicioner, Legally Certified Spiritual Healer, Reiki Certified And Professionally Certified Sound Healer.

Sarah travels extensively to pursue her studies, share the magic of sound as a healing tool and to recharge and continue her spiritual nomadic path in service and dedication. REVIEWS -<\/p> <p>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood!<br\/>Sara you are an angel among angels.<br\/>I am grateful. Thank you 3. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>4. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>5. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>6. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/227584894\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"Women's Sound Bath to set Your Intentions for 2016","id":"227584894","time":1451764800000,"updated":1451951323000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","city":"Brookline","phone":"617 734-2501","address_1":"290 Harvard St","name":"Coolidge Corner Theater","lon":-71.122505,"id":726945,"state":"MA","lat":42.342934,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":2.93505835533,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450828227000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Presented in glorious Ultra Panavision 70mm, complete with an overture and intermission!

We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations.

The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and morning of the 4th. The second quarter moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year, but it could still be a good show if you are patient. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>April 22, 23 - Lyrids Meteor Shower. The Lyrids is an average shower, usually producing about 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet C\/1861 G1 Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce bright dust trails that last for several seconds. Unfortunately this year the glare from the full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Lyra, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>May 6, 7 - Eta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower, capable of producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rate can reach about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet Halley, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The new moon will ensure dark skies this year for what could be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>July 28, 29 - Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Delta Aquarids is an average shower that can produce up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August 23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. The second quarter moon will block most of the fainter meteors this year but if you are patient you should still be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>August 12, 13 - Perseids Meteor Shower. The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe, producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will set shortly after midnight, leaving fairly dark skies for should be an excellent early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 7 - Draconids Meteor Shower. The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The first quarter moon will block the fainter meteors in the early evening. It will set shortly after midnight leaving darker skies for observing any lingering stragglers. Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 21, 22 - Orionids Meteor Shower.

The shower runs annually from October 2 to November 7. It peaks this year on the night of October 21 and the morning of October 22. The second quarter moon will block some of the fainter meteors this year, but the Orionids tend to be fairly bright so it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 4, 5 - Taurids Meteor Shower. The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks this year on the the night of November 4. The first quarter moon will set just after midnight leaving dark skies for viewing. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 17, 18 - Leonids Meteor Shower. The Leonids is an average shower, producing up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The waning gibbous moon will block many of the fainter meteors this year, but if you are patient you should be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>December 13, 14 - Geminids Meteor Shower. The Geminids is the king of the meteor showers. It is considered by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 multicolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1982. The shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The nearly full moon will block out many of the fainter meteors this year, but the Geminids are so bright and numerous that it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>Source(s):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EverydaySpacer-com2\/events\/225006035\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Next Meteor Shower","id":"225006035","time":1451884500000,"updated":1451896413000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369503037000,"name":"Everyday Spacer Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":8638442,"urlname":"EverydaySpacer-com2","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Everyday Spacers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Anywhere","address_1":"1 Anywhere Rd","name":"Anywhere dark and looking North-East","lon":-71.382439,"id":24279635,"state":"MA","lat":42.407211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.309009552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451805387000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The annual Quadrantid shower is nominally active during the first week of January, and is best seen from northerly latitudes.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/227555289\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlyvcbgb","time":1451952000000,"updated":1451965270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.73765230179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435257950000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the monthly business meeting of SpeakOUT.<\/p> <p><br\/>All members are invited to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you want a copy of the agenda beforehand, contact [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SpeakOUT\/events\/227494030\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Monthly SpeakOUT Board Meeting","id":"ghlwhlyvcbgb","time":1451952000000,"updated":1451960343000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391592871000,"name":"SpeakOUT","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":12729592,"urlname":"SpeakOUT","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Speakers & Other Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"290 Main Street","name":"Cosi","lon":-71.085854,"id":19455362,"state":"MA","lat":42.362373,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.827825188637,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445544170000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is our brand new\u00a0<b>auxiliary\u00a0<\/b>meetup event. \u00a0This is a great opportunity to socialize and play games in a relaxed environment -- and best of all, there's no cap on attendance.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/8\/600_436680296.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are a casual group of people who enjoy playing\u00a0<b>complex\u00a0<\/b>board games -- the kind of board games that\u00a0make you think.\u00a0We play a variety of games, but the games at this particular event are going to be\u00a0<b>on the smaller side<\/b>\u00a0-- because those are often the games that work best in a cafe setting.<\/p> <p>Our main meetup requires RSVPs due to heavy popularity and finite space. \u00a0This event runs simultaneously, two buildings away. \u00a0<b>RSVPs are NOT required for this event.<\/b>\u00a0 RSVPs are still appreciated so the event hosts know how many people to expect, but you don't need to update them and can come even if you don't RSVP.<\/p> <p>This event takes place once a week\u00a0(alternating Mondays and Wednesdays), from 7:00 - 9:30 or 10. \u00a0Cosi closes at 10, but after 9:30,\u00a0<b>you are welcome to come and join the regular meetup at that point,<\/b>\u00a0no RSVP required.<\/p> <p>Cosi Cafe has graciously allowed us to use their back seating area every week. \u00a0You are not required to buy anything from them, but their food is honestly pretty good, so please take advantage of them if you are hungry for dinner, soft drinks, or snacks.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/b\/600_436680299.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We play whatever people bring, but you don't have to bring anything -- the hosts will always have a bag of games with them! \u00a0Some games that you might expect to see here include:<\/p> <p><i>Red 7, Love Letter, Codenames, Pictomania, The Resistance, Avalon, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Bang!, Glory to Rome, Innovation, Mottainai, Chrononaughts, Time Lines, Tash-Kalar<\/i><\/p> <p>If you're looking for longer or larger Euros (like 7 Wonders, Puerto Rico, or Terra Mystica), check out our regular \"Game Night\" meetup.<\/p> <p>If you haven't played these kind of games before, but think you'll like them, you're welcome too! \u00a0But be aware that you are\u00a0<b>NOT\u00a0<\/b>likely to find traditional American games (like Monopoly, Sorry, Risk, or Poker); heavy strategy or negotiation games (like 18xx, wargames, or Diplomacy); or pure abstract games (like Chess).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/9\/600_436680297.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>OUTBOUND (from Boston \/ from Park Street)<\/b><br\/>Take the Red Line to Kendall Square station.

Should it be considered a security risk? Is it good or bad for the host country?<\/p> <p>Many of these questions have been eclipsed by a polarized view of the migration crisis. No one leaves the safety of his or her country without a pretty serious reason. Currently, the main cause is armed conflict in the Middle East and Africa, but there are many reasons for migration: famine, poverty and unstable governments.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227633622\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvcbgb","time":1451953800000,"updated":1452009113000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Peabody ","address_1":"Right off Highway 128.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

It\u2019s the suppression of this innocent natural development that Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven poignantly examines in her first feature, MUSTANG, winner of the Europa Cinemas Label award at the Cannes Directors\u2019 Fortnight.<br\/>The film opens in a remote Turkish coastal village on the Black Sea as the school year ends for five sisters. But this will not be a summer filled with fun and childhood mischief. When a neighbour observes the long-haired, long-limbed girls at the beach, engaged in what she views as scandalous behaviour, she reports them to their grandmother and uncle, who have been the sisters\u2019 guardians ever since the death of their parents. And so harmless play becomes the catalyst for physical and emotional imprisonment.<br\/>All \u201cinstruments of corruption\u201d and pop-culture artifacts are removed from the house, girly outfits are replaced with formless brown dresses, and, following a brief escape to an all-female soccer match, bars are installed on the windows and gates erected at the home\u2019s entrance. As village aunties visit to instruct the girls in domestic duties and suitors begin to arrive, the house becomes a veritable \u201cwife factory.\u201d The eldest sisters are subjected to virginity tests and married off one by one, and the younger sisters look on in fear, resolving not to succumb to the same fate.<br\/>Co-written by Erg\u00fcven and Alice Winocour, MUSTANG is a sensitive and powerful portrait of sisterhood and burgeoning sexuality. Erg\u00fcven elicits wonderfully naturalistic performances from her mostly non-professional actors, who bring a vibrant, youthful energy to the film. Though the film has distinct echoes of Sofia Coppola\u2019s THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, it nevertheless signals the emergence of a singular and fierce new voice in Turkish cinema.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/227699765\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Mustang    1-5-16  Tue.

Sitting as it does at the center of business and home life, the subject of email is worth exploring in depth.<\/p> <p>We'll begin by talking about the origins of email, and how it evolved from a quick add-on to the ARPANET in the eighties to become a global phenomenon, with 2.5 million emails sent every second (and yes, 1.8 million of those are spam).<\/p> <p>We'll then talk about the different ways of using email, including webmail such as Gmail, mail clients like Outlook, and mixed methods. We'll discuss how to set up an email system that makes sense for you or your customer, starting with the domain name, then choosing the host and client, and taking steps to prevent threats that include spam, lockouts and break-ins. We'll do an in-depth exploration of Outlook as a tool for professionally managing mail throughout its long lifecycle, from arrival to long-term archiving.<\/p> <p>We'll also talk about how email can be an effective tool for outreach and business growth, taking as an example a pro bono email list for a non-profit that has also served a fruitful for-profit advertising function.<\/p> <p>See: <a href=\"http:\/\/bnug.org\/emailtopics.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bnug.org\/emailtopics.html<\/a> for topics he will discuss.<\/p> <p><br\/>About the speaker Adam Frost<\/p> <p>Adam Frost works as the coordinator of Computer Care and Learning, an educationally-oriented computer helping company. While some of our colleagues and competitors encourage \u201coutsourcing\u201d of all computer care to them, we encourage our customers to get to know their computers and train their staff in computer care. We find this helps our customers develop deep skills in computer use as a key part of business strategy and action.<\/p> <p>Computer Care and Learning has a longstanding internship program, where we train people to be skilled computer helpers, and we also help run the Get Connected! clinic, which provides refurbished computers to customers with low and moderate incomes. \u00a0<\/p> <p>To learn more, come to the meeting, call Adam's company\u00a0 at[masked], or email [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>-steve<\/p> <p>Steve Isenberg<\/p> <p>President, BNUG<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/B-N-U-G\/events\/227666818\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"eMail: Past - Present - Future","id":"227666818","time":1452036600000,"updated":1452048193000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1365885140000,"name":"Greater Boston Network Users Group","group_lon":-71.2699966431,"id":8049982,"urlname":"B-N-U-G","group_lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Technical Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":15,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1450821410000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>So here you are, conscious of the systemic racism in the US and beyond, and doing what you can to confront it.\u00a0 The more you pay attention, the more you see there are many ways to get involved.\u00a0 Sometimes it can get overwhelming.\u00a0 How do you determine the ways you'll get involved?\u00a0 What are the limits you allow yourself to have?\u00a0 What are the challenges you find most difficult to overcome?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll discuss these questions and other ones that come up from the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If we have different races in the room, we may decide to meet with affinity groups.<\/p> <p>Bring your experiences and your willingness to be real.\u00a0 This is not about shame, but about how we recognize our practices.\u00a0 It is difficult not to be complicit with the racism perpetuated all the time.\u00a0 How do we hold that and keep fighting?<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Accessibility Information:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.communitychangeinc.org\/\">Community Change, Inc.<\/a>\u00a0is wheelchair accessible with the following limitations.\u00a0 The door to the building is heavy and does not have a button to open it.

The truth is, they\u2019re not going anywhere any time soon. There are endless desperate sellers right in your own back yard who would LOVE to have you fix their problem by negotiating a pennies-on-the-dollar payoff with their banks \u2013 and don\u2019t care one bit that you\u2019ll make tens of thousands of dollars in the process.<\/p> <p>The problem is, most short sale education makes it sound like every deal you do will be quick, easy, painless, and successful \u2013 and according to Jason Roberts\u00a0(and many other real life short sale investors we know), that\u2019s just not the whole truth.

The truth is, they\u2019re not going anywhere any time soon. There are endless desperate sellers right in your own back yard who would LOVE to have you fix their problem by negotiating a pennies-on-the-dollar payoff with their banks \u2013 and don\u2019t care one bit that you\u2019ll make tens of thousands of dollars in the process.<\/p> <p>The problem is, most short sale education makes it sound like every deal you do will be quick, easy, painless, and successful \u2013 and according to Jason Roberts\u00a0(and many other real life short sale investors we know), that\u2019s just not the whole truth. Jason is one of the few short sale\/pre-foreclosure experts you\u2019ll ever meet who\u2019s honest about the pros and cons \u2013 and tells you how to meet the challenges of this strategy head-on and he will explain:<\/p> <p>Why some short sale deals are no-brainer money-makers and some are a complete waste of your time \u2013 and how to tell the difference BEFORE you spend a bunch of time \u201cnegotiating\u201d deals that should be left for dead.Why good systems are key to working multiple short sales at once \u2013 and why working multiple deals at once is more profitable and easier than doing one at a time.How to identify the right sellers, properties, and lenders to work with, so you can make a 6-figure income negotiating short sales this year!And much, much more!<\/p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<\/p> <p><b>We have merged with the Boston Real Estate Investors Association! <\/b><\/p> <p>The Boston Real Estate Investors Association \u00a0is open to real estate investors of all experience levels who want to meet and continuously learn from other investors and real estate professionals.

Daniel Jay used dyes, chemicals and chemical reactions to create art works inspired by the life and science of Claude-Louis Berthollet, one of the greatest French chemists, born in Talloires in 1748.<\/p> <p>Colleague of Lavoisier, friend and advisor to Napoleon, Berthollet contributed to both theoretical and practical chemistry. He developed the concept of chemical equilibrium and established the nomenclature for chemical compounds that we still use today. He served as director of dye manufacture at the Gobelins tapestry factory, where his work helped to make some of the most beautiful tapestries of their time.<\/p> <p>For this exhibition, Jay drew from Berthollet\u2019s science using dyes from his era such as Indigo, Cochineal, Madder and Turmeric and chemicals such as copper sulfate, alum, tin oxide and liquid bleach (which he invented) that he used for textile and tapestry manufacture. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Daniel Jay<\/b><br\/>Daniel Jay has had parallel careers in science (as a professor at Harvard and now Tufts University) and in art for the past 30 years. In the mid-1980s, he was elected a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows to do both science and art and was provided with both a laboratory and an art studio there. Recently, he began combining his two passions by developing a series of art influenced by science. Titled ARCHEMY\u00a0in Talloires, this current art uses chemicals and chemical reactions\u00a0to make novel marks on paper\u00a0to express how science inspired him throughout his life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions and Parking Information<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Getting here via public transportation (MBTA) Green\u00a0Line<\/b><\/p> <p>Get off at Arlington station.

Learn more about them and about the myriad other sources of free or low-cost on-line education available with the help of the Internet and\/or your local library.<\/p> <p>Curiosity is one of the defining characteristics of our humanity. Given the rising costs of higher education and the many demands placed on our time in modern days, it's not practical to rely on traditional sources of learning to satisfy that curiosity throughout a lifetime.

We socialize and enjoy refreshments until about 7:15, at which point the speakers presents for as long as they choose, usually until 8:00 or so. At this point we pass the mic around and have a group discussion about the topic. When the discussion wraps up, we continue with more refreshments and socializing until around 9:00 when all attendees are welcome to join our open steering committee meeting.<\/p> <p>We \u00a0take donations at the door to cover the cost of the meeting ($5 is suggested). Half of the donations (after we pay the rent) are given as an honorarium to the speaker. All regular attendees are encouraged to bring refreshments to share.<\/p> <p>Note that we have a large mailing list outside of Meetup.com so the RSVP numbers are generally much lower than the actual attendance.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The entrance to the Hall is around to the right side if you are facing the Meeting House front doors.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ConcordAreaHumanists\/events\/222135975\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Maria Greene, \"Lifelong Learning for Free Using the Internet\", First Wed.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.
