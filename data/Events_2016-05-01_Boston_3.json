Unlike any other puppet show you've ever seen before, the hugely popular musical Avenue Q is strictly for grownups. Full of humor and hummable tunes, Avenue Q is a hilarious look at life in New York, featuring a fantastic cast of people and puppets. In its Broadway debut, Avenue Q scored the \"Triple Crown\" of Tony wins, grabbing honors for Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book. The lovable cast of characters, both flesh and felt, includes recent college grad Princeton, who moves to NYC's rent-controlled Avenue Q full of hope for the future, Kate (the girl\/monster next door), and a colorful collection of neighbors who all struggle together to find jobs, dates, and their ever-elusive purpose in life. While the show draws inspiration from a certain beloved children's show, you'll definitely want to leave the kiddos at home for this one -- these puppets have quite the potty mouths on them, and there's even some \"full puppet nudity\" involved. Head to Rogers Center for the Arts for a night of very adult laughs as you get schooled on topics such as unemployment, relationships, one night stands and casual racism.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/2\/1\/600_447009505.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"General admission tickets, if we meet by 1:30 we can get seats together!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Theater-Goers\/events\/228982833\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"See Avenue Q - $5 Tickets!","id":"228982833","time":1461432600000,"updated":1461543686000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424994452000,"name":"Boston Theater-Goers","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":18463910,"urlname":"Boston-Theater-Goers","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Theater-Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1640 Cambridge St","name":"Cambridge War Memorial Recreation Center","lon":-71.10984,"id":4267222,"state":"MA","lat":42.374767,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.28002953529,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459472238000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We're doing a new 4-week endurance series!

Please feel free to join even if you haven't read the book.

Many people rank with Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson. Unlike those cases, Buck v. Bell is still the law of the land.<\/p> <p>In 1927, an 8-1 decision written by Justice Oliver Wendall Holmes Jr, notoriously ruled that \"three generations of imbeciles is enough\" while upholding the forced sterilization of Carrie Buck, a young woman of above average intelligence who demonstrated her low moral character and imbecility by being an unwed mother, bearing the child of her rapist, a nephew of her foster parents. The three generations were her mother, Carrie, and her child who was too young to be evaluated.<\/p> <p>The case was the pinnacle of the American eugenics movement and an inspiration for Hitler's similar laws. It was even cited by the defense in the Nuremburg war crimes trials as justification for the Holocaust.<\/p> <p>It is becoming increasingly relevant with the rise in immigrant bashing and pseudo science raised to national policy.<\/p> <p>For more information, see the editorial reviews and comments (including one conspiricy-minded anti-vaxer) on the Amazon page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Imbeciles-Supreme-American-Eugenics-Sterilization\/dp\/1594204187\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Imbeciles-Supreme-American-Eugenics-Sterilization\/dp\/1594204187<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Room 169 (the doors are locked on the weekend but we put up post-its with a phone number to get access).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSkeptics\/events\/229946613\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Boston Skeptics' Book Club: Imbeciles by Adam Cohen","id":"229946613","time":1461438000000,"updated":1461447095000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429582122000,"name":"Boston Skeptics","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18556723,"urlname":"BostonSkeptics","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Skeptics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"142 Berkeley St # 22","name":"Room To Grow","lon":-71.071884,"id":7851022,"state":"MA","lat":42.348858,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":0.777514755726,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460400819000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>On April 23rd, we have partnered with MeetVolunteers\u00a0to\u00a0have a volunteering event at\u00a0Room\u00a0to\u00a0Grow!\u00a0Room\u00a0to\u00a0Grow\u00a0(142 Berkeley Street) is a nonprofit organization dedicated\u00a0to\u00a0enriching the lives of babies born into poverty throughout their critical first three years of development.

Please notice that if it's rain, this event may be cancelled or rescheduled.<\/p> <p>Update on April 21 Wednesday:<\/p> <p>The cherry trees in the park has started to blossom, so this weekend should be a good time to go there to watch it. \u00a0A bad news is that we can not picnic in the park although the park seems to be not very strict. \u00a0You can eat foods like sandwich, but basically no picnic allowed, a park officer told me. \u00a0There is a nice cafe by the park entrance and can have meals. \u00a0So, we do not bring pizza or big lunch boxes. \u00a0If you want to bring snack and a food like sandwich, I think it's fine. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Any opinion or suggestion?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDirections:<\/p> <p>By Car: Parking is available outside the main gate, along the Arborway, and around the Arboretum\u2019s perimeter. More\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arboretum.harvard.edu\/visit\/hours-services-and-policies\/\">parking information<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>By MBTA: \u00a0Public Transportation: Take the T to Forest Hills. Exit the upper level of the station and cross South Street. Turn right on South Street and head uphill, parallel to the exit ramp, to the Forest Hills Gate.<\/p> <p>By Bus:Take the #39 bus to the South Street and Custer Avenue stop in Jamaica Plain (just after the monument stop). Walk back a few feet to the intersection and turn left on Custer Street. At the end of Custer Street (three blocks) you\u2019ll be facing the Arboretum. Turn right and proceed to the pedestrian crossing. After the crossing, turn right. The Arboretum\u2019s main gate will be 10 yards ahead, on the left.<\/p> <p>\n\nFor more information:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arboretum.harvard.edu\/visit\/directions\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.arboretum.harvard.edu\/visit\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.arboretum.harvard.edu\/visit\/directions\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Arnold Arboretum is big, and I have not found the place where we can sit and watch Cherry blossoms yet. \u00a0 So, it may be easier to meet at MBTA Forest Hills station. \u00a0Thank you for Ken who provides the local area's information. \u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/d\/2\/600_449107634.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nKonbanwa, Sam-san. I'm sending you MBTA links, with info about Forest hills. The first link concerns the Orange Line, and shows how the Green and Red Lines connect to Orange Line.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/?route=ORANGE\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/?route=ORANGE\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/?route=ORANGE<\/a><\/a> This second link has info about all the bus lines to and from Forest hills. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/stations\/?stopId=11788\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/stations\/?stopId=11788\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/stations\/?stopId=11788<\/a><\/a> If you guys still plan the event, I think you should meet at Forest Hills, and walk together to Arboretum, because there's a lot of construction going on, and it could be confusing, even though the park is across the street. I hope this is helpful, Ken<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-japanese\/events\/230454456\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"\u304a\u82b1\u898b, Ohanami at Arnold Arboretum in Boston","id":"230454456","time":1461441600000,"updated":1461449913000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1042101769000,"name":"Boston Japanese & English Language Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":86694,"urlname":"boston-japanese","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Japanese\/English Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01905","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lynn","address_1":"157 Walnut Street","name":"Walnut Street Cafe","lon":-70.971886,"id":2961221,"state":"MA","lat":42.470177,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":9.12881851196,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454104180000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is an adult comedy show so please DO NOT invite my mother! hahha!<\/p> <p>The show starts at 8:00 but Robin and I will be leaving Hudson at 5:00 and stopping to eat at The Cheesecake Factory at\u00a0The Burlington Mall on the way.\u00a0 We can meet in Hudson if people want to carpool.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/3\/600_446341155.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/7\/600_446341159.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Central-MA-South-Central-NH-40-60-Gatherings\/events\/228463812\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Naked Truth 2 \"Theatrical Comedy Performance!\" (Mature Audience)","id":"228463812","time":1461445200000,"updated":1461475490000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1369481848000,"name":"Boredom Fighters 40~60","group_lon":-71.5500030518,"id":8635602,"urlname":"North-Central-MA-South-Central-NH-40-60-Gatherings","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Boredom Fighters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"536 Massachusetts Avenue","name":"The Dance Complex","lon":-71.102333,"id":5439092,"state":"MA","lat":42.364189,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.67937517166,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460930794000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This class will cost $5 for First Timers and $7per person.

This is meant to be both about getting to know parts of the city better, as well as being a photography challenge, because these are unglamorous targets compared to, say, the Zakim bridge, and force you to find opportunities to portrait the neighborhoods and architecture in a compelling way. Use this as an opportunity to create a project for yourself (Boston brownstone entry stairs? Night street photography?)<\/p> <p><br\/>Neighborhoods to be visited will include Beacon Hill, East Boston, Fenway, Backbay, Harvard Square and others. If you have suggestions or requests, please email me or post a comment. Mattapan, anyone? :-)<\/p> <p><br\/>The paradigm for these meetups will be to provide you with basic information and some images about the neighborhood, meet as a group to briefly discuss the opportunities, but then spread out to investigate the area, rather than moving in a group. If you do not feel comfortable walking on your own, make sure to tag along with someone in groups of 2-3.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our first neighborhood will be South End, an area of little glamour, but there are two parks (Blackstone and Franklin Sq), a burial ground, an almost-abandoned building (with shops on the bottom), the very impressive Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston Medical Center spanning across Mass Avenue, some industrial looking structures and views on the highway, if you venture far enough. And, of course, a plethora of Boston's brownstone buildings with its neat stairs and doors.<\/p> <p><br\/>Suggested equipment: hiking shoes, you will be walking quite a bit, tripod, intervalometer, camera and a variety of lenses, from fisheyes, wide angles to medium zooms. Tilt-shift lenses or lens babies will be very applicable, if you have those. Dress appropriately for the weather and walking around.<\/p> <p><br\/>Weather forecast will be updated as we get closer. Parking is available on the street or google the nearest garage. Sunset will be at 7:35, we will meet at 8 with a little light left and this is a full-moon evening. Watch the comments for updates.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/0\/2\/600_448869986.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/0\/b\/600_448869995.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/5\/9\/600_448870073.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/5\/d\/600_448870077.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/8\/0\/600_449005472.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/0\/600_449005456.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/5\/e\/600_449005438.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/4\/0\/600_449005408.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/2\/5\/600_449005381.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/0\/1\/600_449005345.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/e\/8\/600_449005320.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/c\/f\/600_449005295.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/a\/d\/600_449005261.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/8\/9\/600_449005225.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/6\/b\/600_449005195.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/230346452\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Boston Neighborhoods: South End","id":"230346452","time":1461456000000,"updated":1461529337000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"74 Warrenton St","name":"Charles Playhouse","lon":-71.066071,"id":23786971,"lat":42.349998,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.721099019051,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460330863000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tickets range from $60-117<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueman.com\/boston\/about-show\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.blueman.com\/boston\/about-show<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Black-Woman-Singles-Group\/events\/230277931\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Blue Man Group","id":"230277931","time":1461456000000,"updated":1461499911000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452085253000,"name":"Black Woman Singles Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":19288294,"urlname":"Black-Woman-Singles-Group","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"680 Huron Avenue","name":"Swing City","lon":-71.153015,"id":1560140,"state":"MA","lat":42.380383,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.47496128082,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446147695000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/swingcityboston.com\/images\/swingcity_logo_new.gif\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/swingcityboston.com\/calendar\/calendar.cgi?make_marquee=1&amp;return_image=1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/swingcityboston.com\/calendar\/calendar.cgi?make_marquee=1&amp;return_image=1<\/a><\/p> <p>Swing City Presents:<br\/><b>Swing Dancing w\/ Live Music!<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Free intro lesson (w\/ cover) from 8-9pm<br\/>Dancing from 9-12<br\/>$16 cover ($12 w\/ valid student ID)<br\/>*note: some events may be a few dollars extra depending on the band and special events.<\/p> <p><br\/>Swing City is Boston's premier Swing dance venue, since 1994.

This time I am looking to take a very small group of people with me for a whole long day of photography in the Big Apple.\u00a0 I will take you on a guided tour of\u00a0some \u00a0well \u00a0known and lesser known\u00a0 photogenic parts of the City\u00a0 and assist you in getting some great shots.<\/p> <p>We will leave at 6am from Staples Parking lot in Weymouth (close to route 3) and I will drive you to New York City where we will spend the rest of the day exploring and photographing.\u00a0 We will \u00a0leave in the evening and head back to Weymouth. I can\u00a0take \u00a0people in relative comfort in my Van.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0standard \u00a0cost of a three hour guided workshop with a professional photographer in Manhattan (\u00a0in a group of 15) \u00a0is $150 and up. \u00a0For just $175 I will be your personal chauffeur and guide for the day in a group limited to\u00a0 just four participants. We will park the van when we arrive in New York so there will be lots of walking involved. \u00a0Please be sure that you are able to be on your feet for several hours (we will take a couple of breaks but expect five to six hours on your feet).\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Detail<\/b><\/p> <p>The price for the guided tour\u00a0and workshop is far less than I often charge for a six hour one day workshop in Pembroke, and you get the advantage of being able to pick my brains for many hours.\u00a0\u00a0 The car pooling to New York and back with me is free of charge and is not part of the workshop which begins and ends when we are out\u00a0of the van and on the\u00a0streets of New York.<\/p> <p>You will be responsible for your own food and refreshments.\u00a0 We will most likely find a suitable cafe or deli for lunch and\/or dinner while in New York.<\/p> <p>You must be willing to meet in Weymouth by 6am and travel with the group.

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front.

Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there.

It travels through 39 communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and is comprised primarily of the historic Mattabesett, Metacomet, and Monadnock (M-M-M) Trails.\u00a0 The route showcases classic New England landscape features: long distance vistas with rural towns as a backdrop, agrarian lands, un-fragmented forests, and large river valleys. The trail also travels through important Native American and colonial historical landmarks and highlights a range of diverse ecosystems and natural resources: trap-rock ridges, mountain summits, forested glades, vernal pools, lakes, streams and waterfalls.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_England_National_Scenic_Trail\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_England_National_Scenic_Trail\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_England_National_Scenic_Trail<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/amcberkshire.org\/netmm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hikesafe.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hikesafe.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.hikesafe.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Directions to Royalston Falls can be found at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetrustees.org\/places-to-visit\/central-ma\/royalston-falls.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetrustees.org\/places-to-visit\/central-ma\/royalston-falls.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thetrustees.org\/places-to-visit\/central-ma\/royalston-falls.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you tracking this series via the AMC Webpage, we're hiking the trail in reverse order, sections 20 and 19.<\/p> <p>Carpooling is welcome.\u00a0 If you would like to carpool you're welcome to post that request in the *Comments* section of this event's page.\u00a0 But please respond to those posts via *Meetup Messenger*.\u00a0 You do that by clicking on a member's profile, then clicking on *message*..<\/p> <p>Cell Phones and Electronic Devices:\u00a0 I ask that while on the BSOT events that I host you limit your use of electronic devices to the following activities:<\/p> <p>Map My Hike or other Hiking Apps, Location Services, Cameras, Weather Apps.<\/p> <p>Of the many pleasant features of being out and about is that we all get away from the constant distractions of cell phones and electronics.\u00a0 I ask that while on the events I host you:<\/p> <p>Do not use your phone (of course!

Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.<\/p> <p>You need a recognizable facial photo as your profile picture in order to participate in this and all Trekkers events.<\/p> <p>Duration: Approximately 8+ hours. However, any time estimate given by an Event Organizer is just that. Actual times vary greatly according to weather, trail conditions and the group itself. Don't sign up if you've scheduled something later in the day. The Organizer is not responsible for getting you back in time.<\/p> <p>There is no way of knowing trail conditions ahead of time. Use your own judgment. Anyone with recurrent \"No Shows\" or about whom we have received complaints from fellow hikers will not be accepted. If you haven't hiked with us before, add yourself to the list if you can adhere to these basic prerequisites. Please don't RSVP \"Yes\" unless you really intend to come. We are committed to being there for you. If you are not equally committed to being there then please don't sign up.<\/p> <p>This hike is rated Moderate. \u00a0You should be able to stay with the group going at a pace of 2+ mph. This is a group event and participants are expected to follow the lead, stay together, stop at junctions or summits, and support all participants should circumstances require teamwork. We start together and finish together. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own. We hike in light rain or showers, but heavy snow or extreme cold weather cancels. Bring water, hiking boots (not sneakers), bug spray and lunch\/snacks. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.<\/p> <p>No dogs and no guests are allowed on hikes. Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please remember that your Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults. The people who have the best times on these hikes are those who stay loose and roll with things as they happen.

It swings right, passing around the<\/p> <p>house and climbs, turning left onto the older route of the trail. It<\/p> <p>turns sharp left where the red-blazed WMNF boundary continues<\/p> <p>straight ahead. It climbs moderately, levels briefly, then ascends a<\/p> <p>steep gravelly section with poor footing. At the top of this pitch it<\/p> <p>turns left and ascends at an easier grade, and the first of several<\/p> <p>outlooks from White\u2019s Ledge. The trail climbs steeply again, with<\/p> <p>gravelly, slippery footing, after passing a large boulder on the right<\/p> <p>of the trail, and it turns sharp right on a ledge, where there is a<\/p> <p>good viewpoint just to the left of the trail and climbing becomes<\/p> <p>easier. It passes about 15 yd. to the right of the true summit of Mt.<\/p> <p>Stanton. The summit area is covered with a fine stand of red<\/p> <p>(Norway) pines, and there are good views from nearby scattered<\/p> <p>ledges.<\/p> <p>to Whites Ledge 44\u00b0 05' 49\" 71\u00b0 13' 23\"<\/p> <p>4.00 mi 2 hr 57 min +363 ft on Mt Stanton Trail<\/p> <p>5.20 mi 3 hr 57 min +1132 ft The trail descends past a north outlook to the Stanton-Pickering<\/p> <p>col, then ascends steadily, crosses a ledgy ridge and descends<\/p> <p>slightly, then climbs steeply and passes 30 yd. to the right of the<\/p> <p>true summit of Mt. Pickering. It then leads to ledges on a slightly<\/p> <p>lower knob, where there are excellent views. The trail descends to<\/p> <p>a minor col, then crosses over several interesting small humps<\/p> <p>sometimes called the Crippies.

It descends somewhat along the north side of the ridge<\/p> <p>toward Mt. Langdon, then climbs north moderately with a few<\/p> <p>steep pitches, passing a restricted outlook to Carter Dome, Carter<\/p> <p>Notch, and Wildcat Mountain. The trail passes about 35 yd. to the<\/p> <p>right of the summit of Mt. Langdon, which is wooded and<\/p> <p>viewless, then descends easily to a gravel slope, turns right, and<\/p> <p>continues downward to a brook that is crossed 60 yd. east of Mt.<\/p> <p>Langdon Shelter, where the Mount Stanton Trail ends.<\/p> <p>to Mt Langdon Shelter 44\u00b0 06' 53\" 71\u00b0 16' 56\"<\/p> <p>0.40 mi 16 min +137 ft on Mt Langdon Trail<\/p> <p>5.60 mi 4 hr 13 min +1269 ft This trail runs to the Mt.

Stanton Trail, and thus gives access to<\/p> <p>both the higher and lower sections of the Montalban Ridge. It<\/p> <p>should be noted that despite its name this trail does not get<\/p> <p>particularly close to the summit of Mt. Langdon, which is crossed<\/p> <p>by the Mt. Stanton Trail. Most of this trail is either within or close<\/p> <p>to the boundary of the Presidential Range\u2013Dry River Wilderness;<\/p> <p>Mt. Langdon Shelter is just outside the Wilderness. In 2011 the<\/p> <p>lower part of this trail had been disrupted by logging, and may<\/p> <p>require considerable care to follow through the logged areas.<\/p> <p>The Mt. Langdon Trail and the Mt. Stanton Trail both begin at the<\/p> <p>WMNF Mt. Langdon Shelter, capacity eight. Some care is<\/p> <p>required to follow the trail near the shelter. Water may be found in<\/p> <p>a brook 60 yd. from the shelter on the Mt. Stanton Trail, although<\/p> <p>in dry weather the brook bed may have to be followed downhill for<\/p> <p>a distance.

It then leads<\/p> <p>through a recently logged area, where it may be difficult to follow<\/p> <p>through a confusing network of skid roads. In general, the trail<\/p> <p>follows the main road south.

The games will start around 11am depending on the amount of teams entered. Games should end around 1:30pm.<\/p> <p>The 7th week will be a championship round where all the prizes will be awarded to the winning teams. Much of this is still TBD, but I can tell you The Sinclair has offered tickets to an upcoming show as part of the championship team's package. There will also be other prizes donated by our sponsors.<\/p> <p>Teams will be comprised of 4 to 8 players. If you have a group of 4 people that will be there every week, then you may have enough players for a team. If you feel you won't be able to make it every week, then you should be on a team with more members so each week your team can have at least 4 players present.<\/p> <p>The easiest and cheapest way to create a team is for a team captain to log onto the American Bocce Co website and pay a $260 team fee. They will also pick a cool team name &amp; slogan too. Then after the captain creates the team on the website, the rest of the players on the team join, and pay the team captain their share. This works out to $65 each for a 4 player team, down to $32.50 each for an 8 player team. That's somewhere between $9 to $5 bucks a week. Quite a bargain for such a fun, professionally run social sports league! Couple this with the fact that The Sinclair will also be offering brunch specials from their kitchen for all bocce players, and you have one heck of a deal!<\/p> <p>If a team pays in increments they will pay transaction fees which equate to about $4 for each player.<\/p> <p>Note: No matter how a team pays, or how many players there are, every player needs to be registered on the American Bocce Co website.

With the goal of a creating a Japanese cultural festival that will thrive for the next 100 years, the Japanese and Japanese-American community in Boston has come together to create an event that introduces many forms of Japan, including its traditional and pop culture, business and industry, and much more.<\/p> <p>Compared to last year, the festival will be even bigger.

We'll also discuss any necessary changes to the dues policy and group riding etiquette while on rides, among several other topics. Please consider joining us for this all-important organizational meeting for the continued success of our group. I am told that some members have had problems paying their annual dues, please bring your dues with you to the meeting, and I'll see to it that your membership is renewed.<br\/>Weather permitting, we'll take a leisurely ride together immediately following the meeting. There are several beautiful coastal towns near our meeting point in Hanover.

Salem in the 19th century was The Place, experiencing a true eruption of genius. This walk will visit and view sites associated with three 19th century Salem geniuses \u2013 Nathaniel Hawthorne [masked]), Nathaniel Bowditch [masked]), and Alexander Graham Bell [masked]).<\/p> <p>Hawthorne, born and raised in Salem, was a direct descendent of the Salem Witch Trials judge John Hathorne, and Nathaniel \u00a0could not escape the legacy of the witch trial era. His renowned books (<i>The Scarlett Letter<\/i>, <i>The House of the Seven Gables<\/i>) often featured moral conflicts arising from Puritan doctrines. We will pass and view many sites associated with Hawthorne \u2013 the House of the Seven Gables, the Custom House, his birthplace house, his childhood home, and more.<\/p> <p>Bowditch, also born and raised in Salem, was the premier mathematician of his time, and is considered the founder of modern maritime navigation. His most famous work, <i>The New American Practical Navigator<\/i>, first published in 1802, is still in print and is carried on board every commissioned U.S. Naval vessel. We will pass and view sites associated with the life of Bowditch \u2013 the Bowditch House where he lived most of his adult life, his birthplace home, the Maritime Historic site from where Bowditch made his many sea voyages.<\/p> <p>Although Bell spent most of his life outside Salem, he spent the critical years when the telephone was first conceived and created living in Salem. There he tutored deaf students during the day, one of whom was to later become his wife, and tinkered at night in a small lab next to his Salem home, commuting between there and a larger laboratory in Boston. The first ever \u2018long-distance\u2019 phone call, between Salem and Boston, was made Feb[masked] from the Salem Lyceum, which still stands. That call convinced attending investors that Bell was onto something, and so Salem can be considered the birthplace of Ma Bell.<\/p> <p>This walk will be shorter than the previous walk, staying in downtown Salem. Parking is available nearby at Ferry Wharf, home of the Sculpture Garden (another Salem genius?) visited on the previous walk.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Town-Explorers\/events\/230328710\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":7200000,"name":"Geniuses of Salem Walking Tour","id":"230328710","time":1461517200000,"updated":1461556468000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455310170000,"name":"North Shore Town Explorers","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":19560966,"urlname":"North-Shore-Town-Explorers","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"City Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":12.8307189941,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438208954000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>PLEASE NOTE: As of 04\/03\/2016, our weekend MJ sessions have moved to Danvers -- we are no longer meeting in Saugus.

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

What is the difference? When you show someone a good photo of a blossom they say, oh that's nice. When you show them a great photo, they are touched, moved and inspired by the beauty of the image you have created. In this class you will discover how to really see and capture beauty in bloom.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Can you feel the quality of tenderness and quiet in the image above? \u00a0This is because of the composition and because I\u00a0paid attention to the way the\u00a0light was playing\u00a0across the surface\u00a0of the petals in that moment. \u00a0You have to really slow down to see the subtle beauty and that is what I help will do.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/1\/4\/600_449125620.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>In this image I used a shallow depth of field to divide the visual space into a one third, two thirds composition. Again the blue space is key to giving the eye a space to rest and refresh. \u00a0And by luck I caught the honey bee.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/3\/2\/600_245575602.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Blossoms are a special subject for photography because they can tell a story, evoke an emotion and invite us to express our creativity. This macro shot captures the subtle shapes and color gradations of a single blossom. \u00a0It takes time to create an image like this but is well worth it. You don't have to be an artist to see like one. In this class I will reveal the simple but effective ways you can see more creatively and express your love of beauty through your photos. There will be three creative lesson assignments designed to build your skills and give you a few new tools to work with.\u00a0 <b>In the fun and informative class you will discover:<\/b> How to capture the translucent, ephemeral quality of a blossom<br\/>How to compose the shot for the greatest impact and drama<br\/>How to use color, texture and shape to express the beauty of blossoms<\/p> <p>More advanced students will also work with panning to blur the blossoms as a background, and boken as a method of creating dots of light in the background.<\/p> <p>Panning to blur the blossoms as a background for action shots.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/1\/600_449103745.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/600_449103686.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Creative technique of Boken creates interesting background dots of light.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/2\/7\/600_449125639.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Monochromatic effect using the branches to create structure and form. The empty space in the bottom right corner is essential to the success of the image. The eye needs a space to rest.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The class size will be small so you will also receive individual attention and critique so you can immediately improve the quality of your photos.\u00a0 \u00a0This is an intuitive approach to creative seeing, not a technical workshop. But, I can also help you move off the Auto setting on your camera and use aperture priority if you would like to experiment with shallow depth of field. I will guide you step by step through a simple process of seeing creatively that you can use from now on not only when you photography blossoms, but other subjects as well. In this image for example I included the silhouette of the bird and the dark branches to add dynamic contrast.\u00a0 <img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/4\/8\/600_449103912.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhy not make this the Spring your photos go from good to GREAT!

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

they can select some approaches for more in-depth study and application to their lives; they can practice, support, and share a particular approach with other members; and they can return to PGN to explore different approaches or to work on other parts of their life. \u00a0<\/p> <p>PGN is also a community of like-hearted people who share an important, but not widely distributed, combination of values and characteristics (e.g.,\u00a0curiosity, willingness to learn,\u00a0willingness\u00a0to change habits)\u00a0around consciously and proactively crafting a life well-lived. \u00a0For people with this important combination of characteristics, engaging with other members of the community can be fascinating, supportive, and affirming.<\/p> <p>And finally, PGN is a toolbox with which members can create successful events. \u00a0Members can create workshops, practice groups, and social events through which they can\u00a0share their journey, their gifts, their joy, their successes, their vision, and their interests.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Orientation Series<\/b><\/p> <p>Given the enormous ambition and power of the Personal Growth Network, and its rapid growth, it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed at first, so we offer some \"How-To\" guides to maximize your utilization of the Personal Growth Network for whatever your goals may be. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Our Orientations include<\/b>:<\/p> <p><i>For Participants<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Wed May 4:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/229992061\/\">Newbie Introduction<\/a>\u00a0<br\/>. . .

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

They are a set of standalone tiles, with the ability to communicate to their adjacent neighbors and then determine their future state from their current state. Given a simple set of rules, such as \u201cblue tiles are only happy, (or flashing) when touching two or more tiles that are of a color other than blue,\u201d the tiles can show the state of a board game, updating in realtime. \u00a0They are a platform for playing hands on with dynamic systems and we would love to see what other game designers can come up with on the platform. Tiles can also have probabilistic logic, or change properties based on user interaction. Each tile is essentially a tiny computer which can respond to touch, or sound, communicate with neighboring tiles, and display the RGB spectrum. We have developed an API for quickly prototyping rulesets on the tiles, so we can brainstorm types of games and even implement them to play test.<\/p> <p><br\/>More information is available at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/automatiles.com\/\">AutomaTiles.com<\/a>\u00a0and on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jbobrow\/AutomaTiles\/tree\/master\/CodeSketches\/API\">GitHub<\/a>\u00a0Note: this is my Masters Thesis work at MIT Media Lab Playful Systems Group.\"<\/p> <p>--\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Venue Details<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><i>MIT Media Lab (E14) (Room 240)\u00a0<\/i><i>75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02139<\/i><\/p> <p><i>(corner of Ames and Amherst, a 45 second walk from the Kendall stop on the Red Line)<\/i><\/p> <p>If you have any questions or\u00a0if you have any trouble getting in, feel free to call or text us at:<\/p> <p><br\/>Jonathan:\u00a0[masked] (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>Jeff:[masked]\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"MIT Media Lab (E14) (Room 240) 75 Amherst St,  Cambridge, MA 02139","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Game-Makers-Guild\/events\/230557772\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":5400000,"name":"[New Venue] AutomaTiles: Game Design Challenge Presentation and Brainstorm","id":"230557772","time":1461623400000,"updated":1461629846000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294953487000,"name":"Game Makers Guild","group_lon":-71.0800018311,"id":1765339,"urlname":"Game-Makers-Guild","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Game Makers and Playtesters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02451","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Waltham","address_1":"380 Winter Street \/ Totten Pond Road","name":"Copper House Tavern","lon":-71.24772,"id":16888832,"state":"MA","lat":42.395153,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.40968322754,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461194862000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>**Scott Wakefield will be hosting this event.**<\/p> <p>We will be meeting at the top of the Copperhouse Tavern parking lot at 6:30 PM.

Today, while the martial art has been separated from the religion, the practice of Shorinji Kempo remains true to it's Zen Buddhist roots, with philosophy and meditation still integral to the study in the dojo of hard (punches, kicks and blocks) and soft techniques (releases, joint locks and throws).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Shorinji-Kempo\/events\/230503317\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Boston Shorinji Kempo Open Dojo Event","id":"nmqjhlyvgbhc","time":1461625200000,"updated":1461637857000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1419521699000,"name":"Shorinji Kempo Meetup","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18273143,"urlname":"Shorinji-Kempo","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Shorinji Kempo Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01970","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Salem","address_1":"254 Essex Street, Suite 204","name":"Essence of Healing","lon":-70.896767,"id":12620772,"state":"MA","lat":42.521461,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":14.258310318,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457362015000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for a guided meditation to help you achieve a state of well-being, relaxation, and strengthen your connection to self.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Each week, Elaine &amp; Nicol alternate leading the group in a guided meditation to induce a deepened state of relaxation, healing on all levels.\u00a0 You can achieve an expanded state of self and a higher state of consciousness, connecting you to the ALL that IS!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Elaine and Nicol are able to connect with the most highest vibrations and frequencies of light\u00a0that serves the group as a whole.\u00a0 Your personal experience will be enhanced by the group setting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>All levels of meditators are welcome to join us.\u00a0 A sacred space is created to help you feel safe and comfortable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please RSVP your intention on attending.\u00a0 Cost is $5 at the door.\u00a0 Doors open at 6:45pm with the group staring at 7pm!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Visit our website for more info <a href=\"http:\/\/www.essencehealing.net\/\">www.essencehealing.net<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/229921792\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Weekly Meditation Group","id":"tqvgrlyvgbhc","time":1461625200000,"updated":1461954876000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Ashland","address_1":"27 Tri St","name":"The Tipi","lon":-71.428436,"id":24377840,"state":"MA","lat":42.244778,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":20.0129356384,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455914059000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Why join a men's circle?

He will talk about why we need to work with viruses in labs under high containment, why vaccines are amazingly effective and have saved countless lives, and that you can't trust celebrities (cough*Jenny McCarthy*cough) on topics like this.<\/p> <p>In addition to his role at NEIDL, Paul Duprex is a Professor of Microbiology in the Department of Microbiology at Boston University School of Medicine. He is a molecular virologist with nearly twenty-five years\u2019 experience. His PhD and post-doctoral work involved studies of foot and mouth disease virus and the now eradicated rinderpest virus. This required animal biosafety level four (ABSL-4) training at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, UK. His interests in working in biocontainment continue and he is currently undergoing mentored BSL-4 training at NEIDL.<\/p> <p>From 1999 until 2010 he was a Lecturer\/Senior Lecturer in Molecular Virology at The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. During this time he took a one-year leave of absence and worked for Johnson and Johnson (J&amp;J) as Head of the Department of Emerging Sciences and Technologies at TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA, USA.<\/p> <p>His research focuses on understanding the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis and vaccine attenuation, with a view to developing rationally attenuated vaccines. His interest in animal virology continues and he is actively studying barriers which restrict cross-species transmission events, with the aim of developing tools to predict pathogen evolution. He works primarily on human and animal paramyxoviruses such as measles, mumps, human respiratory syncytial and canine distemper viruses. He has received funding from DHS, DARPA, BBSRC, MRC, NIH, The Wellcome Trust, Zoetis LLC and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges in Global Health Program.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/230322159\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"xfbvslyvgbhc","time":1461625200000,"updated":1461637823000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"357 Main St.","name":"The Savings Bank","lon":-71.071297,"id":24449130,"state":"MA","lat":42.504147,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.98018836975,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460467490000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>On Monday April 25th, 2016 The Lakesiders Toastmasters Club of Wakefield will be holding our biweekly meeting at a special location - The Savings Bank at 357 Main Street in Wakefield. \u00a0Doors open at 6:30pm, meeting starts promptly at 7:00pm and runs until 9:00.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The public is encouraged to attend to observe, participate or to get more information.\u00a0 Refreshments will be served and club officers and members will be available to answer any guest questions.<\/p> <p>For more information please contact us at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/lakesiders.toastmastersclubs.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lakesiders.toastmastersclubs.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lakesiders.toastmastersclubs.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Visit us on Facebook:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lakesiderstoastmasters\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lakesiderstoastmasters\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lakesiderstoastmasters<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lakesiders-Toastmasters-Meetup\/events\/230315733\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Lakesiders Toastmasters Meetup","id":"230315733","time":1461625200000,"updated":1461637821000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1459862166000,"name":"Lakesiders Toastmasters Meetup","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19802911,"urlname":"Lakesiders-Toastmasters-Meetup","group_lat":42.5,"who":"Lakesiders Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"665 Washington Street","name":"Jaho Coffee Roasters & Wine Bar","lon":-71.063011,"id":24112236,"state":"MA","lat":42.351761,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.67327940464,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450136718000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Android developers get together for informal discussion of mobile technologies.

Ave., Cambridge<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Harvard Book Store welcomes ROBERT C. BERWICK, Professor of Computational Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering at MIT, and renowned author, logician, and philospher NOAM CHOMSKY for a discussion of their book, Why Only Us: Language and Evolution.<\/p> <p>About Why Only Us<\/p> <p>We are born crying, but those cries signal the first stirring of language. Within a year or so, infants master the sound system of their language; a few years after that, they are engaging in conversations. This remarkable, species-specific ability to acquire any human language\u2014\"the language faculty\"\u2014raises important biological questions about language, including how it has evolved. This book by two distinguished scholars\u2014a computer scientist and a linguist\u2014addresses the enduring question of the evolution of language.<\/p> <p>Robert Berwick and Noam Chomsky explain that until recently the evolutionary question could not be properly posed, because we did not have a clear idea of how to define \"language\" and therefore what it was that had evolved. But since the Minimalist Program, developed by Chomsky and others, we know the key ingredients of language and can put together an account of the evolution of human language and what distinguishes us from all other animals.<\/p> <p>Berwick and Chomsky discuss the biolinguistic perspective on language, which views language as a particular object of the biological world; the computational efficiency of language as a system of thought and understanding; the tension between Darwin's idea of gradual change and our contemporary understanding about evolutionary change and language; and evidence from nonhuman animals, in particular vocal learning in songbirds.<\/p> <p>Praise<\/p> <p>\"Explaining the origins of the unique is famously difficult. Through elegantly showing the simplicity of the underlying mechanism, Berwick and Chomsky adroitly surmount this problem in the case of that most remarkable of all human uniquenesses, our possession of language.\" \u2014Ian Tattersall, author of The Strange Case of the Rickety Cossack: And Other Cautionary Tales from Human Evolution<\/p> <p>\"Berwick and Chomsky, masters of language and computer science, make a daring proposition: the phenomenon 'human language' arose when the brain evolved to instantiate the simple operation 'Merge.' At this crucial moment the complex trait, which led to a new mode of evolution, fell into place. The book is captivating and a must for everyone interested in evolution and humans. It is a landmark that will define future research.\" \u2014Martin Nowak, Professor of Mathematics and Biology, Harvard University<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

His world becomes simpler, life becomes easier, things might just be looking up.<br\/>But nothing's ever that simple. Returning from a salvage run in the city, Edgar finds his family gone, taken to the south coast for evacuation by an international task force. \u00a0Suddenly he finds himself facing a gruelling journey on foot across a devastated United Kingdom. Accompanied by a group of misfits that include a large, hairy tattoo artist and an old man who claims to have run around Australia, Edgar must race against time and overcome his own short-comings, not to mention 100 mile canyons and a very strange council estate, to find the people he loves before he loses them forever. \"<\/p> <p>We meet at the Newton Public Library on the 3rd floor in the rear crescent.\u00a0 Plenty of free parking available.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check out our goodreads page at: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/161102-newton-library-scifi-book-club\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/161102-newton-library-scifi-book-club\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/161102-newton-library-scifi-book-club<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-scifi\/events\/224961488\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"April Newton Book Club","id":"224961488","time":1461627000000,"updated":1461631950000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1239728506000,"name":"The Boston Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1434288,"urlname":"boston-scifi","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"5 Longfellow Park","name":"Cambridge Friends Meeting House","lon":-71.127358,"id":918727,"state":"MA","lat":42.375848,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.13258886337,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1320695671000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(Please note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)<\/p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup<\/p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/230504329\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvgbhc","time":1461627000000,"updated":1461639364000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":2.58282089233,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459810320000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will gather at 46 Fisher Ave #1 (Boston) at 7:30pm, get settled and have a 20-30 minute sit; after a short break and discussion we will sit for another 20-30 minutes. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meditation instruction is given, and the meditation is guided to the extent that it is helpful to the group. \u00a0A $1-2 donation is recommended.<\/p> <p>On street parking is available on Fisher Ave. \u00a0The closest T-stop is Jackson Square on the Orange Line (8'). \u00a0The Heath Street stop on E-line is about a 13' walk.<\/p> <p>Please be prompt or contact me if running late.<\/p> <p>See you at meditation!<\/p> <p>bryan<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JP-MH-Meditation-Group\/events\/230468240\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Meditation Group","id":"gvnfslyvgbhc","time":1461627000000,"updated":1461639334000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1441916919000,"name":"JP \/ MH (Boston) Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18919060,"urlname":"JP-MH-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3300018311,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"44 Fifth Street","name":"Moves & Vibes Dance Studio","lon":-71.188751,"id":19335432,"state":"MA","lat":42.184925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5623426437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449460888000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>April 25th, Moves &amp; Vibes Dance Co starting a 8-week advance beginner Zouk beginners course.

While it may seem beyond what we formally think of as negotiation (contracts, clients), we are constantly negotiating, with our bosses, subordinates, peers, group members, customers, and clients. In order to succeed in our professional (and personal) lives, we need to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively with the people around us. To do so, we need key negotiation tools and communication skills to apply to the many, varied negotiations we engage in every day.<\/p> <p>This two-day workshop focuses on the nature of these interactions and helps participants gain insight into their own strengths and weaknesses as negotiators. Participants will learn the best ways to get what they want in a negotiation while strengthening (rather than damaging) their relationship with their negotiation counterpart. Using short lectures, role-plays, exercises and simulations, the workshop will provide a number of opportunities for participants to develop and test their skills.<\/p> <p>Beyond negotiation and influence theory, this course will teach participants how to incorporate the accompanying communication skills into their lives as new habits in a way that produces lasting changes in their behavior. We all learn to negotiate (advocate for our interests) at a very young age, leading each of us to have developed a set of negotiation skills and habits that we employ, often without giving it much thought. Without conscious attention to our negotiation style, we are limited to this narrow repertoire of familiar responses. And while these default responses may work well in some situations, they limit and handicap us in others. This course provides a model for shifting out of these default behaviors.<\/p> <p>All are welcome to attend the training and we are hoping to attract individuals and organizations pursuing missions of Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship.<\/p> <p>Our meetup will get 5% off the regular $264.74 price by using the Promo Code <b>Kathy<\/b>.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

A key to driving value from big data is getting analytics out of IT and spread throughout the organization. This shift to the spread of analytics throughout the organization and accompanying empowerment of individual users has led to the substantial increase in popularity in recent years of the R programming language. R is now the predominant tool used for computational statistics, data science and visualization. R is used extensively by the largest analytics driven companies in the world such as Google LinkedIn and Facebook.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session we will addresses the challenges of scaling R analytics at an enterprise level for big data and making scalable R analytics readily accessible to end users. We will explore the use of scalable, high performance platforms such as Spark; in-memory, columnar, massively parallel databases; and Hadoop to enable scalable R analytics. We will also explore cloud deployment patterns for enhanced agility and accessibility. In the session we will walk through examples and demos of R programs running on these scalable platforms.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1+Rogers+Street,+Cambridge,+MA,+us","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge\/events\/230518661\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Accelerating and Scaling R Analytics Using Spark R, In-memory Columnar Databases","id":"230518661","time":1461708000000,"updated":1461720523000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397574647000,"name":"Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":13926432,"urlname":"Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Bluemix-ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01752","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Marlborough","address_1":"72 Jefferson St","name":"72 Jefferson St","lon":-71.555717,"id":13699472,"state":"Ma","lat":42.350674,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.8592662811,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457120072000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/1\/d\/600_447485917.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Free.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229763701\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":10800000,"name":"LETTER and NUMBER TILE NIGHT","id":"229763701","time":1461708000000,"updated":1461792715000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"400 Highland Ave","name":"Five Horses Tavern","lon":-71.12085,"id":21358132,"lat":42.395676,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.58681702614,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459898763000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>No agenda, no speaker, and no pressure.

A key to driving value from big data is getting analytics out of IT and spread throughout the organization. This shift to the spread of analytics throughout the organization and accompanying empowerment of individual users has led to the substantial increase in popularity in recent years of the R programming language. R is now the predominant tool used for computational statistics, data science and visualization. R is used extensively by the largest analytics driven companies in the world such as Google LinkedIn and Facebook.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session we will addresses the challenges of scaling R analytics at an enterprise level for big data and making scalable R analytics readily accessible to end users. We will explore the use of scalable, high performance platforms such as Spark; in-memory, columnar, massively parallel databases; and Hadoop to enable scalable R analytics. We will also explore cloud deployment patterns for enhanced agility and accessibility.

Giamatti and Church, as well as actresses Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, playing local women who become romantically involved with the men, all received accolades for their performances.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/4\/7\/8\/event_208914392.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO BRING<\/b><\/p> <p>POT LUCK!

This event had the potential to be a major disaster, but you came together and kept it clean. Even better, you kept it fun and enjoyable! Therefore, we are going to run this event again!<br\/>For those of you who were not here last year, we are going to use the following rules. For those of you who were here please review said rules due to a few minor adjustments.<\/p> <p><b>1. One person can select one title. This is done by signing up for the event and then providing your title selection in the comments below. Once a title is selected, no one else may do so, so RSVP today!<\/p> <p>2. One of the issues that we have run into is the amount of material covered, so after selecting a title you may read and discuss up to two additional volumes of that title than we covered in the group.<\/p> <p>3. If you haven\u2019t liked any of the titles listed below, then pick the one you hated the most and be prepared to figuratively rip it apart!<\/p> <p>4. To prevent a possible blood bath, I am EXCLUDING the titles previously selected for this event last year, our light novel selection, as well as Naruto and Dragon Ball from the Anniversary Special. Let\u2019s try something new.<\/p> <p>5. As the coordinator of this group, I will select last, just to make things fair.<br\/><\/b><br\/>If you need copies of a title, the venue still has a whole bunch of them left over from earlier meetings.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s contemplative, and it\u2019s a great way to begin the process of discovering your own, personal \u201cWhat\u2019s Next?\u201d moment or path.<\/p> <p>Life Reimagined Check-up: This popular, engaging event is like a personalized guidance<br\/>system for life transitions.

Which explains why most of us avoid developing one. They're typically about 30 seconds, which approximates a typical attention span. Or does it?<\/p> <p>Finally, here's a reason to throw away your elevator pitch (if you even have one).<\/p> <p>Melanson believes they're too long, they provide description [vs position] against the competition, and it's not a strategy to continue thru the rest of the interaction. \u201cBranding books don\u2019t recognize that the most important branding moments are conversations,\u201d\u00a0 he explains.<\/p> <p>What's the answer?\u00a0 Great verbal branding is direct, honest, and moves action. We'll learn how to intrigue our listener instead of losing their attention. Ever have that sinking feeling of watching your words fly past him\/her?<\/p> <p>Stephen Melanson is an entertaining and dynamic speaker. We'll start working on our personal branding statements in the previous meetup (May 25), and refine and revise them with Melanson at the special June 8 session.\u00a0 The lessons you learn will stick with you for a long time to come.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ........................<\/b><\/p> <p>If you're new to Speak Up Cambridge, what should you expect from our usual meetups?<\/p> <p>Learn valuable do's and don'ts for addressing an audience.

It also is a time when we see people sometimes for the first time in months coming out of their bunkers. We'll see people playing with their kids in parks, or planting new gardens in their front yards (or along the bike path) etc... We might be doing things like this as well. The topic for this week, is given this influx of \"seeing\" others, what types of things can we do to be better neighbors. Most people admit that the concept of neighbor has kind of gone by the wayside. In fact, we join groups like Think and Drink as an opportunity to select in a way our neighbors (But we don't always know who'll be at meetup! Sometimes our actual neighbors!). But the people who live near us, could be great resources for us to find and build connections. A Harvard study, that hilariously took 75 years, showed that one key indicator to happiness is as we all already know - good relationships.

All are welcome to join us, regardless of experience level!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have a game you are particularly interested in playing, you are welcome and encouraged to bring it. But this is not required; many people typically bring a selection of their favorites and we're always happy to teach. The only things you need to bring are an open mind and a good attitude. If you're particularly hot to try something out, you are encouraged to leave a comment and see if you can drum up some interest beforehand. Please bear in mind that table space is limited, so an especially huge or epic game may not be appropriate for the venue (but see our Sunday night event at Pandemonium in Central Square for an alternative venue).<\/p> <p><br\/>The event officially opens at 7 PM, but some people like to show up early; those who show up early should feel free to get started on a shorter warm-up game if time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/>We look forward to seeing you at the gaming table!<\/p> <p><br\/>WHERE WE SIT: Unless the restaurant is super-crowded, we gather in the basement dining area; just look for the games and say hi. We're friendly, honest!<\/p> <p><br\/>GETTING THERE:<\/p> <p><br\/>The Panera is located within easy walking distance of the Red Line T and several bus lines, and public transit is probably the easiest way of getting there. If you drive, mall parking is (theoretically) limited to 2 hours except where posted. I've never heard of anyone getting towed for overstaying this limit. For the extra-cautious, there are metered spots on Mass Ave; check the meter to be sure but most Cambridge meters don't need to be fed after 6 PM or 7 PM. There is also a Hubway bike-share station less than five minute's walk from the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>SOME NOTES:<\/p> <p><br\/>As a group, we don't usually make a huge deal about attendance policy, however: attendance at these events is limited, and our Panera events are usually not huge; one side effect of this is that RSVPing and then not showing up can have a disruptive effect on our events, and for particularly popular events, \"no shows\" take up a spot from someone who wanted to be there. Bottom line: If you RSVP for a Panera event, please make a good-faith effort to show up or at least let us know if you can't make it.<\/p> <p><br\/>As far as possible, please also let us know if you're going to be more than a few minutes late. As a rule of thumb, if we haven't heard from you and you arrive after 7:15 or so, you're likely to be limited to a spot at whatever game has room for an extra player. Much later than that, and we'll almost certainly be underway without you! You're welcome to show up and socialize and of course we'll try to accomodate you if we can, but we can't guarantee you a game. Because we as a group tend to play longer and more involved games, most groups at our events tend to play one and only one game per night.<\/p> <p><br\/>Panera has been quite gracious about hosting our group with minimal fuss. To ensure that this happy state of affairs continues, please give them some business if you're hungry or thirsty and (especially) respect the hardworking people who work there, and their desire to go home after a long shift -- be ready to leave when the restaurant closes at ten.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/230240372\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Wednesday Gaming In Porter Square","id":"rgfbqlyvgbkc","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461809822000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692537784576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1304040222000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Seeking a successor to organize this Meetup.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily! You decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in many different styles. Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, dancers \u00a0hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together. \u00a0(This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better. \u00a0Welcome!

Since 2011, our mission has been to keep the rich musical tradition of choro alive in a contemporary US context. For the past several years we have hosted regular rodas (jam sessions) to provide a unique opportunity for enthusiasts of Choro to sit in with the band and hone their craft - these jams have been instrumental in building and maintaining a vibrant choro scene in New York. We have performed at venues such as Brasil Summer Fest, Zinc Bar, Barbes, Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, and the Brazilian Endowment for the Arts.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our first album, \"Na Roda\", is an attempt to capture the spirit of our regular rodas (jam sessions) -- all the playfulness, virtuosity, sensitivity, and joy that can come from performing live with close musical companions. The album features guest performances from several fantastic friends of ours -- the great Fred Hersch, Anat Cohen, and Eduardo Belo -- and is a window into the thriving Choro scene in New York.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rylesjazz.com\/week1.cfm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rylesjazz.com\/week1.cfm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rylesjazz.com\/week1.cfm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Venue - Ryles Jazz Club Parking and Directions Details<\/b><\/p> <p>If you can not find a meter, Ryles has a small parking lot on Hampshire Street between Armory and Prospect Streets, across from the Hess Express gas station\/adjacent to the 7-Eleven. \u00a0In addition, you may also park across the street at S&amp;S Restaurant, their sister restaurant.

Women come in to science later, leave earlier and express more discontent with their choices than their male counter parts. Why? A large part is the hold over culture from early days helps people avoid the burn out that all people experience in high end careers are more geared towards men. While this was not intentional, it is just that men were the entire crowd back then, women need ways to tackle the burn out factor that are specific to the way they live their lives. Planning the career track, working their way up the ladder and being a productive and valued team member are done differently between men and women. This talk focuses on how women can take steps in their journey to identify their specific areas of burn out, how to tackle them and how to move forward in the face of burn out.<\/p> <p>Learning Objectives<br\/>- Setting a career plan<br\/>- Using your mentoring network<br\/>- Identifying common \u201cburn out\u201d causes and what to do about them<br\/>- Working around, through and past difficult steps<br\/>- How to relax and have fun in your career<\/p> <p>About the Speaker<br\/>Heather S. Duffy, JD PhD is an internationally known cardiovascular researcher who began to develop trainee career development workshops as a way to enhance her student's career trajectories. The workshops were so successful, with her students winning top prizes in academic competitions, that she expanded the series to other groups. To date these workshops have been presented locally, nationally and even at international conferences. Dr. Duffy got her PhD in neuroscience from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY. She went on to her first independent faculty position at Columbia University College of Surgeons and Physicians where she worked on cardiac arrhythmias. After being recruited to Harvard Medical School Dr. Duffy became involved in the Harvard Leadership Program and was active in the development of workshops and curricula designed to maximize student and postdoctoral potential in the Cardiovascular Department. Additionally, as co-chair of the Early Career Committee for the Basic Cardiovascular Science council for the American Heart Association, Dr Duffy has helps hundreds of students and postdocs become better scientific professionals. In her latest adventure Dr. Duffy received her JD degree focusing on technology transfer, intellectual property protection and development of discovery for inventors interested in commercializing their discoveries.<\/p> <p>Dr. Duffy is the author of over 50 publications and is a renowned speaker both nationally and internationally with dozens of talks under her belt.

Tom Huntington shares his customer development journey as co-founder of Windshield.\u00a0 You\u2019ll hear about ways to collect data, ways to get inside customers\u2019 heads and ways to get out of your own.<\/p> <p>Customer development is a skill to be practiced.\u00a0 Following Tom\u2019s talk, we\u2019ll use a speed dating format to practice customer development interviewing.\u00a0 As a side
