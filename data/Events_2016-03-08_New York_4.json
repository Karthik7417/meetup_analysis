Entangled with unhappiness from the past, family members often continue patterns of anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, suicide, fear, chronic illness and unfulfilled relationships. It\u2019s a common theme: sad mother, sad daughter... alcoholic father, alcoholic son... the relationship difficulties of the parents, mirrored by the children.\nWe sometimes \u201ctake on\u201d destructive familial patterns as a way of \u201cbelonging\u201d in our families.<\/p> <p>Family Constellations allow us to break these patterns so that we can live healthier, happier, more fulfilled lives. In a moment of insight, a new life course can be set in motion. The results can be life-changing. \u2013 Bert Hellinger<\/p> <p>This will be an experimental meetup, during which time we will work with a family constellation or more depending on the time.

When we know how to navigate this unconscious territory, we can begin to shift long-standing patterns of suffering and unhappiness.<\/p> <p>During this event we will endeavor to identify the unconscious loyalties, unresolved traumas and hidden dynamics that contribute to patterns of illness, unhappiness and dissatisfaction, clear them, gain insight and deepen the healing process.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you feel like you could use healing of this nature and are also willing to help with another persons healing, please join me for this event.

Offering an elegant and stylish atmosphere.\u00a0 We will have a special section reserved for our group for socializing then great live music from Barry Bryson and the Stan Rubin Quartet.\u00a0 The Carnegie Club is also one of the select few clubs in NYC that you can still enjoy legal tobacco in.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>PREPAY ONLY EVENT (No tickets sold at the door) Purchase tickets here:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-scotch-and-live-jazz-tickets-21293570643\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-scotch-and-live-jazz-tickets-21293570643\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cigars-scotch-and-live-jazz-tickets-21293570643<\/a><\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>What to expect:<\/p> <p>-About a dozen members and friends casually gathering for cocktails and conversation.<\/p> <p>-Some will smoke cigars, (other legal tobaccos okay too) .

Purchase both at the same time and pay only $20 for the night!<\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Volunteers get in for\u00a0FREE!<br\/><\/b>Email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>\u00a0to inquire about volunteer opportunities.<\/p> <p>Stay informed:\u00a0<b><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/fGoUk\">join our mailing list<\/a>!<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/friday-night-blues-new-york-3\"><b>Friday Night Blues NYC is on Yelp!<\/b><\/a>\u00a0If you enjoy our event, please consider leaving us a review.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/www.fridaynightblues.nyc\/about\/locations","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Friday-Night-Blues-NYC\/events\/228512352\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":16200000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","id":"fnlmplyvdbzb","time":1455931800000,"updated":1455949425000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446516679000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19085086,"urlname":"Friday-Night-Blues-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"352 7th Ave","name":"Mustang Harry's","lon":-73.992996,"id":673167,"state":"NY","lat":40.748356,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.194220557809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454472304000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>**This is a weekenddating.com organized event.. prepay is required at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5986\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5986<\/a>**<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Date &amp; Time:\u00a0<\/b><b>Friday, February 19, 2016<br\/>8:30 PM-10:00 PM<\/p> <p>Male ages: 27-43<br\/>Female ages: 25-41<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0Mustang Harrys (by Penn Station)<br\/>352 7th Avenue<br\/>New York, NY 10036<\/p> <p>Cost:\u00a0$35.75<\/p> <p>Description:\u00a0Speed Dating- Up to 15 dates in one night!

They input data from temperature, proximity, acceleration and hundreds of other types of sensors, and output to LEDs, motors, sound devices, LCD displays, and much more. Arduino is an open source platform supported by a large community of people sharing their knowledge and most importantly Arduino is very easy to use.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/4\/c\/600_446736172.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIn this Introduction to Arduino class you will learn how to install the free Arduino Development Environment software onto your Mac or Windows laptop and hookup an Arduino to your laptop's USB port to program it. A very basic understanding of programming is recommended, but it does not matter which language. This course will be taught with two different Arduinos. For most people, we recommend the Arduino UNO that is general purpose and has a lot of memory and expansion capabilities. For students who wish to learn Arduino for wearable electronics, we recommend the Adafruit Flora which is optimized to be sewn into clothing with conductive thread and be powered by a battery. The software and principles to use these two devices are much the same.<\/p> <p>The class will cover an introduction to Arduino programming, basic electrical circuits, how circuits are documented with electronic schematics, and a program called Fritzing. We will control some LEDs, and input some sensor data. This class will be using solderless breadboards to hookup components; there will be no soldering involved.<\/p> <p>The instructor of this class will be Stewart Newfeld who has an Electrical Engineering degree from Rutger University, years of industrial experience, and loves to teach and share his enthusiasm for making things.<\/p> <p><b>IMPORTANT: Students must bring their Mac or Windows laptop to class. No laptops will be provided.<\/b><\/p> <p>MATERIALS CHARGES: Students may bring their own Arduinos and breadboards, or they can purchase the following on-site right before class.<\/p> <p><br\/>Arduino Device $20.00 + Tax<br\/>Every student must either bring their own Arduino UNO or Adafruit Flora, or purchase one of these for $20 + tax.<\/p> <p>Hardware Starter Kit $18.00 + Tax<br\/>Unless they bring something similar, every student must purchase a hardware starter kit consisting of<\/p> <p>- solderless breadboard<br\/>- jumper wire assortment<br\/>- resistor assortment<br\/>- capacitor assortment<br\/>- diodes<br\/>- servo motor<br\/>- push buttons<br\/>- potentiometer<br\/>- LED assortment<br\/>- NEO Pixel LEDs<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/228685619\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":16200000,"name":"Introduction to Arduino Class","id":"228685619","time":1455980400000,"updated":1455998216000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364936758000,"name":"fat cat FAB LAB","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":7890972,"urlname":"fat-cat-fab-lab","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"397 FDR Drive New York, NY 10002","name":"Corlears Hook Park","lon":-73.979286,"id":24090437,"state":"NY","lat":40.7118,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":2.70386266708,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1454691305000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>THE GAME: Informal Meet Up 7vs7\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This game is\u00a0ideally for <b>INTERMEDIATE to ADVANCED<\/b> players,<b>NOT for BEGINNERS<\/b>.\u00a0Please bring\u00a0GOOD ATTITUDE. \u00a0<\/p> <p>RSVP GUIDELINES:\u00a0IMPORTANT: \u00a0You must be on the RSVP list to play.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

The term Interspirituality means that each one of us can find the fulfillment of their life in communion with their Soul. We gather in faith that the Divine answers individual call in many unique ways. Each one can find Truth and Divinity, foraging for their spiritual food - just like in the Neolithic era, before the religions acquired their square walls - looking into many traditions, scriptures, sages and teachers\u2026<\/p> <p>We'll be celebrating our one year anniversary on SATURDAY, February 20th and you are invited! The program is open to a free flow of guests throughout the day. You may want to choose the events however you like.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

From the museum's description:<\/p> <p><i>The magnificent sculpture of the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) has long been considered a high point in the history of Japanese art.

The Museum maintains a collection of over 24,000 works, and retains an artist archive that contains information on over 1,900 LGBTQ artists, both those represented in the collection and others of interest to LGBTQ audiences.<\/p> <p>Admission to the museum is FREE. If we can guarantee a group of at least 10, we may ask the museum to provide a tour guide.<\/p> <p>Mass transit: Each person is responsible for getting to the museum, but if you live near NJ Transit's Morris and Essex line a group will be getting on the train that departs Dover at 12:05 PM (Morristown @12:23 PM, Madison @12:31 PM, Orange @1:04 PM) arriving at NY Penn Station at 1:39 PM. Check NJTransit.com for fares. From NY Penn Station, we will take the A Train to Canal St, then walk 2-3 short blocks to the museum.<\/p> <p>Hoofing it? Sherri Rase would like to help organize a group who would prefer to get a hearty walk in before arriving at the museum. Sherri is planning to walk the entire length of the High Line park, starting at 1:00 PM, then meander through Greenwich Village to the museum. Total walk is approximately 2 miles. Contact Sherri at [masked] if you'd like to join her.<\/p> <p>Dinner plans: For each outing, there is usually a meal planned either before or after. This time, after the museum closes, or when the group decides, we will walk back to the \"Canal St.\" subway stop which is actually located at 35 6th Avenue, and pop into the AOA Bar and Grill, roughly 20 feet from the \"Canal St.\" subway entrance. They offer a small but diverse menu of salads, sides, soups, personal pizzas, sandwiches and complete dinners. Check out the menu at www.AOABarandGrillNYC.com.<\/p> <p>Primary organizer for this GAAMC Outing is Nick from the 20-Somethings.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting

primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to

Light of Iris is a Shamanic healing ceremony that uses meditation, journaling, dance, drawing, music, and .... more to help facilitate lasting emotional healing and a permanent expansion of consciousness. For some that means increased creativity, for others that can mean healing deeply repressed childhood wounds in a matter of hours, for some it can mean reawakening a connection to ones ancestors and their power. It is named after my late Great Grandmother Iris Palmer who came to me in a vision as pure light during a previous ceremony. I don't have the right words to describe the impact that had on me, but we do want to share that possibility with others. This is about remembering who you are and standing in that power.

You may use this guide, oriented in opposite direction, for this hike.<\/p> <p><br\/>56.20 Hudson River Waterfront Walkway enters area of Hoboken Station. Metrotrails has not scouted this entire newer section yet. More detail needed.<br\/>The pathway skirts the light rail station terminus, then makes it's way around and through Hoboken Station.<br\/>56.50 Reach road on the other side, Hudson Place at the old Lackawanna Railroad terminal.<br\/>Continue north through Erie Lackawanna Park. Reach waterfront and turn left, then right passing Sam Sloan statue parallel with Sinatra Drive. Post office is on the left. Turn right out onto another pier area and skirt it's outside.

Stevens Park is across the street to the left.<br\/>57.25 The pathway enters an open amphitheater and enters Sinatra Park. Continue along the water. The pathway is supposed to go around Sinatra Park, but may be redeveloped due to storm damage or improvment\/repair. Continue around the ball field area and return to the road. It may be necessary to continue north on Frank Sinatra Drive.<br\/>57.60 Frank Sinatra Drive and the HRW Walkway are right next to each other along the water.<br\/>57.70 A dock extends to the right of the trail. To the left of here is Sybil's Cave, in the past and once again a tourist attraction along the Palisade Cliffs. It is also in this area that the Palisades become more pronounced. The formation, made of igneus intrusive basalt, extends from NY west of High Tor south into NJ and Bayonne, where it is known as Bergen Hill.<br\/>Just ahead, a piece of the walkway extends and stops parallel with the Castle Point Skate Park. It is necessary to turn onto Frank Sinatra Drive and head north along the road here. The area to the right of the road is actively used industrially.<br\/>57.92 Turn right on Sinatra Drive North briefly, across from the lawn at Maxwell Place, then immediaetely right on the walkway. The walkway will skirt the perimeter of Maxwell Place Park.<br\/>58.20 The walkway nears to Sinatra Drive North again. There is a new public pier off to the right.<br\/>Continue north with Hoboken Ship Yard to the right.<br\/>58.30 Ship Yard Dog Run is on the right.<br\/>58.40 Hoboken 14th Street Pier, now a public park, is on the right with fantastic views at the end.<br\/>Continue north.<br\/>58.46 Abandoned pier on the right. The pathway turns to the left.<br\/>58.51 Bernard McFeely Shipyard Lane. Turn right here on the sidewalk, then at 58.55 turn right again along the walkway beside a building.<br\/>58.60 Turn left, heading west along the walkway<br\/>58.76 Harborside Park is on the left. The walkway turns right, heading north once again along the Hudson.<br\/>58.82 Square overlook area to the right. The pathway once again turns left heading inland a bit, then right to the north.<br\/>58.92 Walkway turns right<br\/>58.97 Now out on the water, the walkway turns left again, north.<br\/>59.03 Path intersection. A little park extends to the right along Harbor Blvd. The walkway turns right.<br\/>59.10 Large parking area to the right. Continue along the waterfront, east at first, then north.<br\/>59.28 Lincoln Harbor and ferry along the right of the walkway. Continue north. Giant condos extend out onto the water to the right.<br\/>59.33 Just beyond the condos, giant boat area in Lincoln Harbor is passed on the right.<br\/>59.50 Parking lot pier to the right. Continue north. Harbor Blvd turns off to the left.<br\/>59.63 Turn left heading west again. Head all the way out to Port Imperial Blvd.<br\/>59.72 Turn right on Port Imperial Blvd sidewalk.<br\/>59.78 Turn right into Weehawken Waterfront Park and Recreation Center. Keep to the sidewalk on the right hand side of the lot.<br\/>59.85 Reach a paved pathway that turns right away from the sidewalk and follow it. Keep to the right.<br\/>59.93 Back along the Hudson River, continue north on the walkway within the park.<br\/>60.15 The walkway leaves Weehawken Waterfront Park. Continue ahead remaining on the waterfront. Trail parallels Henley Place.<br\/>60.27 Reach the intersection with Cambridge Way off to the left. It was just up hill, within view, beyond this point where Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton had their famous duel that mortally wounded Hamilton.<br\/>60.37 The pathway turns left again, then soon turns right continuing north with apartment buildings off to the left.<br\/>60.50 Access path between buildings comes in from left.<br\/>60.56 The walkway turns hard to the right and then left.<br\/>60.60 Reach Carlyl Court. The pathway crosses here, then diagonally crosses Pershing Park before resuming along the Hudson. Boats docked to the right.<br\/>60.78 Pass a memorial that look like standing tuning forks. The pathway zig zags back and forth on the waterfront as it has.<br\/>61.16 Pass Port Imperial ferry terminal on the right. Continue along the Hudson.<br\/>61.25 The walkway turns ninety degrees to the right<br\/>61.31 The walkway turns ninety degrees to the left with parking area to left.<br\/>61.42 Access path between apartment buildings to left.<br\/>61.57 Abandoned pier to the right<br\/>61.63 Walkway turns ninety degrees right<br\/>61.68 Walways turns ninety degrees left at Riverwalk Place with circular patterned walkway to the left next to buildings.<br\/>61.83 Walway turns ninety degrees to the right, then to the left again. In the area ahead, there is an old pier stuck to the right. This was not here when we first scouted it, so it must have broken off of another location and floated here during a storm.<br\/>62.06 An abandoned wooden pier is off to the right, closed to public (I managed to get out to the end of it years ago, before it was in such a bad state of repair).<br\/>62.14 Small abandoned pier to right.<br\/>62.25 The walkway crosses a bridge over a basin. Continue north.<br\/>62.33 Cross another bridge over a basin.<br\/>62.48 The walkway turns ninety degrees left in a section with shrubs planted in it.<br\/>62.58 Reach River Road and turn right on the sidewalk.<br\/>62.67 Turn right back along the HRWF Walkway.<br\/>62.75 Side path to the right and viewing area.

Continue past a building.<br\/>63.21 Turn left to Marine Road, then right immediately onto the walkway north.<br\/>63.31 The walkway extends along the water ahead, but soon dead ends. Check it out, but then return to here, to a paved path that departs to the left. Follow it to Riverview Circle, then continue straight toward Roc Harbour Drive.<br\/>63.38 Reach Roc Harbour Drive. Cross, and follow a path on the other side which will lead to the waterfront walkway. Turn left when you reach it.<br\/>63.50 Turn left on the walkway heading west.<br\/>63.63 Reach River Road. Turn right on the sidewalk heading north.<br\/>63.77 Traffic light at Bulls Ferry Road. Continue north on River Road.<br\/>63.67 Some sort of industrial entrance to the right. Continue on River Rd.<br\/>64.00 Diner on the right. Ahead is a four way traffic light at Old River Road. Continue straight on River Road heading north.<br\/>64.22 Traffic light at Gorge Road, River Rd and City Place. Continue to the right from the light heading east into a parking lot.<br\/>64.30 Reach a parking lot. Continue diagonally across it to the southeast side.<br\/>64.40 Resume the waterfront walkway<br\/>64.58 Cross an entrance lane with a circle to the left from a pier. Continue on the walkway as it turns left, then right back to the waterfront.<br\/>64.70 Water on the right, large parking lot and Edgewater Multiplex Cinima movie theater on the left.<br\/>64.77 A path to the left leads back to River Road. Continue right, then left along the waterfront.<br\/>64.87 Pass cul de sac of Independence Way on the left.

The walkway parallels Harbor View Terrace and continues.<br\/>65.34 Two old piers to the right&gt;<br\/>65.40 Pass a retention pond on the left<br\/>65.51 A pier to the right leads to a crab restaurant. Continue ahead along the Hudson.<br\/>65.59 A pathway to the left leads back to River Road. Continue ahead with the high nets of the Edgewater Driving Range skirting the side of the pathway.<br\/>65.70 Depart from the driving range border and continue north past buildings.<br\/>65.80 Reach Archer Street and turn left back toward River Road as the walkway has ended again.<br\/>65.92 Turn right on River Road north on the sidewalks<br\/>66.10 Turn right into a strip mall area to the right. Follow the store fronts.Remain on the right heading around the building until the Hudson waterfront is regained.<br\/>66.25 Reach more waterfront walkway and turn left.<br\/>66.30 The pathway leaves the retail area. Soon, it skirts high end condos and apartment areas on the left. NOTE: This section was not completed or open when scouted by Metrotrails. More info needed.<br\/>66.58 Trail seems to pass through a building<br\/>66.63 Access path to the left and skirt a large parking lot on the left. This is a Whole Foods Market. Continue along the waterfront.<br\/>66.90 After passing more condos, turn ninety degrees left once more, then soon another ninety right.<br\/>66.98 Grand Cove Marina and Edgewater Ferry Landing is on the right. The walkway ends here. Continue out to River Road.<br\/>67.08 Continue north on River Road<br\/>NOTE: There is a park that used to have loop trails, but is now undeveloped and inaccessible. We assume this will be re-opened, and include it in mileage as if it were not an issue. In the meantime, hikers should remain on River Road and avoid this section until mile 67.96.<br\/>67.96 The pathway meets River Road again. Turn right and follow River Road.<br\/>68.48 Turn right onto Annett Ave, Fort Lee<br\/>68.58 Turn left on Colony Road.<br\/>68.82 Intersection with Henry Hudson Drive.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/269509_10150241103181777_3720283_n.jpg?oh=96e9fcd55b0d0a5202aa4b6692cc4492&amp;oe=5719D164\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/269509_10150241103181777_3720283_n.jpg?oh=96e9fcd55b0d0a5202aa4b6692cc4492&amp;oe=5719D164<\/a><\/p> <p>Anyone can cut out early at any time they like to do abbreviated versions of this hike.

Let\u2019s have some fun this Sun., and go hiking within NYC as we go hiking in the Staten Island green belt.

We are out to have a fun time, so if you want to run or stroll this is the wrong trip. We might even see deer. There are buses from the SI ferry that go right to the nature center (s62 and S61 to Bradley and transfer for the S57). Take the 9:30 S.I. ferry to S. I., and then take either the S-61 or S-62 bus to Bradley. At Bradley take the s-57 to the nature center. The plan is to meet at the nature center at 11:00 AM. We will start on Blue trail the Red trail, and then take the yellow trail to Moses Mountain, and to it ends at Willow Swamp. We then go back to the nature center. Bring lunch, water, and hiking boots. After the hike we may go out for food and drinks.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

These two beauties were amazing together at our last shoot back in July and it's time for Round 2!<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned and a possible 4th with both models if there is time. First, we will shoot a bikini look as I know we're all looking forward to some swimwear shoots this summer. Second, we will have a lingerie look, Victoria Secret style. Last look will be an implied look.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. We have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. So, please\u00a0only\u00a0sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit to hold your spot. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is\u00a0not\u00a0held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. All deposits need to be received immediately upon signup or within 5 days of the shoot or we will have to fill the unconfirmed spot\/s ASAP or cancel the shoot (existing deposits returned) if the minimum RSVP is not met. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox on the PayPal page as that adds the surcharge automatically.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/228786438\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":10800000,"name":"Bikini, Lingerie & Implied Shoot w\/Neesy & Marisol - Feb. 21","id":"228786438","time":1456074000000,"updated":1456086134000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Montclair ","address_1":"James St","name":"Fiona's Kitchen, Montclair, NJ","lon":-74.216545,"id":24342027,"lat":40.822838,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.9019241333,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452830787000,"fee":{"amount":75,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Ayurveda w\/ Fiona Andrews (4-Hr CE with YA ) Sunshine Yoga Life welcomes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fionalandrews.com\">Fiona Andrews<\/a> back for the second <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunshineyogalife.com\/get-certified.html\">RYT-200 Training program<\/a>.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of scene work (role playing). You'll be on your feet quite a bit as I'm believer that you learn (and have more fun) through doing rather than hearing an instructor talk. Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This class is $10. \u00a0If money is an issue for you, let me know and we can work something out. \u00a0The cost goes to pay for the cost of the room rental, Meetup fees, and website. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><br\/>Steve<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.improvnow.com\">www.improvnow.com<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/improvnow\">www.facebook.com\/improvnow<\/a><\/p> <p>Steve Ling is an alumnus of the improv programs of the Upright Citizens Brigade, Peoples Improv Theater, Magnet Theater, &amp; Annoyance Theater.

It's easy to get there via mass transit (Path train from Manhattan), to the Journal Square station. It's a quick walk from there to Mana. If you have a vehicle, there's free parking in the Mana lot. There's info below for the Mana shuttle bus, which departs from West 15th Street. Many of us will meet at the 14th Street (&amp; Sixth Ave) Path station, and ride out together.<\/p> <p>\n\nMana is a huge place. We all may get separated while touring the various floors &amp; galleries. I'll set a time for us all to reassemble, and we can then go to an Indian restaurant in the area. The \"Little India\" neighborhood of Jersey City is right nearby, and it's fun and very reasonable.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe weather will be perfect, as it always is for us.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Rather than blame the elite, we need to see how they gained so much control. They did not do it with just brute force. They have succeeded by both deceiving and undercutting our intelligence, and they have been doing this for a long long time. To wake up, we have to stop craving another information fix and start applying new choices. We might check if material \u201cprogress\u201d and ecologic balance are at odds. If our timeline looks dysfunctional we need to change our values and make health for all life our new goal. This is empowering. Empowerment means we work locally as diverse communities, not under the nefarious leadership of the World Bank or United Nations.<\/p> <p>I will be weaving history, celebrities, the Earth, and religion to show how we have been made into sheeple and distracted. Disimpowerment and distraction is what our young people now consider normal. How will we reverse this?<\/p> <p><b>Bio <\/b>- Ray Songtree is an author on the subject of cultural rejuvenation through deprogramming. He has a degree in Conservation of Natural Resources. Ray worked as a carpenter in Washington State and Hawaii and has reconnected with indigenous cultures in Arizona, the Pacific, Tibet, Australia and Bolivia. His first awakening occurred in Bodh Gaya, India in 1974. Of the many spiritual elders he met, Kobun Chino Roshi, also the sensei of Steve Jobs, was the most important. Ray is 63.<\/p> <p>\u201cAbout ten years ago I became aware that the media was lying to me about almost everything, such as Martin Luther King, 9\/11, global warming and autism. This started a new adventure in unraveling what the hell is going on. I was pissed. I discovered there is a documented organization with a global plan, a methodology and an anti-virtue underpinning. I discovered that the secrecy of our puppet leaders is built on shame for behavior that they themselves are tricked into. If talented people are trusted with secrets, they succeed. If they are not trusted, they are defunded, smeared, sabotaged, or worse. Celebrities, business persons and scientists are made famous by the machine that controls publicity.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cI focus on what has been lost because of colonization which now includes digital artificial intelligence. Our schools now transform kids to become intellectually deficient and below the waist. I discuss how depopulation programs are becoming unglued as people choose organic and non-GM foods. We are very close to a turning point. Cancerous wireless frequencies will be exposed soon.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cI am not interested in belief systems or theories. I share evidence based coordinates.

The dwellings' most distinguishing feature is that the roof of a house is the courtyard of the upper neighbor. Layer upon layer, the roofs extend to the peak of a mountain, and some are even as high as seventeen floors. It looks like a long ladder as well as a honeycomb. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Chengzi+Ancient+Village&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9UeFUuncOoXMsQSwuoK4Bw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=600\">Google Image Search<\/a> .<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/d\/2\/600_382849362.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/c\/c\/600_382849612.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Following are images from our 2014 China trip:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/f\/c\/600_382850172.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/2\/8\/600_382850472.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>After a late afternoon shoot, we drive back to nearest town Luxi for the night: LuXi FuDing Hotel.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Day 6: Feb. 26th<\/b><\/p> <p><b>After breakfast in our hotel, we will go back to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.kunming.cn\/index\/content\/2012-03\/14\/content_2874929.htm\">Chengzi Ancient Village<\/a> to shoot under soft morning light.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We will then drive to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Luoping_County\">Luoping<\/a> to photograph the fields of canola (also known as rapeseed) in full bloom.

The farms here are on a smaller scale. They are carved out of a shallow valley with gentle slopes. These farms do not look any different or attractive as one passes them by on ground level. However, as soon as one gets higher up, following the road, the scenery changes. The flowers are grown in circular rings following the contours of the slopes. As a result, from higher ground, these farms looks like the rings of a snail\u2019s shell, akin to rice terraces in corkscrew patterns. It is rather amazing when one considers that the farms were created by the farmers as a response to the natural limitations of the land. Yet they are like a work of art, with an artist exquisitely drawing circular rings on the ground and then filling them up with splashes of shocking yellow.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/8\/e\/600_382851342.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\"Snail farms\" fields of Canola<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Overnight in Zhongyuan Hotel In Luoping<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Day 7: Feb. 27th<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Early morning shoot in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.olegnovikov.com\/cptg\/yunnan\/luoping.shtml\">Jinjiling<\/a>(\u91d1 \u9e21\u5cad, also known as Jinjifeng; Golden Rooster Hill), which is the classic spot for photographing rapeseed flowers of Luoping.

About 70 lakes of different sizes link together to form a 12.4 mile long tourist watercourse. 300 distinct peaks tower over crystal waters; some seem like elegant pagodas while others resemble penholders. Among the peaks there are more than 200 karst caves, of which about 80 large ones can be visited. In the deep, quiet caves, milky stalagmites grow thickly and steles stand in great numbers. Outside, the vast waters are dotted in summer with shining lotus flowers and boundless lotus leaves, enhancing the picturesque scenery.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Tourists can take a traditional canoe made by the Yi people to admire the stunning spectacle. Simple cottages in good condition, surrounded with cut bamboo, are situated by the lakes.

They have also created an integrated farming system that involves buffalos, cattle, ducks, fish and eel and supports the production of red rice, the area\u2019s primary crop. The inhabitants worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, forests and other natural phenomena including fire. They live in 82 villages situated between the mountaintop forests and the terraces.

It is a means of cooperation and alignment with hierarchical intent. The new moon period follows upon the cycle of outbreathing in the rhythmic cycles of the breath; it is a time of pause wherein together we can establish a soul-mind-brain alignment.\u00a0 During this period we work in thought to concretize the ideas and impressions received at the time of the full moon period and undertake the sometimes difficult process of translating them into practical plans that can be of service in the world. The effect of this meditative effort is to enhance the many ways in which the \u201cpower of the one Life\u201d and the \u201clove of the one soul\u201d are working out through all true servers everywhere.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I LEAVE THE FATHER'S HOME AND TURNING BACK, I SAVE.\"<\/p> <p>The keynote for the\u00a0aspirant in #Pisces is a particularly useful seed thought for meditation. It carries within it the whole process of involution and evolution; the going forth of the unit of life into a material state of consciousness so dense that for long ages the innate divinity of the soul in incarnation is lost to sight. Gradually, through the process of experience in matter, the life aspect begins to re-assert its presence, eventually exerting such a pull on the consciousness of the personality that the decision is made to tread the \"path of return,\" to \"turn back\" towards the source and the origin of Being. It is the story of the prodigal son within each member of the human family.<\/p> <p>The keynote also carries the note of redemption. The act of conscious return to the \"father's home\" serves to refine and redeem material substance.
