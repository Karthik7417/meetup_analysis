Patrons who come to stay can buy what they use in their rooms, buy something like it in the gallery, or take a class and learn how to make it. The community art hotel will serve as the center of our creative community while also acting as an incubator to support artists as small businesses.

(BBS) Do you beatbox? Do you want to learn? Do you want to improve your skills, or meet other beatboxers to collaborate? Are you a singer or rapper looking for a beatboxer to back your vocals? This group aims to recognize beatboxing (aka vocal percussion) as an art form and musical style. At BBS, we'll be hosting beatboxing technique workshops (learn a new sound to add to your repertoire!), beatbox jam sessions, beatbox open mics and performances, beatbox competitions, and technology workshops (loopers, recording techniques, etc.). Events will take place at various places around Boston with superb echo and reverb! (Think Kenmore station staircase, under bridges, etc.). Brendon Albertson (Green Beatbox) created this group out of a passion to give beatboxing the respect it deserves, just as any other style of music or instrument. A large network of beatboxers exists online, but to this day European countries are far ahead of the U.S. in creating an in-person beatboxing scene.

Here's a chance to do so by listening to it and talking about it with both enthusiasts and the musicians who create it. - Do you love to play Jazz? Unlike other sessions and jams, here's a chance to do so, and to engage with those who come to listen in-between sets. - Are you a Jazz Enthusiast? Want to share your knowledge (\"who played cornet on Jacque St. Clair's recording of 'Vital Stats'?\") with musicians - or even with newbies who've yet to explore the world of Jazz that you love? If any of these describe you, then this MeetUp is for you. Forged from Delta Blues, infused with African and Latin rhythms, and using American energy and ingenuity to push the limits of harmonic and melodic boundaries, Jazz can bring together peoples of a wide variety of backgrounds, regardless of class, ethnicity or education.

Dancing provides balance from what ever busy-ness or non-activity you\u2019ve been engaged in. Dancing your heart out allows you to process and integrate the challenges you've needed to face.

Each class is designed to bring you into the most powerful, loving and inspired connection to yourself. As a ritual practice over time, your self expression becomes freer, more confident, more varied. Your sense of who you are and what you can accomplish expands. You may enter into a state of BLISS.

A labyrinth offers only one path into the center, and the same path back out. Although there are turns to negotiate, there are no blind alleys, dead ends, or tricks - as in a maze. In fact, quite the opposite - the ancient design of a labyrinth was created for the powerful purpose of allowing you to completely trust the path you are on, to let your mind simply rest, that your spirit might find its way to your inner center along the path.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of labyrinths in all kinds of media (stones, earth, portable painted canvases), has had a great resurgence in recent years. There are many labyrinths in this area. <b>I would love for this group site to become a channel for folks to plan walks, connect and explore labyrinths all around.<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I also encourage this space to be a community center of information for sharing and learning about labyrinths and the practice of labyrinth walking together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this is of interest to you, please join us. I look forward to walking with you!<\/p>\n<p>To begin, I want to invite you to a regular monthly Full Moon Labyrinth Walk that I host at the Somerville Growing Center (just outside of Union Square in Somerville). I offer this outdoor labyrinth walk gathering each month on the Sunday nearest the full moon - May through October. Please look for more details listed on our meetup site. Welcome, and feel free to message if you have questions and\/or ideas!<\/p>\n<p>[a quote from <i>The Way of the Labyrinth<\/i> by Helen Curry: <i>\u201cPeople come to labyrinths for a multitude of reasons, but most find that walking a labyrinth can be a transformative experience. As people tread through the turns and counterturns, the world begins to drop away. Walking, breathing, being - things that we never think about in the day-to-day whirl of life - become conscious and deliberate. The spiritual and physical merge into a walking meditation. Our pace becomes a background rhythm against which we are able to clear our minds.\u201d<\/i>]<\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/highres_443276901.jpeg","photo_id":443276901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/600_443276901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/thumb_443276901.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8514806,"name":"Katrina ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/highres_246462850.jpeg","photo_id":246462850,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/member_246462850.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/thumb_246462850.jpeg"}},"members":213,"name":"Labyrinth Walking","id":18621831,"state":"MA","urlname":"Labyrinth-Walking","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Labyrinth Walkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432606198000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"dads","name":"Dads","id":468},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"sahd","name":"Stay-at-Home Dads","id":2140},{"urlkey":"sahp","name":"Stay at Home Parents","id":10060},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"moms-and-dads-group","name":"Moms and Dads Group","id":29314},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Downtown-Boston-Parents\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Got a baby?

They take hold like parasites in our brains, and make us do things\u2014even while we are doing them\u2014that we don\u2019t want to be doing, that make us feel out of control, and which injure us. Sound familiar? <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Meetup is for people who know what I am talking about. Who may have gained weight as a result of having these cravings. Who may have lost opportunities in their lives\u2014romantic, social, business\u2014because of weight gain and being overweight. These cravings\u2014and all the problems associated with them\u2014can be eliminated. Ask me. I went through what I\u2019m describing many years ago, gaining weight, eating a pound of chocolate a day, and feeling gross and disgusting. I was overweight as a kid, and\u2014long story short\u2014developed an alcohol problem as a young adult. Managed to sober up at age 33, but my addiction switched to food, and eventually\u2014another long story made short\u2014discovered a solution. A solution that I\u2019ve improved on, and use to this day. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I decided to share it with the world. You don\u2019t have to live with the pain of being overweight. Of dealing with \u201cweight creep\u201d, as it inches upward. Of the stress of feeling your clothing getting tighter and tighter. Of constantly berating, belittling and beating yourself up for being unable to deal with this. Of knowing things won\u2019t get better the way you are going now. There is a solution for you. That\u2019s what this Meetup is for. To give you the first steps toward regaining control over your eating, and your life. To help you not only lose weight, but more importantly, keep it off. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not only will the Meetup be free, but for attending you will get a report entitled \u201cWhat the Diet Experts and Gurus Don\u2019t Know\u201d. Plus you will get actionable steps as to what to do next. <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a whole foods, plant based approach--but don't worry!&nbsp; There is no political agenda, this is only an approach to health and weight loss and management.&nbsp; No one is going to insist you stop eating meat, unless you choose.&nbsp; There are SO many benefits of doing so, that you may decide for yourself that it is a direction you want to go.&nbsp; Even if you don't know how to cook, give it a try--do you have anything to lose, except some weight?<br><\/p>","lon":-71.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/highres_439158693.jpeg","photo_id":439158693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/600_439158693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/0\/5\/thumb_439158693.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2209370,"name":"Al D.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/e\/1\/highres_246277345.jpeg","photo_id":246277345,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/e\/1\/member_246277345.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/e\/1\/thumb_246277345.jpeg"}},"members":92,"name":"Curb Those Cravings!

This community provides a chance to explore, learn, and grow in a safe, welcoming, and consensual environment. We require applicants to fill out an application, which is reviewed by real live people, so please answer the questions thoroughly and thoughtfully. We actually read your answers carefully and may decline applications based on inadequate answers. <b>Your answers will be visible <\/b>only <b>to members of the group<\/b>. <b>Couples <\/b>must complete <b>separate profiles<\/b> and applications.; they may reference each other if they wish.

We like to play together because we trust each other.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that sexual energy can be a powerful tool for transformation, healing, solidifying relationships, and building community, and we develop that energy in fun events that are generally free or carry a small cost to cover expenses.<\/p>\n<p><b>Education, workshops, parties, classes, and outings<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Touch: As we understand the importance of touch in our lives, we create events that focus on touch, such as massage events and cuddles. Sensation: The senses are the gateway to the brain, so we plan sensual feasts, naked yoga, dance parties, nature-oriented outings, concerts, and theater. Sexuality: Members plan events centered around understanding and exploring all aspects of human sexuality, relationship styles, kink, gender and orientation. SPNE welcomes heteros, gays, trans, bi's, monos, polys, those questioning, and lovers of every age.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is Sex Positivity?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sex positivity is a social movement and philosophy which regards all consensual expressions of sexuality as healthy, encourages sexual pleasure and experimentation, places an emphasis on informed consent and advocates sex education and risk-aware sex. Sex-positivity makes no moral distinctions among types of sexual expression, orientation or identification, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.<\/p>\n<p><b>What does our group do?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We are a community of like-minded people, and a non-profit education and advocacy group. Using Meetup as a platform we sponsor events that promote the forming of a strong and well informed community of sex-positive people who support each other in their endeavors to lead richer, fuller, sexier, lives. Our mission is to improve the world by embracing the tenets of the Sex-Positive Movement. Most of our events fall into either the social, or workshop categories; others include festivals, fundraisers and field trips. We place a strong emphasis on community building.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is an Orientation?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>After you have joined the group you can attend any level 1 event that interests you. In order to become fully active in the group we require you to attend an Orientation. This full-evening of activity introduces our ideas and mission, explains how our group and events work, and includes some fun interactive games. These occur on the first Sunday of every month, and in the middle of the month. After orientation, if you are invited into the group, you may attend other events.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Events<\/b><\/p>\n<p>SexPositive events are coded Level 1 through Level 3<\/p>\n<p><b>Level One:<\/b> &nbsp;Friendly, flirtatious, and playful, light touch such as hand to hand, or hand to face, \"friendly style\" rather than \"sensual\" or \"sexual\". Activities might include workshops, classes, meet and greets, book clubs, eating, or dancing.<\/p>\n<p><b>Level Two:<\/b>&nbsp;Sensual, increasingly flirtatious, but not sexual. Activities might include workshops or classes with nudity or live demonstrations, light touching, sexy dancing, massage, or kissing. Topless disrobing may occur at some events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>Level Three:<\/b>&nbsp;<\/span><span>More overtly sexual.

Once I see where everyone is from who joins I will try to make meetups in a central location or if it's further away give more notice.<\/p>\n<p>Information About Member Dues:<\/p>\n<p>Some Meetup locations are free, but based on participant feedback charging a small amount per event is favorable to a yearly fee or a larger fee when the event space is not free. I think I've come up with a good way to handle this.<\/p>\n<p><br>Your first Meetup attended is free regardless of the location and each subsequent event you attend will cost $5. I would prefer you pay the night of the event with cash or check. When you pay with a card on the Meetup site your $5 turns into $4.12 for the group. If you would prefer to pay with a card we can setup something with PayPal (they only charge fees for large amounts).<\/p>\n<p><br>All money collected will go towards the cost to use Meetup.com, securing future event space and the occasional snack for a meeting. I will start a shareable spreadsheet to keep track of dues and expenses so everyone is aware where their money is going.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.3099975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":17114611,"name":"Carolanne Donovan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/b\/highres_247074139.jpeg","photo_id":247074139,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/b\/member_247074139.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/b\/thumb_247074139.jpeg"}},"members":116,"name":"Sew Good Meetup","id":18674993,"state":"MA","urlname":"Sew-Good-Meetup","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":42.6800003052,"who":"Makers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434425600000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"filmind","name":"Film Industry","id":382},{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"gamedev","name":"Game Development","id":496},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"videoblog","name":"Videoblogging","id":10073},{"urlkey":"youtube","name":"YouTube","id":10483},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"game-design","name":"Game Design","id":19225},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"augmented-reality","name":"Augmented Reality","id":26061},{"urlkey":"virtual-reality","name":"Virtual Reality","id":26062},{"urlkey":"assist-in-creating-youtube-videos","name":"Assist in Creating YouTube Videos","id":68931},{"urlkey":"youtubers","name":"youtubers","id":414102},{"urlkey":"vr","name":"VR","id":1450612}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Metaversal-Boston\/","rating":4.93,"description":"<p><i><b>Metaverse:<\/b>&nbsp;a collective virtual shared space.

The focus is on problems with a technical component. They can be in any field and need not emphasize pure mathematics. However, the research must involve reproducible mathematical calculations or computational procedures. The research should be original -- whether or not it turns out to be novel.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us have interesting research ideas outside our formal area of expertise that we'd like to explore or actually are exploring.&nbsp; Academic research has grown highly compartmentalized.&nbsp; Determining an appropriate publication venue, tracking down relevant prior work, and casting language into field-specific terminology can easily become a full time job.&nbsp; Even determining whether the work has been done before can be quite a challenging task.&nbsp; We're often faced with a choice:&nbsp; spend our free time solving interesting problems or spend it dealing with these tasks. &nbsp; <br> <br>The goal of this group is both to provide a forum for sharing such ideas and to aid members in exploring possible venues for publication where applicable. &nbsp; <br> <br>Here is a quick test to see if you would enjoy this group: <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; Do you tend to come up with interesting ideas, possibly in widely varying fields, with a mathish bent?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then your meetup search criteria may need some work. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; Do you actually have the time and inclination to solve those problems?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then what you're looking for is a grad student. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp; Would you say you do enough quick checking to avoid spending \"a month in the lab\" to \"save an hour in the library\", as the old adage goes?&nbsp; If not, then you may wish to try a magical incantation that goes \"google\". <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp; Are you ok with (unknowingly) doing something that already has been done?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then you need to spend the next 16 years of your life in academia developing cutting edge expertise in one field. <br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp; Would you say you have some sort of academic background in a technical discipline (physics, math, engineering, CS, etc), are familiar with the nature of scientific research, and follow such methods in your own research?&nbsp; I.e., is your approach methodical, reproducible, and technical?&nbsp; If not, then your ideas are brilliant and the establishment is persecuting you and you are way way way too smart for this group.&nbsp; We'd never understand your perpetual motion idea and are too closed minded to hear you endlessly explain your latest conspiracy theory.&nbsp; You're looking for the group next door. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp; Are you open to feedback, including criticism, and including being proven completely wrong?&nbsp; While feedback in our group will be constructive, are you ready to hear -- \"Hey, isn't that just the Jablowski equation?\" or \"Um, that missing minus sign invalidates your entire argument.\"?&nbsp; If not, the you're probably looking for a mutual affirmation group.&nbsp; If you need someone to simply tell you you're a genius, I can recommend this great guy on the corner in Harvard Square.&nbsp; For just $10 he'll tell you that you're the smartest person on the planet and justify it by misquoting various famous people.&nbsp; He services most of the Harvard faculty, from what I hear. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp; Are you open to writing up and presenting your idea?&nbsp; If not, then you probably are onto something really really really big.&nbsp; You should hide the encrypted hard drive in a safe that you sink in the ocean.&nbsp; Don't forget to have (old) Spock cut out a piece of your brain and seal it in an alternate universe to protect you from yourself as well.&nbsp; Otherwise, the government will steal and misuse it, other scientists will plagiarize it, and\/or Apple will patent it and sue you.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The problems our members tackle need not be profound or earth shattering.&nbsp; The subjects can vary all over the place.&nbsp; If you want a flavor of what I've played with recently, you can look at my idea blog \"www.aplaceofsand.com\" (it has a mix of other stuff too -- but the \"Fairness in sentencing\", \"Inflation\", and \"Voting\" articles are representative). &nbsp; <br> <br>For obvious reasons, I'm going to be selective in admission to this group.&nbsp; This isn't (just) because I'm pretentious.&nbsp; I want to ensure that members will share reasonable ideas and offer reasonable feedback.&nbsp; If you read through this huge blurb, you've passed motivation test #1. &nbsp; <br> <br>Motivation test #2 involves sending me some work you did.&nbsp; It can be an academic publication if you have one, or an unpublished piece.&nbsp; For this purpose, it need not be a creative work (a pedagogical one will suffice).&nbsp; However, it should have a technical aspect to it.&nbsp; Also, please provide a brief description of your background and interests. &nbsp; <br> <br>I also reserve the right (and will exercise it) to revoke membership for anyone who meaningfully misrepresents themselves or their work.&nbsp; Really, don't bother.&nbsp; It will be blatantly obvious after 5 minutes of casual conversation.&nbsp; You'll be unhappy and I'll be unhappy, and this group is about fun and happiness. <br> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/highres_438919611.jpeg","photo_id":438919611,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/600_438919611.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/9\/b\/thumb_438919611.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":14139255,"name":"Ken H","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/6\/highres_52982582.jpeg","photo_id":52982582,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/6\/member_52982582.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/6\/thumb_52982582.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"Boston Area Research Projects Group","id":18688633,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Area-Research-Projects-Group","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Researchers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434940422000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beatles","name":"The Beatles","id":153},{"urlkey":"70smusic","name":"70's Music","id":3188},{"urlkey":"60smusic","name":"60's Music","id":3784},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"rock-music","name":"Rock Music","id":21048},{"urlkey":"favorite-beatles-cover-bands-in-the-area","name":"Favorite Beatles Cover Bands in the Area","id":43270},{"urlkey":"john-lennon","name":"John Lennon","id":69633},{"urlkey":"george-harrison","name":"George Harrison","id":69634},{"urlkey":"ringo-starr","name":"Ringo Starr","id":69635},{"urlkey":"listening-to-music","name":"Listening To Music","id":109969},{"urlkey":"beatles-trivia","name":"Beatles Trivia","id":127284},{"urlkey":"beatle-songs","name":"Beatle Songs","id":127285},{"urlkey":"paul-mccartney","name":"Paul McCartney","id":787712},{"urlkey":"beatles-activity-suggestions","name":"Beatles Activity Suggestions","id":820452},{"urlkey":"beatle-people","name":"Beatle People","id":1089842}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Beatles-Society\/","rating":4.63,"description":"<p>Do you love the Beatles?

Militarism discourages serious reflection on the moral gravity of war.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>A militaristic culture derives its power from a few basic assumptions:<\/p>\n<p>The military is a force for good;<span> <br><\/span><span>The military is only used in defense;<\/span><span>&nbsp;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>Therefore military service is an honorable profession;<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>Therefore supporting the troops is a patriotic duty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We believe these are faulty assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>When we thank veterans for keeping us free and safe, we reassure them that particular, current wars are good, and necessary to keep us free and safe. When we congratulate teenagers for joining the military, we discourage them from considering the spiritual and psychological consequences of violence, enmity, destruction and the taking of human life. When we champion the United States as \u201cthe greatest country on Earth,\u201d we overlook the dark side of American history: American exceptionalism provides the rich soil in which militarism takes root.<\/p>\n<p>Militarism creates a convenient blind spot for the terrible costs of war. At its most bold, it dares and encourages young people to sacrifice their lives, and possibly their souls, at the unholy altar of the State.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Militarism is a spiritual disease akin to the worshiping of idols.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Ten Commandments reads Thou Shall Not Kill; Jesus Christ was the Prince of Peace; and Catholic tradition condemns war in the strongest terms. Manifest Destiny, American Exceptionalism, and Christian Nationalism have no basis in the Catholic understanding of the world. As explained by Cardinal Walter Kasper, an overly strong identification of the Gospel with a particular culture or nation is an \u201cecclesiological heresy.\u201d Killing does not become okay simply because the killer was wearing the stars and stripes. The Bible makes it very clear that God judges people according to His laws, not Man\u2019s laws.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObey God rather than men.\u201d Acts 5:29 <br>\u201cNo one man can serve two masters.\u201d Matthew 6:24 <br>\u201cThou Shalt Have No God Before Me.\u201d Exodus 20:3<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/catholicsagainstmilitarism.com\/manifesto\/\">Please click this link to read the whole statement.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Boston CAM is an independent grassroots effort.

The year-long exhibit will examine the life history of the motorcycle, from the pioneering 1800\u2019s era - when an engine was simply bolted to a bicycle  \u2013 through the present day technological and artistic triumphs achieved by manufacturers in Asia, Europe and the United States, leading to a shift in cultural perceptions, and a world-wide fan base of enthusiasts.  The exhibit features some of the rarest, most technically innovative, historically significant, and beautiful motorcycles of all time, brought together within the context of the history of the automobile, examining technological and style parallels and the evolution of the motorcycle from an inexpensive alternative to the motorcar to a distinct entity and potent social and cultural symbol.  Abounding with visually compelling examples of the impact of the motorcycle on popular culture, the exhibit will recall for the visitor such classics as \u201cEasy Rider\u201d, \u201cThe Wild One\u201d, \u201cThe World\u2019s Fastest Indian\u201d, and other iconic cinematic portrayals of the motorcycle as the ultimate expression of freedom. Iconic brands such as BMW, Ducati, Harley Davidson, Honda and Indian will be among the featured marques. The competitive speed arena will be well represented at \u201cBeauty of the Beast\u201d with the 1970 Harley Davidson Sportster Powered Streamliner from the Bonneville Motorcycle family, and both the Pro Mod Suzuki TL 1000 and Suzuki Hyabusa motorcycles used by NHRA Pro Stock Motorcycle racer Sam Herwitz, a Newton, MA resident and drag racing legend, all part of the racing and competitive riding section of the exhibit. The very newest, most exotic motorcycles the world factories have to offer, including the Ducati 119\nSuperleggera \u201csuperbike\u201d will be on display as will a complete representation of the century\u2019s best in motorcycling.  Legends like the Vincent Black Shadow from England, a rare MV Augusta, and a historically significant 1935 Morgan Super Sport Three-Wheeler will highlight the evolutionary variations of the motorcycle.  European greats including the 1923 BMW r32, which was part of the Art of the Motorcycle at Guggenheim, acclaimed for rocketing BMW\u2019s motorcycle success with its masterful design concept that would endure the rest of the century, and the 1935 BMW r17, representing the height of the Art Deco movement, will punctuate the mechanical, artistic, design and styling aspects of the Motorcycle.   \u201cLeather and Lace \u2013 Women and Motorcycles\u201d, will explore the relationship of women to motorcycles and focus on some outstanding individuals who made history on the seat of their own machine and in the motorcycle world, whether breaking barriers, making their own mark or through outstanding feats of their own.  The \u201cBeauty of the Beast\u201d exhibit runs through the year, concurrently with the popular summer \u201cLawn Events\u201d auto shows schedule.  Admission is: $10 for adults, $5 children, seniors, and active military.

In that the Logan Airport is part of our neighborhood, we'll try to have an air travel-themed name for each meetup - unless and until we run out of ideas, that is. The thought is that at least initially East Piers Park will serve as the gathering location and starting point of our meetups, as the park provides an easy access to the Harborwalk as well as the Greenway (and from there, the Bremen Street Park and the East Boston High track). But Wood Island Park\/Constitution Beach\/Belle Isle Marsh could also serve as locations, which should be convenient for those living in Orient Heights.

Who were the Druids?? And more importantly who are they today? What does this tradition have to offer you and the world? Join the group to find out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Members will gather for monthly \"hearthsides\" which are pot-luck social gatherings and discussions on a diverse range of topics related to the ancient to the modern understanding of Druidry including its history and folklore, philosophy, theology, environmental and social applications, and how this earth-based spiritual tradition can inform today's global issues. Like many modern pagan traditions, Druidry exists in the sphere of a personal\/experiential path, without dogma, that each of us must learn to walk and interpret for ourselves. Seen today more as a \"spiritually informed philosophy of life\" than a religion in the traditional sense, this path is completely compatible with many lifestyles regardless of your own cultural and\/or religions background. <br><\/p>\n<p>Members will also be invited to participate in the eight sacred seasonal holy days of the Druid calendar, which will be held outdoors in natural settings. <br><\/p>\n<p>Who should join this group? Anyone interested in learning more about this unique spiritual tradition.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need to be of Celtic ancestry to join? Certainly not. All that is required is an open mind.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need to be a pagan to join? Certainly not. Modern Druidry (often referred to as neo-druidry) is a sophisticated spiritually-informed philosophy and way-of-life more than a traditional \"religion\" per say and it's ideas can be applied in many dimensions of life regardless of your background. Arising from ancient indo-european sources, yet informed by in modern ideas and constantly evolving, Druidry today transcends eastern and western worldviews as it transcends the spiritual and scientific divides to offer a way of \"being in the world\" that is firmly grounded by its connection to nature and the environment, yet committed to helping humanity grow towards a more enlightened society. <br><\/p>\n<p>This is a closed group and only members can see internal content including the locations of events.<br><\/p>\n<p>Members will be approved based on their expressed desire to particulate actively in social\/educational events as well as the more experiential celebrations. Members ought to have the minimum physical constitution and interest to participate in events held outdoors in natural locations under diverse weather conditions. The eight sacred days of the Druid calendar will be celebrated shine barring extreme situations, and if you are only an \"indoor celebrant\" or have an aversion to getting your shoes and trousers a bit muddy then this group might not be for you. Locations will be accessible to the Boston area as much as possible. <br><\/p>\n<p>This group is the initial step towards establishing a local \"seed group\" within the Order of Bards Ovates &amp; Druids (OBOD). Active involvement in the Order's distance-learning training program is highly encouraged but not required, nor is membership in OBOD a requirement for this group.

So feel free to join us for some good eats, better conversation, and best books.<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/4\/0\/highres_439618432.jpeg","photo_id":439618432,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/4\/0\/600_439618432.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/4\/0\/thumb_439618432.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189742377,"name":"Andra Langoussis","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/5\/highres_251292645.jpeg","photo_id":251292645,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/5\/member_251292645.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/5\/thumb_251292645.jpeg"}},"members":110,"name":"Boston Ladies' Fantasy Book Club","id":18734039,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Ladies-Fantasy-Book-Club","category":{"name":"sci-fi\/fantasy","id":29,"shortname":"sci-fi-fantasy"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Sudbury","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1436642700000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"guitar","name":"Guitar","id":22364},{"urlkey":"acoustic-guitar","name":"Acoustic Guitar","id":36407},{"urlkey":"acoustic-jams","name":"Acoustic Jams","id":40464},{"urlkey":"jam-sessions","name":"Jam Sessions","id":48840},{"urlkey":"acoustic-music","name":"Acoustic Music","id":53946},{"urlkey":"music-jamming","name":"Music Jamming","id":72967}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MetroWest-Acoustic-Music-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Lets get together for some music jams.

I will also link to other foreign policy events in the area.

possibilities available to the regular person to building an online business in whatever industry you choose.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/toptierhomebusiness.leadpages.co\/boston-meetup\/\"><strong>Get Meetup updates and Online businessbuilding and marketing tips here!<\/strong><\/a><\/p> \n<p>As a member of this group, you will learn real tactics and strategies for using the internet to grow your small business.<\/p> \n<p><strong>When it comes to marketing on the interwebs, your website has one of two purposes:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>1) As a Lead Generation tool (that you can follow up with on the phone or by email etc)<\/p> \n<p>2) As an ecommerce site, to sell your products directly from your site.<\/p> \n<p><strong>What goal you have depends on what type of business you are running, but whichever it is, this group is for you if:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>- You don\u2019t have the slightest clue what you are doing when it comes to internet marketing, BUT you are open to learning.<\/p> \n<p>- You don\u2019t yet have a website, but would like one, and would like to know how to get one made.<\/p> \n<p>- You do have a website, but can\u2019t get any traffic to it.<\/p> \n<p>- You are getting traffic, but you can\u2019t get any leads or sales (you have no conversions) - You would like to meet other people who are making money online (and are willing to share what they are doing)<\/p> \n<p>- You have heard of the whole \u2018social media trend\u2019 and how marketing your business on sites like Facebook can be very powerful but you don\u2019t know how to do it.<\/p> \n<p>- You are successfully generating leads and making sales online, and would love to share your strategies with others who are also getting great results, so you can all benefit.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>1) \u201cWho created this group?\u201d<\/p> \n<p>We did \u2013 Richardson Archil and Eu Ching ANG.<\/p> \n<p>Richardson Archil is a Go-getting, Kick ass Writer, Self-speaker, Poet &amp; Comedian. Totally motivated &amp; dedicated to achieving his goals!<\/p> \n<p>Eu Ching is a Work-at-Home Mom - I assist my husband in the management of his medical clinic as well as running a successful internet marketing home business. I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, 2 turtles, countless fish, a visiting stray cat and run 3 blogs - MomsWisdom.net (parenting), TheEntrepreneurMom.com (Find your Inner Mogul) &amp; BetterFamilyHealth.org (Get off your Tush &amp; Exercise! My hubby's medical blog).<\/p> \n<p>2) \u201cWhy have you created this group?\u201d<\/p> \n<p><strong>There are 3 reasons for forming this group:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>- Some of the best ideas have come from a mastermind (a small group that shares ideas). There are a lot of internet marketers in Boston who would love to meet others who \u2018speak their language\u2019, but up until now, have never had.<\/p> \n<p>- We love teaching. At each meet up, we will teach a new internet marketing strategy (eg Facebook pay per click, writing an automated email follow-up etc) I also plan to record each one of these sessions and share them with my own list and with members of the group who missed out.<\/p> \n<p>- We would like to offer people quality information that actually works. Anything you learn in this group is proven to work<\/p> \n<p>\u2013 We only share what has worked for us. This is unlike some groups out there, where there\u2019s usually someone up on stage who\u2019s never made money online in his life, talking as if he has (usually to sell their \u2018make money online\u2019 course)<\/p> \n<p>3) How many people usually show up?<\/p> \n<p>To be honest, this is still a small group \u2013 so not too many. But that\u2018s usually good because it means you will get a lot more 1-on-1 attention if you need it, and we can keep things very informal. Eg. You can bring along your laptop and get individual attention, or show the group what you are working on.<\/p> \n<p>4) How long do the Meetups usually go for?<\/p> \n<p>Generally around 2 hours. We can meet around 7pm and likely finish 9ish. But you are welcome to leave early or stay later, it\u2019s entirely up to you.<\/p> \n<p>5) Does it cost anything to attend?<\/p> \n<p>Nope. The meetups are free and we intend to keep it that way.<\/p> \n<p>6) What if I don\u2019t know anything about internet marketing \u2013 Am I still welcome to come?<\/p> \n<p>Absolutely. Most people who attend are just starting out so don\u2019t feel like you have to be some internet marketing geek like us to be a member.<\/p> \n<p>7) Do I need to participate, or can I just watch?<\/p> \n<p>It\u2019s up to you. If you just want to watch the presentations, that\u2019s fine, of course. But if you have questions\/comments and would like to join the conversation, that\u2019s also encouraged.<\/p> \n<p>8) How do I know when the next meetup is being held \u2013 Where are those details?<\/p> \n<p>Just bookmark this site right now. As long as you check back every few days, you will see where and when the next meetup is.<\/p> \n<p>Also you can join as a member, it\u2019s free! Then you will get an email as soon as we announce the times and locations of the next meetup.<\/p> \n<p><strong>We only have one rule:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Please don\u2019t use these meetings to pitch your business. You are welcome to tell others what you do of course, but there is a huge difference between self-promotion and being so aggressive about it that it scares off our new members ;D<\/p> \n<p>That\u2019s about it. If you are still reading, then you are obviously interested in learning about this stuff. So why not come along to our next meetup? Who knows? You could get one idea that increases your bottom line by 20% this year, or you could meet someone you end up doing a JV with.<\/p> \n<p>But you will only know if you show up.<\/p> \n<p>See you there, <\/p> \n<p>Richardson &amp; Eu Ching<\/p>\n<p>PS <a href=\"https:\/\/toptierhomebusiness.leadpages.co\/boston-meetup\/\"><strong>Get Meetup updates and Online businessbuilding and marketing tips here!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":187106567,"name":"Richardson ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/6\/c\/e\/highres_246014030.jpeg","photo_id":246014030,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/6\/c\/e\/member_246014030.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/6\/c\/e\/thumb_246014030.jpeg"}},"members":92,"name":"Boston Entrepreneur Online Marketing Business Network","id":18790776,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Entrepreneur-Online-Marketing-Business-Network","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Boston MindStormers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Canton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438453499000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"healthy-weight-loss","name":"Healthy Weight Loss","id":58776}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/South-Shore-Weight-Loss-Wellness-Group-A-Happy-Healthy-You\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>I am a registered dietitian who has set up this group in the hopes of establishing a climate of trust and support for those struggling with or interested in weight loss; it is a forum for open and honest discussions to take place as to result in ownership in your health and longevity.

Group travel to nearby resorts (150 mile radius or so) may also be an option at some point (members would have private condos with optional activities or get-togethers offered.)<\/p>","lon":-71.5299987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":132035352,"name":"Scott McAvoy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/3\/2\/highres_249571026.jpeg","photo_id":249571026,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/3\/2\/member_249571026.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/3\/2\/thumb_249571026.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Blackstone Area Travel Addicts Meetup","id":18794365,"state":"MA","urlname":"Blackstone-area-Travel-Addicts-Meetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.0299987793,"who":"Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438535040000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"projectmgmt","name":"Project Management","id":3438},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"education","name":"Education","id":8476},{"urlkey":"information-technology","name":"Information Technology","id":15568},{"urlkey":"elearning","name":"eLearning","id":20764},{"urlkey":"e-learning","name":"e-Learning","id":21274},{"urlkey":"technology-professionals","name":"Technology Professionals","id":22203},{"urlkey":"higher-education","name":"Higher Education","id":25273},{"urlkey":"cio","name":"CIO","id":25719},{"urlkey":"e-learning-systems","name":"E-Learning Systems","id":49228},{"urlkey":"cto","name":"CTO","id":141917},{"urlkey":"it-professionals","name":"IT Professionals","id":164111}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Higher-Ed-IT-Professionals\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Higher Ed IT Professionals brings together people working in Higher Ed IT for networking and learning purposes.

We hope to have a lively discussion about the model's content, application in practice, to deepen our understanding of the system, and to see in what ways the ideas of socionics can help us to see ourselves and others more clearly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anyone with an interest in psychology, spirituality, or typology is welcome to join. Beginners are welcomed. The only requirement is an open mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships. This group is for people to learn and discuss Socionics for the purpose of self-typing and self-discovery, to find the right partner whether it is for a short or long term relationship, to improve their current social, familial, and romantic relationships, and most definitely to connect to other people who are interested in examining their lives and relationships through the Socionical lens.<\/p>\n<p>With this group, you'll be able to find out your Socionics type and learn more about your strengths, values and attitudes towards the world around you, and how you interact with those of different types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Socionics, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/worldsocionics.blogspot.co.uk\/2014\/07\/an-introduction-to-socionics-part-1.html\">Introduction to Socionics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We also have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/108330762848816\">Facebook group<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to join our wider community at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/worldsocionicssociety\">World Socionics Society<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally PLEASE support our meetup group by pledging a pound or two per month at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/WorldSocionics\">Patreon page.<\/a><\/p>\n<br>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/highres_440506778.jpeg","photo_id":440506778,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/600_440506778.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/b\/a\/thumb_440506778.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13538250,"name":"Jack Oliver Aaron","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/f\/6\/c\/highres_246568524.jpeg","photo_id":246568524,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/f\/6\/c\/member_246568524.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/f\/6\/c\/thumb_246568524.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"Boston Socionics Society","id":18795123,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonSocionics","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Socionists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Andover","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438607361000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newcareer","name":"New Career","id":2790},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"career-coaching","name":"Career Coaching","id":20251},{"urlkey":"networking-for-job-seekers","name":"Networking for Job Seekers","id":21836},{"urlkey":"job-search","name":"Job Search","id":21900},{"urlkey":"careers","name":"Career","id":22888},{"urlkey":"career-advice-career-help-interview-skills","name":"Career Advice, Career Help, Interview Skills","id":26658},{"urlkey":"career-change-and-career-search","name":"Career Change and Career Search","id":171787}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CareerLab\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Along with moving and buying a house, searching for a job is commonly listed by many authorities as one of the most stressful times of your life.&nbsp; The task is so challenging that some say the first thing you should do is get a good night sleep!

The NESFA clubhouse is located at 504 Medford Street in Somerville. <br> NESFA hosts a variety of events at the clubhouse in the course of a month. All events at the clubhouse are free to anyone. You don't have to be a member and you do not have to join. All you have to do is open the door and walk in. Game Days, Game Nights, Media Days, Book Discussion Group, the Annual Picnic, the Halloween party, the Bah Humbug game day, and the general Wednesday night gathering are all free to attend. Details for each will be posted in each event listing. <br> Boskone runs in February, and it's one of the longest running SF conventions out there. Many famous authors attend each year, along with editors and publishers. There are discussion panels, nightly events, an art show, filkers, a dealer's room, and I personally run the game room. <br> NESFA is also the parent organization of NEGC (New England Gaming Convention). Two have run thus far. Both were 1-day gaming cons. <br> NESFA Press is the publishing wing of NESFA. NESFAns handle all aspects of the work, from the negotiations to the editing. <br> You'll see NESFA set up at the Boston Book Festival as well. <br> info@nesfa.org is the general email address for nesfa. You can also contact me at my email address. The web address is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nesfa.org\">www.nesfa.org<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> To get to the clubhouse, you can take the 80 bus (drops you off a block away in either direction), and the 89 bus (drops you off on Broadway.

With this goal in mind, I've created this Meetup Group. It's completely free and will meet regularly --- if you're looking to improve your Spanish, German, and French, and later even other languages, then you're on the right page.<\/p>\n<p>I'm bilingual, fluent in both English and Spanish, and would like to improve my German and French. I created my first Meetup Group when I was living in Germany and it was a lot of fun. Here's an idea of how the setup has worked in the past:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. The group practices speaking a language for 30 minutes and then switches. Usually the group will naturally break down into 3-4 smaller groups practicing whatever languages they choose. <br>2. You may also practice your language of choice for the entire session if you find someone who also wishes to practice that language. <br>3. If we all wish to practice one language, e.g. French, we can speak French the entire time!<\/p>\n<p>Join the group to meet cool new people, learn about their cultures and stories, discuss interesting topics, and to progress in your comprehension and speaking in different languages. All levels are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>This group is FREE!

That's are school motto. And the most important reason to join us. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms is a Boston-based school that studies and trains Historical European Martial Arts. We teach two styles: the Longsword tradition of Johannes Lichtenauer and the Scottish tradition Broadsword and Smallsword. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers are motivated towards a demanding physical and intellectual goal. It is not simply enough to improve athletically - the study of historical arts requires a commitment to documents written hundreds of years ago, frequently in another language. In short: we are nerds.<\/p>\n<p>And fencing is a thinking sport; there are tactics and strategy to go along with the history.<\/p>\n<p>Many Historical fencers are fans of science fiction or fantasy literature. Many of us are gamers. Now we have a physical activity which links our other passions into one awesome life. And introduces us to other members of the same community.<\/p>\n<p>Athena fencers show up with a wide variety of backgrounds and skills in physical activities. And wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some are former modern fencers or kendoka. Others have never before found a sport they liked. The classes are small and always tailored to make sure everyone can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>You should join Athena School of Arms because you want to fight with swords. And to become more fit. And to learn about healthy exercise for life. And for an intellectually challenging activity. And to hit people with swords.<\/p>\n<p>A typical class is 75 minutes long. We start with 30 minutes of physical preparation. A warm-up is followed by work on either agility or speed. Then we have a Power and Core circuit.<\/p>\n<p>Then we have the actual sword curriculum. Every class starts with footwork. Attacks and defenses are developed. Progressively more protective gear and higher intensity are introduced to move towards understanding the historical fight.<\/p>\n<p>We also regularly engage in free play and have monthly, friendly class tournaments. And these are followed by all going out to dinner together. <br><\/p>\n<p>It is amazing to see some of the friendships developed within the school. Most of us were invited to the weddings of 3 different members. <br><\/p>\n<p>Athena School of Arms also works to reconstruct the Dagger, Sword and Buckler, and Grappling arts. Training includes free play, drills, test cutting, and physical fitness; together, these elements help students to understand and recreate combat on the battlefield, the list, and in personal defense. <br><\/p>\n<p>Starting in the 14th century the people who trained in the use of the sword started to write down the instruction they received in the art of fencing. Our group, and groups like ours from all over the world, work to reconstruct the Historical European Martial Arts. And they are martial arts. What we do is not choreographed and we use realistic weapon simulators. We put on appropriate, modern protective gear and fence at high-intensity.<\/p>","lon":-71.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/4\/6\/highres_442822342.jpeg","photo_id":442822342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/4\/6\/600_442822342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/4\/6\/thumb_442822342.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":191629394,"name":"Steven Hirsch","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/d\/8\/highres_249018648.jpeg","photo_id":249018648,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/d\/8\/member_249018648.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/d\/8\/thumb_249018648.jpeg"}},"members":76,"name":"Athena School of Arms - Historical Swordsmanship","id":18855357,"state":"MA","urlname":"Athena-School-of-Arms-Historical-Swordsmanship","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Athenian Historical Fencers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440205714000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"geek","name":"Geek Culture","id":10493},{"urlkey":"roleplaying-games-rpgs","name":"Roleplaying Games (RPGs)","id":16425},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"console-gaming","name":"Console Gaming","id":28643},{"urlkey":"online-dating","name":"Online Dating","id":40347}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Video-Gamers-looking-for-love\/","rating":0,"description":"We are looking for video gamers who are interested in meeting other video gamers!

ADAM is a closed group, so if you happened upon this page by accident you will need to reach out to the organizer (Patrick) to inquire. This group was inspired by an expressed need for a group where like-minded men can spend time with each other while enhancing personal growth, relationships, and spiritual connection through socialization, discussion, and activities. Our group is not intended to compete with other similar groups, but to support each other in offering content which supplements one another's programming. ADAM will act to support our brothers in each of our unique ways of expressing our maleness. Through interaction and creative expression we will strive to be our most authentic selves in an open, non-judgmental setting. In this space, you are welcome and encouraged to define and express who you are by your own truth and definition. You may find that your own expression of who you are as a man (i.e. what appeals to you, how you present, act or behave) conflicts with what is outlined by others to be appropriate or acceptable for men in mainstream society, and may often leave you feeling shamed for not fitting more easily into a particular mold. You may even modify your life to accommodate these expectations, leaving you unhappy or unfulfilled in this lifetime. This group's message is about freedom - emotional, physical, spiritual, and societal, and presenting yourself to the world as you are, proudly and boldly. <br><\/p>\n<p>As a group, we will strive to access deep, unconditional love for ourselves, each other, and our relationships in general. It's a complicated world, and ADAM's hope is to provide something far less complicated. So come in out of the world for a while. Unplug and experience something new, and allow it to provide something you may take into your week, and into your life. <br><\/p>\n<p>ADAM is run on donations only for the time being, as we strive to provide something that is easy for everyone to experience. The only thing asked in return is that you bring good intentions, that you value healthy living in mind and body, and always respect your brothers.

This is for those who believe in ending the New Jim Crow. &nbsp; <br> <br>This is also a group dedicated to statistical based arguments rather than hyperbole or sensationalism. <br> <br>Yes, heroin and methamphetamine are dangerous and very addictive drugs, but the drug war against them and other drugs cause way more social harms than the drugs themselves. We can look to progressive cities, states, countries such as Vancouver B.C., Colorado, Washington, and Portugal for inspiration. Decriminalization of cannabis and even cocaine and heroin is not enough as that leaves the black market in place which still allows for unrestricted access to minors, predatory drug sales, violence, reduced but still continued mass incarceration of minorities (due to racial profiling and imprisonment of disadvantaged minorities who join the drug game but get caught at a higher rate than their peers who are not minorities), animosity towards police in urban communities, ruined lives due to childhood errors in judgement and lack of opportunity (due to a criminal record for those youth who sell drugs and are caught), etc. <br> <br>We will start by organizing activities to gather signatures for the 4 ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana as well as to register citizens to vote at various locations throughout Massachusetts (signature collection and voter registration tables at grocery stores, at concerts, etc.). I need help from those who are like minded and who are interested in voter registration and drug policy reform and activism. <br> <br>If you are new to this topic, books to consider reading would be The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society by Carl Hart, Our Right To Drugs: The Case for a Free Market Paperback by Thomas Szasz, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs Hardcover by Johann Hari, Saying Yes by Jacob Sullum, and&nbsp;http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/09\/14\/440327585\/ta-nehisi-coates-outlines-path-to-mass-incarceration-in-the-atlantic<br> <br>Another idea would be to have some book club meetings to read some of the above books as well as others that are of interest to the members of this meetup. This is not so much a social group as a group that is dedicated to actual action. <br> <br>Let's start with reform around cannabis and after that is achieved let's start advocating for change around other drugs. &nbsp;Too many people are losing friends and family to prison and to drug overdose in our state.<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":34991262,"name":"Mark","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/6\/1\/highres_249773601.jpeg","photo_id":249773601,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/6\/1\/member_249773601.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/6\/1\/thumb_249773601.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"Working to end the New Jim Crow in Massachusetts","id":18934392,"state":"MA","urlname":"Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442341834000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"multicultural","name":"Multicultural","id":16368},{"urlkey":"social-justice","name":"Social Justice","id":17986},{"urlkey":"recent-college-grads","name":"recent college grads","id":18778},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"college-students","name":"College Students","id":29723},{"urlkey":"inclusive-diverse","name":"Inclusive & Diverse","id":114172}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/getkonnected\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Get Konnected! is Boston\u2019s first and only urban professional and business networking event that brings together urban professionals, business executives, entrepreneurs, international professionals of diverse cultures, across industries and sectors to enrich and enhance their professional development, forge business relationships, and expand their personal and professional networks.<\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/7\/9\/highres_446501593.jpeg","photo_id":446501593,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/7\/9\/600_446501593.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/7\/9\/thumb_446501593.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189387874,"name":"Colette Phillps","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/1\/highres_249901393.jpeg","photo_id":249901393,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/1\/member_249901393.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/7\/1\/thumb_249901393.jpeg"}},"members":108,"name":"Get Konnected! in Boston","id":18935013,"state":"MA","urlname":"getkonnected","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Get Konnectors!"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Jamaica Plain","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442343189000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"dads","name":"Dads","id":468},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"education","name":"Education","id":8476},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"music-for-children","name":"Music for Children","id":15226},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"child-health","name":"Child Health","id":44140}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jamaica-Plain-Parents-and-Kids-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>We are a group of moms and dads looking to create a sense of community and village based on family, health and wellness, education, and music events.

There will also be time for sharing, discussion and journaling after each meditation to deepen your experience and learning, and to socialize at the end. You're encouraged to bring a journal or notebook and pen.<\/p>\n<p>We practice meditation not to get better at meditating; rather, to get better at living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy. We meditate to connect to our best and highest self and all the inner resources and wisdom available to us, and, of course, to experience the deeply relaxed, pleasurable states that arise with it.<\/p>\n<p>One of our participants said that my guided meditations and our discussions are like \"therapy for the soul\".&nbsp; I thought that was so cool a way to describe it!&nbsp; Actually, tho', it's the connecting to your soul\/spirit-self that is therapeutic for your mind and body.&nbsp; You get the point, tho'.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>You can bring your own spirituality to your meditations. The paradigm I offer through the meditations and our discussions is based on the premise that we are all one energy and non-physical Spirit consciousness in individual physical forms and personalities, here to create and expand from those uniquely created human desires. Therefore, from this source energy\/Spirit, we have the ability to easily and joyfully create the life and experiences we desire.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe it\u2019s time for us to awaken to the fullness of who we are as Spiritual beings, to evolve, and to become more and more competent with our innate abilities for creating what we really want: peace, harmony, joy, happiness, fulfillment, love, abundance, freedom, etc. I believe we are here to live a happy, harmonious and successful life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Each time we gather, we'll have a different theme to help you live with less stress and anxiety, and to build and reinforce positive thinking patterns, beliefs and inner narratives that will support you in living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, we'll have 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between to help you carry the positive feelings and lessons experienced into your day and life, and to connect deeply with each other in these meaningful ways.<\/p>\n<p>This is a perfect time to let go of stress and \"busy-ness\", and to fully let go and relax into bliss.

This group is co-ed and open to anyone 18+ as long as they are respectful to other players and willing to play a casual game of soccer. As this group is new, I'd like to have at least 15 people sign up before choosing a location, but I was thinking somewhere in Acton-Stow-Maynard-Concord-Lincoln. Please message me your location \/ time preferences, they will all be taken into account. Also, I am looking for another admin to help with organization as I am not always available, even though I will try my best. It is also worth mentioning that though I intend this group to be free, it is possible we may have to collect a small fee (probably ~$5) in order to secure a field.

The fall weekend is at Pinkham Notch, NH. The winter weekend alternates between Pinkham Notch and Sargent Camp in Peterborough, NH. &nbsp;We&nbsp;sponsor at least one chamber music play-in day per year. Signups happen here and also at our AMC website (<a href=\"http:\/\/amcboston.org\/committee\/music\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/amcboston.org\/committee\/music<\/a>) and our Facebook page (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AMC-Mountains-and-Music-322357494465589\/?fref=ts\">AMC Mountains and Music<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>For the weekends, instrumentalists join together to play chamber and early music as well as to rehearse and perform several orchestral pieces. We welcome any orchestral instrument - strings, brass, woodwinds, timpani, etc. - and early instruments, such as recorder. Instrumentalists should be able to sight-read. Singers rehearse, then perform, a large choral work with the orchestra and form informal groups to sing madrigals, rounds, and other small ensemble pieces. During the winter weekend, there is a third-day option that includes a talent show on the final night, where you can showcase any special skill, whether musical, poetic, juggling, or whatever. Listeners, usually spouses, are always welcome to our weekends. Weekends are enjoyed by from 80 - 120 attendees.<\/p>\n<p>Our one-day play-in is usually in March and most recently is being held in Newton, MA. We help attending musicians form compatible groups for four 45-minute playing sessions. Our play-ins range in size from 40 - 70 musicians.

Through their innovation and hard work, the organization has been able to provide its members with educational resources, a valuable Newsletter, Workshops, Adventures, Children's Parties, Special Interest and Support Groups, and much more. As TMC has grown over the years to serve more than 350 families, we continue to work hard to help all mothers in various times of need. In addition to supporting our members, we give to the local community through a variety of fund-raising efforts. <\/p>\n<p>TMC was created not only to provide resources and fun things for mothers to do with their children, but to serve as a venue for mothers to share and build their skills by volunteering to help maintain this growing organization. TMC is entirely volunteer based. It's about both giving and giving back to our community. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of being a member, and to also contribute in any way they can.

WE ARE ON A BREAK FOR NOW. Two reasons: first I'll be traveling for a bit and even though David is staying here, but... It looks like we don't have too many students who show up. Basically we have to cancel very often because no one comes. So we've decided to give it a bit of time and see what to do with it. <br>Please check back with us mid April. In a mean time, David and me will continue to give private lessons. <br>Here is my email: anastasiyadumma@gmail.com Please, always feel free to email me with any questions. <br><br>I will also have to step down to basic membership on meetup website so they don't charge me. So some of you might see \"pending membership\" or something like this. Please don't get it wrong, we love you and do not want to exclude anybody, but... Paying this little fee is kind a feels weird at the moment since we are going on the break. <br> <br> <br>Usually we get quite a few beginners, so if you are just starting don't be shy, you definitely can join us. If you have been playing for some time I am sure you will find a lot of new and helpful ideas as well. If the level will be very different then we might divide it to two groups eventually. <br> <br>Half of the class time is dedicated to a consecutive curriculum. I try to choose themes that are relevant to everybody in the class. We might talk about some aspects of technique, or reading, or theory etc. The other half of the class time I usually help students with their individual questions. <br> <br>I see this class as a supportive and motivational environment for your self-teaching process. <br> <br>This is PAY-WHAT-YOU-WANT class. We kindly ask you to support your teachers and Westland Guitars that provided the space. <br> <br>There are two professional guitar teachers for you: David and Anastasiya. We lead the class together. Usually we divide the group into two sections in order to address more precisely students' needs. <br> <br>Let me say couple words about us. We both graduated from Berklee College of Music, both are playing guitar for a while while. We both have a lot of experience teaching, yet every class still feels very fresh and new! ) <br> <br>We really enjoy teaching these groups classes a lot! Being able to help people is really a joy.

When you give this a try, you'll be able to meet quality local singles that live near you. Why waste time with dead end relationships when you will feel far better connecting with someone special you can actually see face-to-face? According to recent studies, Americans are marrying later. In fact, as of 2014, single people in the United States outnumber the married,1 meaning that if you are currently single, you\u2019re in good company! One reason for this could be that the demands of modern life don\u2019t leave much time to look for love: with the typical US work week now at 47 hours or more,2 singles who want to get a toe on the professional ladder are finding their leisure time is at a premium. Of course, just because increasing numbers who are finding themselves single, it doesn\u2019t mean that they wish to stay that way. DJ Chris Fiores Singles Dance Party is an enjoyable, relaxing and social way to meet hundreds of professional local singles. Join Us this and every Friday Night at Angelica's 49 S Main St, Middleton, MA. Never a cover charge. Plenty of free parking. Dine, Dance, Mix, Mingle and Meet Someone New And Exciting. Indeed, many are finding that the best solution to the work\/life dilemma is to seek a compromise: it\u2019s not about trying to ignore the desire for love, instead it is a matter of getting smarter about finding it.","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":78303272,"name":"DJ Chris Fiore","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/f\/d\/highres_252390973.jpeg","photo_id":252390973,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/f\/d\/member_252390973.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/f\/d\/thumb_252390973.jpeg"}},"members":479,"name":"Professionals Mix, Mingle, Dine & Dance","id":19041929,"state":"MA","urlname":"Professionals-Mix-Mingle-Dine-Dance","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"VIP's"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Waltham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445275906000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beautyindustry","name":"Beauty Industry","id":2369},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"antiaging","name":"Anti-Aging","id":9862},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"salons-spas","name":"Salons & Spas","id":15409},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"beauty-professionals","name":"Beauty Professionals","id":17059},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"businesss-referral-netowrking","name":"Businesss Referral Netowrking","id":39708},{"urlkey":"nail-technicians","name":"Nail Technicians","id":59781},{"urlkey":"referral-networking","name":"Referral Networking","id":65618},{"urlkey":"nail-spa-owners","name":"Nail Spa Owners","id":116998},{"urlkey":"licensed-estheticians","name":"Licensed Estheticians","id":303981},{"urlkey":"cosmetology","name":"Cosmetology","id":1171542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Waltham-Entrepreneurs-Spa-Meetup-for-men-women\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for any man or woman to come enjoy like minded individuals who appreciate networking and referrals, enjoying a night of pampering and drinks while noshing on some delicious bites.

I hope you will join and come out to meet us soon but if now is not the right time for you kink will always be here just as it always has and just as it always will. So if the right time does come about soon we look forward to welcoming you to our small and supportive community. The right community can make all the difference in the world and that's what we hope for all who decide to join.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Newbie Primer<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If you are new to kink and nervous its absolutely normal. It can be one of the strongest emotional decisions you make in your life! Fortunately theres is a silver lining there- We were all in your shoes at the beginning and we promise it gets easier (and fun and kinkier) over time. And its definitely worth it. Bottom line though: if you don't tell us how you feel we can't help you! We want to be here for you! Reach Out! Send a member a message and we will work with you to make things right.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of kink is to help people feel confident in their ability to seek out and achieve sexual pleasure. There are few institutions in the world geared towards helping people with that. In open society sex is not allowed. But the reality is we all need grounding in this. If you join our group we promise to do everything we can to help you achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>Kink is about lots of things but ultimately there is one thing that takes precedence above all else- you! <b>What is a Munch?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>A munch is a social gathering for people interested in kink (kinksters) and the BDSM community. Come learn about this alternative expression of sexuality in a safe and supportive environment.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Munch_(BDSM)\">Read more about what a munch is by clicking here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Values<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to be as open and welcome as possible to kinksters including everyone from the brand-spanking new (pun-intended) to the experienced and wise. Come learn and explore in a community of like-minded folks. Kink can be explored on one's own but it takes a community to grow and understand it in the fullest best way possible.<\/p>\n<p><b>Privacy and Exclusivity vs. Inclusivity<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Privacy is very important to us so the group is kept up to only include active members. That's why the enrollment is so small! But we promise that every member is an active member. Basically what that means is you are free to join but if you don't RSVP or return our check-in messages you will be booted. Kink will always be here and so will we. Sometimes its just not the right time to start something new and we totally get that! For that reason and many others everyone is free to rejoin at anytime.<\/p>\n<p>follow us on facebook - Boston Munch<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/0\/9\/highres_446888201.jpeg","photo_id":446888201,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/0\/9\/600_446888201.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/0\/9\/thumb_446888201.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":124880012,"name":"MK","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/3\/7\/highres_255083095.jpeg","photo_id":255083095,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/3\/7\/member_255083095.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/3\/7\/thumb_255083095.jpeg"}},"members":39,"name":"(Active) Boston Munch - Fetish Kink BDSM Poly","id":19046453,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonMunch","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Kinksters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445430904000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"internet-of-things","name":"Internet of Things","id":79740},{"urlkey":"automation","name":"Automation","id":93380},{"urlkey":"iot","name":"IoT","id":1505112},{"urlkey":"industrial-internet-of-things","name":"Industrial Internet of Things","id":1505320},{"urlkey":"ge-digital","name":"GE Digital","id":1508654},{"urlkey":"asset-performance-management","name":"Asset Performance Management","id":1508656},{"urlkey":"predix","name":"Predix","id":1508657}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Industrial-Internet-of-Things\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>The Industrial Internet changes the game for industrial companies.

We are looking for folks interested in playing technical, small-sided games that we hold in Dorchester\/Boston. We play year round. During winter, we play futsal indoors. During warmer months, we play small-sided games outdoors, ranging from street\/court surfaces to small-sided turf pitches. We've started this group because we'd like to have more people join the regular games that we host, and we hope to meet some folks that will \"get\" the club and might be interested in staying involved (no pressure though). In general, our games prioritize skill, strategy, and team play over physical brutality and aggression. Indoors, we typically play 4 v 4 with small goals, no keepers, and an official futsal ball on a basketball court. Outdoors, we most often play 4 v 4 (or 5 v 5) on a small-sided turf field with a size 5 ball; sometimes we also will play a street game on a street hockey rink with a street\/futsal ball. ABOUT UPSETTERS FC: We are a diverse club based in Dorchester, focused on technical, small-sided games. We are a real club, with a family feel, an interest in design and community, and an appreciation for reggae music. We hold several regular club events (tournaments, parties, trips, etc.) and try and keep things interesting by playing friendlies with like-minded clubs. Sometimes we play in leagues, but often we find we enjoy playing and training together more than league play (and we've been successful in leagues). The focus of our sessions is overwhelmingly on \"open\" play, but we sometimes integrate games that feature a tactical\/team component. Our vibe is laid back and friendly, but we appreciate a good game, particularly one that flows well and features lots of movement of the ball and players. We have good players, and are looking for more, but more so we are looking for good people who will appreciate our weekly game and our club. We like dope uniforms and gear. Men and women are welcome; this probably isn't the best environment for real novices, but we welcome those \"returning\" to the game and those that have recently fallen in love with it. We don't tolerate ultra-competitive BS and those that mess up the vibe we've worked hard to create over the years.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194595716,"name":"hureauinho","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/highres_250858559.jpeg","photo_id":250858559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/member_250858559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/thumb_250858559.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Dorchester Small-Sided Soccer & Futsal","id":19061291,"state":"MA","urlname":"Dorchester-Small-Sided-Soccer-Futsal","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445841239000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"angel-investors","name":"Angel Investors","id":29000},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"artificial-intelligence-applications","name":"Artificial Intelligence Applications","id":90163},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"biotechnology","name":"Biotechnology","id":109595},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"web-application-security","name":"Web Application Security","id":161342}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonInternetStartups\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Chapter of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pro\/GlobalInternetStartups\/\">Global Internet Startups <\/a>Meetup group, Boston Internet Startups (<b>BOIS<\/b>) was founded in October 2015 and it is one of the fastest growing startup communities in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Our events empower entrepreneurs by connecting people and creating opportunities for companies to develop new businesses, meet customers, launch new products, promote their brands and expand their markets.<\/p>\n<p><b>BOIS<\/b> strives to help: Entrepreneurs, Students, Techies, Startups, Investors, Mentors and Advisors.<\/p>\n<p>This group will: Host great events, get you involved, connect people and help you take action.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Join, Participate and Enjoy! \u263a<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.iias-iisa.org\/egpa\/wp-content\/uploads\/Boston-skyline.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p>Home to some of USA's hottest startups, <b>Boston<\/b> is an emerging force in the world of innovation.

People who have less experience in IT can benefit from the knowledge of technologists because they are finding challenges with the support they need. Technologists can benefit from meeting with people outside of the workplace so they can share their knowledge and converse without having to take their work home, impress someone or delve deeply into what makes them tick. Bringing them together to meet and learn from each other is the purpose of this group.<\/p>\n<p>My experience is broad and multivariate. I've had numerous opportunities to provide emotional support to others while, engaging them with my knowledge of computers and technology, providing them with a means to advance their careers while, providing me with the opportunity to be creative. This group represents an opportunity for me to engineer a space where technologists can bring together their knowledge with others as I have while, connecting and becoming more creative themselves.<\/p>\n<p>My plan is to have meetings every other week in a casual coffee shop environment where people feel comfortable speaking openly about subjects of their interest which may or may not be highly technical. In some respects this group is experimental but in others I may find a way to structure conversations with certain rules so the experience is more practical and less free-form. I am a professionally trained facilitator with a diverse background in engineering beginning with undergraduate and graduate work and extending into vocations that include instruction and innovation.

Meeting up for dinner one or two nights a week and trying different restaurants (Bukhara, Acapulcos, city feed) and others that are here. We could also maybe meet up once a week for trivia night at one of the bars or try a different bar once a week. As the group gets to know each other we could do pot luck dinners, movie nights and whatever else we fancy. We can even play tennis or shoot hoops.

The initiative explores how emerging technologies will advance the practice of medicine, improve health, and empower patients to be active participants in their own care. Such emerging technologies include those that are: largely digital (e.g., online peer-to-peer healthcare communities, wearables); \u2022 methodological (e.g., human-centered design and innovation, service design); \u2022 cultural (e.g., participatory medicine, doctors and patients functioning as designers); \u2022 and more.

The group will offer opportunities to hear from key members of these communities, experience emerging technologies, collaborate on projects, and more.

Gabriel Baldwin, group founder, has been working with clients since 2014 after his personal journey of letting go of stuff enabled him to majorly downsize his housing situation, move on from a 'good' job that wasn't serving him to pursue his passions while having a blast along the way.","lon":-71.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14391765,"name":"Gabriel Baldwin","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/highres_251138987.jpeg","photo_id":251138987,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/member_251138987.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/thumb_251138987.jpeg"}},"members":183,"name":"Less Stuff, More Joy - Boston","id":19092819,"state":"MA","urlname":"LessStuffMoreJoyBoston","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Simplifiers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brighton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446739264000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"fun-singles","name":"Fun Singles","id":20103},{"urlkey":"fun-singles-friends","name":"Fun Singles & Friends","id":20108},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-singles-singles","name":"Singles, Singles, Singles","id":115707},{"urlkey":"single-adventurers","name":"Single adventurers","id":156403},{"urlkey":"singles-group-singles-30s-and-over","name":"Singles group; Singles 30s and over;","id":625622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Singles-Life-Journey\/","rating":5,"description":"<p> Welcome to the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Singles-Life-Journey\/\">Single's Life Journey<\/a>&nbsp;<span>\u2013 A Higher Love Singles Group\u201d This is not your average Singles group.

The idea is that us parents stay nearby while the kids have fun together for an hour or so at different locations each week or so, and we give them a break....from us.

Looking forward to making lasting friendships for us and the little ones :) The $ dues will go to the monthly meetup organizer cost. About the organizer: I recently moved to the North Shore and after previously meeting the most amazing friends on a baby meet-up group. What started as playdates at library programs turned into Holiday Parties, themed playdates, and more then our share of Mimosas :) Having a good group of mom friends can certainly break up the monotony that often takes the lead with little ones.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" &nbsp;- Buckminster Fuller<\/i><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Town Hall is an old New England tradition<\/b>&nbsp;going back four centuries, that involved true democratic participation of all citizens in their community's social and political decisions. &nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>In &nbsp;the 21st century in Newton Massachusetts we do not have a system of democratic participation. Newton politics is run by an insular political clique who do not truly welcome citizen participation. They view any citizens who attempt to participate in the political process as a nuisance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The politicians will perform a pantomime of allowing citizen participation, but it's just a sham, and they will end up doing whatever they intended to do all along, after they finish their charade or pretending to listen to feedback from the public.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Newton's politicians do not care what is best for the community, and they certainly don't care what any of the citizens think about anything. What they care about is their own positions of power, the business dealings that are at the root of all their decisions, and the status symbols of their titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you've ever attempted to get involved in Newton politics at any level you will probably recognize the truth of the above paragraph. You may also have come to the realization of the futility of expecting to ever be able to change the way things are run in Newton politics.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>The idea of <b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;is to start from scratch, to scrap the established way of running decisions, and try to envision what a truly democratic and reasonable form of local government would be. This must be a form of interaction where everyone has the right to be heard, and truly listened to, and where decisions are based on reason, sense, logic, and commitment to what is genuinely best for the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The manners of behavior and procedure that are conducted by the current political system must be discarded, because these behaviors and procedures clearly do not work in favor of the goals of true democracy. These behaviors are designed only to maintain the power dynamics of the politicians, to keep them powerful and you powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To begin with, then, we must dispense with the insincere behaviors of handshaking, gavel-wielding, and applause.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>NewTown Hall<\/b>&nbsp;must create a model of how local government <i>ought<\/i>&nbsp;to be conducted. We will develop this on our own, as ordinary citizens, without the participation of the politicians.

Once your servers are installed with Stacki, you can augment them with configuration tools like Puppet, Chef, Salt, CFEngine, Ansible, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join the Stacki community:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?utm_campaign=Stacki%20Meetups&amp;utm_source=Meetups#!forum\/stacki\">https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/stacki<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Download Stacki:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.stacki.com\/?utm_campaign=Stacki%20Meetups&amp;utm_source=Meetups\">http:\/\/www.stacki.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Stacki documentation:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/StackIQ\/stacki\/wiki?utm_campaign=Stacki%20Meetups&amp;utm_source=Meetups\">https:\/\/github.com\/StackIQ\/stacki\/wiki<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow Stacki on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Stacki?utm_campaign=Stacki%20Meetups&amp;utm_source=Meetups\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/Stacki<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/stacki\" class=\"linkified\"><\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/d\/highres_447181261.jpeg","photo_id":447181261,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/d\/600_447181261.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/d\/thumb_447181261.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196020351,"name":"Colleen Harig","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/highres_251655689.jpeg","photo_id":251655689,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/member_251655689.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/thumb_251655689.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Stacki Boston","id":19173259,"state":"MA","urlname":"StackiLab-Boston","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Stackiens"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Quincy","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449014343000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"masterminds","name":"MasterMinds","id":15392},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"influence","name":"Influence","id":19483},{"urlkey":"leadership-development","name":"Leadership Development","id":19539},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"personal-growth-development","name":"Personal Growth & Development","id":21726},{"urlkey":"personal-self-growth-empowerment","name":"Personal Self Growth & Empowerment","id":27503},{"urlkey":"masterminding","name":"Masterminding","id":59780},{"urlkey":"intentional-masterminds","name":"Intentional Masterminds","id":67954},{"urlkey":"john-c-maxwell","name":"John C.

Have you ever felt happiness in your life... ...never lasts? This Buddhist group has a great positive, multi-cultural atmosphere that helps people search for the answer to life's biggest questions. Through the teachings of Buddha and historical Pure Land Buddhist teachers we understand better the direction our life needs to take in order to find the purpose of life. We offer video lectures and have meetings to discuss how to obtain an absolute form of happiness. I hope you'll stop by and attend a meeting when you have a chance! Below, you'll find some more information about what Buddhism is all about as well as our contact info and location. In Buddhism, we learn that there are two kinds of joy. Relative Happiness All the happiness we know is called Relative Happiness. Money, status, fame, wealth, family, friends, and our loved ones are all included in this category. Politics, economics, medicine, and the arts also try to provide us with Relative happiness. We seek for this type of happiness day in, day out hoping we can attain true satisfaction from it. Absolute Happiness We are all seeking for a happiness which will truly last. This kind of happiness is called Absolute Happiness. The purpose of life is to attain it as quickly as possible while still alive.

However, this won't be a traditional sitting based meditation group as the focus would be to find ways to bringing in mindfulness in our daily lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Announcement of location will be made a week in advance. Initial meeting sessions, for meditations and dialogues, will be guided by Chris Mayya, who spent several years in monasteries of different traditions and has a background of growing up and training both in the East and the west.

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in Boston. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have.

Long live hardware!<\/p>\n<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.<\/p>\n<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.<\/p>\n<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the \"onesy\" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or \"dumb\" cars?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being \"merely\" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors.

It is the opportunity for believers and non believers to get together and share their philosophical views on existentialism, share their struggles in the defiance towards status quo or peer influence, and find happiness through open mindedness, volunteer work and other sorts of humanism. I developed a philosophical posture in life called Igocentrism. Science has shown us how the three main sources of happiness are the so called Intrinsic Sources: self growth, relationships and the giving to others. However, society is negatively impacted by the pursuit of the so called Extrinsic Sources: money, status, and physical appearance. I believe this unrelenting idolatry towards the feeding of one self leads to ego-centrism, so I figured an appropriate antonym should name this new-founded ideology. Igocentrism also focuses on the liberation from religious belief, as in the societal definition of \"religion\". It is a deist approach to the existence of God - not necessarily atheist and yet open to the possibility of a non intellectual creator - which commends a utilitarian morality over an epistemological religious morality based on scripture. This group is intended for people who would like to learn more about igocentrism and hopefully find bliss in what could very possibly be the only finite life we have in this world.<\/p>","lon":-71.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/highres_445470094.jpeg","photo_id":445470094,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/600_445470094.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/thumb_445470094.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197384954,"name":"Ricardo Martins","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/highres_252416562.jpeg","photo_id":252416562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/member_252416562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/thumb_252416562.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"I.G.O Society of Free Thinkers","id":19250158,"state":"MA","urlname":"I-G-O-Society-of-Igocentric-Free-Thinkers","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.2400016785,"who":"Igomaniacs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451425174000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"charity-work","name":"Charity Work","id":16453},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"charity","name":"Charity","id":25598},{"urlkey":"cancer-support-group","name":"Cancer Support Group","id":33425},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Young-Professionals-Group-The-Lemon-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"The Lemon Society of Boston is a young professionals group which allows members to network with other like-minded professionals, build leadership skills and contribute to a worthy cause all while having a great time!

Increasingly studies are attesting to the powerful effects sound vibration has on our physical and emotional well-being. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mantra, which means \u201cthat which saves the mind\u201d or \u201cinstruments of the mind\u201d, is a collection of mathematically precise and melodic Sanskrit sound vibrations designed for specific energetic intentions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the Maha Mantra called the \u201cgreat\u201d Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This specific Mantra deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for two reasons: 1) it is one of very few mantras that combines both the feminine and masculine divinities simultaneously. 2) It can be chanted at any time and place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the origin of the Maha Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Mantra is found in the Kali-santara Upanishad, one of the 108 principle Upanishads, and was given by Brahma to the sage Narada.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the benefits of Japa Meditation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because the Maha Mantra combines both the feminine and masculine it is a Bhakti mantra or \u201cmantra of loving relationships\u201d. This works on transforming and improving the practitioner\u2019s ability to have relationships on three levels - 1) Personal (relationship with oneself); 2) Interpersonal (relationships with others); and 3) Spiritual (relationship with the divine). <\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Japa Circles?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles provide a powerful space in which the simultaneous recitation by all members amplifies the energy of the mantra exponentially. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What takes place at a Japa Circle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 5 minutes the practitioner performs preparatory&nbsp;breathing and mindfulness exercises. For 20 minutes the actual Japa meditation takes place. Practitioners recite the mantra softly in rhythm and cadence with the instructor with increasing relaxation and concentration. The final 5 minutes is used for the concluding breathing exercises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of the various levels?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Maha Mantra was handed down with a recommendation that the practitioner recite the mantra 35 million times! The various levels are designed to give us impetus and inspiration. However, in the more mature stages of our personal development these levels become superfluous as the joy and transformation awakened by our Japa meditation becomes its own reward. <\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/highres_447295668.jpeg","photo_id":447295668,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/600_447295668.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/thumb_447295668.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120115562,"name":"Maha Visnu Gray","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/highres_158975632.jpeg","photo_id":158975632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/member_158975632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/thumb_158975632.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"Japa (Mantra Meditation) Classes -

If you are looking to expand your social circle, make new friends with similar interests and embrace all that this area has to offer then this is the group for you! Will plan events such as dinners, concerts, museums, theatre, wine tastings, spa days, cooking classes, afternoon teas, sporting events, day trips, 5k runs, casual weekend brunches, monthly movie nights at local theaters, etc. and even a book club. &nbsp;Events will take place in the city and the metro area. &nbsp;Suggestions are welcome!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>General Housekeeping Items:<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br> <br><span>-RSVP: please keep this up to date as much as possible. Understand we all get busy &amp; must changes plans time to time, but the group is quite large...want to make certain space for those that can attend. Also as with most groups, no shows are not unacceptable and will be removed from the group. &nbsp;Also try to only RSVP if you think you will be able to attend. Much appreciated!&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <br> <br> <br><span>-Group size: there's been loads of interest in the group, but I'm going to try to keep it at 110. I'm always more the merrier however several of the events are \"wait lists\" and want to be fair to current members. Also to make sure each of you get to attend events. Where I can, such as museums, etc. those will not have limits.&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <br> <br> <br><span>-Attendance: received comments as to why I've limited events, there are several reasons. Mostly due to the restaurants &amp; group size they will take. 12-15 tends to be the maximum. Also if the groups are too large it's hard to know one another. Ask that you only attend if you are on the \"yes\" list. Some of the venues are pretty strict!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <br> <br> <br><span>Book club: excited there is so much interest. Ideally this will be an standard group of around 20 of us &amp; we'll rotate hosting at our homes, parks, the beach, etc. This is what I had set up for my club in NY &amp; it was fabulous! At some point it will not be a \"Meetup\" event but rather just the book club. I really do not like holding them in restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <br> <br> <br><span>-Profiles: understand we all want &amp; need to protect our privacy. I've done the best to keep our group as \"private\" as possible. Do ask however that your profile include a photo of you &amp; your name...this way we can all recognize you when attending events.

Past participants have ranged from the curious beginner to widely published authors. The format began in El Paso Texas over 20 years ago when poet Donna Snyder formed the Tumblewords Writers Project. A presenter delivers a 5-10 minute experience designed to inspire a written response in any form. Participants write for 10-15 minutes then each person reads the unfiltered writing out loud. There is no critique. There is no editing. There is 100% acceptance of the \"in the moment efforts\" of each participant. Each particiant leaves with a set of inspirations which they can process and refine outside of the workshop. Each session lasts 2 hours and there are usually 2 - 4 opportunities to respond, write and read out loud. We currently meet at the Marblehead Library.","lon":-70.9000015259,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138612772,"name":"Michele","photo":{"photo_id":194891742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/d\/e\/member_194891742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/d\/e\/thumb_194891742.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"Tumblewords East : A Northshore Creative Writing Meetup","id":19283861,"state":"MA","urlname":"Tumblewords-East-A-Northshore-Creative-Writing-Meetup","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Poets and writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wakefield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452022811000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"acappella","name":"A Cappella","id":1480},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"choir","name":"Choir","id":48306},{"urlkey":"group-singing","name":"Group Singing","id":54268},{"urlkey":"singing-sacred-choral-music","name":"Singing sacred choral music","id":860072},{"urlkey":"chorus","name":"chorus","id":974852},{"urlkey":"choral-group","name":"choral group","id":974862},{"urlkey":"satb-choral-ensemble","name":"SATB choral ensemble","id":986942},{"urlkey":"choral-singers","name":"Choral Singers","id":1394312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wakefield-Choral-Society\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Start the New Year on a high note!
