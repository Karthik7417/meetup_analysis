This event is open to the public and shouldn\u2019t be missed!<\/p> <p>FRANK DAYKIN, PIANIST, is equally known as soloist, collaborative pianist, teacher, writer, and musicologist. His \u201cThe Encyclopedia of French Art Song: Faur\u00e9, Debussy, Ravel, Poulenc\u201d was published (Pendragon Press, May 2013), and has been acquired by over 235 institutions of musical higher learning thus far. In it, he shares the wealth of his forty-plus years as a vocal coach and recital partner. Daykin was fortunate to have lived in the time of Bernac, Souzay, and Ameling, often accompanying their master classes in the US and abroad. For some years, he was the assistant of Thomas Grubb, the renowned French song expert, in all his classes at the Manhattan School of Music, working with over 60 singers weekly. Daykin writes a bi-weekly arts blog; and he is a classical reviewer for the New York Concert Review. Daykin has also had three volumes of poetry published, numerous<br\/>\u200bselections having been set to music by contemporary composers. \u201cQuestions Remain: New Poems 2012\/2013\u201d (2014, CreateSpace), \u201cWords Without Songs\u201d (1992, Silver Hill Press), and \u201cIslands\u201d (1991, Silver Hill Press). Daykin is particularly identified with the French piano and chamber music repertoire, having performed the complete solo piano works of Ravel on Ravel\u2019s own piano at the Ravel house\/museum in France. His 35-year partnership with Millette Alexander in piano duo performance has produced two award-winning recordings and a host of performances in the US and abroad, always to rave reviews. He continues with numerous chamber groups including the Adelphi Chamber Players, Ambrosia Trio and Gotham Trio. Currently, he is on the faculty of the Chamber Music Conference\/Composers Forum of the East at Bennington, VT. Decades of teaching experience have given him a fund of information that is always faithful to the music, while adding elements of humor and a supportive atmosphere that encourage learning. His master classes, in particular, often involve the spectators almost as much as the players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Rehearsal Hall - 7th Floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Art-Song-Preservation-Society-of-NY\/events\/230093090\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Frank Daykin's Debussy, Faur\u00e9, Ravel & Poulenc Master Class","id":"230093090","time":1463245200000,"updated":1463269780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1241577160000,"name":"The Art Song Preservation Society of NY","group_lon":-74,"id":1451147,"urlname":"The-Art-Song-Preservation-Society-of-NY","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Art Song Recitalists\/Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"260 West 36th Street 3rd Floor ","name":"36 Street Studio","lon":-73.991936,"id":15351712,"state":"NY","lat":40.753147,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.24035641551,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459559971000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey everyone,<\/p> <p>My friend Noelle, owner of the meetup group \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ReadersandShakers\/events\/229718812\/\">Readers and Shakers NYC<\/a>\" is having a book swap and because I love a good swap, I thought it would be a great event for us to go to.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality.

Shamanism is the earliest spiritual practice known to humankind. It is a universal practice. that has been and is still practiced all over the world.<br\/>In this workshop Danielle Wilkinson will lead you on your own personal shamanic journey. The shamanic journey is a core practice in all shamanic cultures. Shamanic journeying is a ritual performed to help us improve our own health and well-being. Journeying and other Shamanic practices introduce us to ways of living a more conscious life. These rituals also give us a foundation of how to be in service to the planet.<br\/>Shamans use monotonous sounds to alter consciousness during journeying. This ritual is typically done with some form of percussion: drumming &amp; rattling. Scientific research shows us that when we are in an ordinary state of consciousness, our brainwaves are what are called in a beta state. When we listen to the sounds of drums, rattles, whistling sticks, didgeridoo, click sticks, chanting, bowls, etc. our brainwaves start to slow down out of an ordinary state of consciousness. Our brainwaves first go into what's called an alpha state. As we continue the journey, our brainwaves slow down even more and we go into a theta state. The theta state is where the shaman and the participant in the journey has access into something we call the invisible realms.<br\/>Some people call the invisible realms non-ordinary reality. In these realms we have access to helping spirits, messages and information and methods of healing for ourselves, humanity and our planet. We are all connected by an invisible web. Any form of healing we partake in in turn assists in healing the collective.<br\/>Danielle Wilkinson will guide you as you embark on this beautiful journey of freedom and peace through guided meditation and shamanic journey. You will be guided to meet your Power Animal helping spirit. Your Power Animal will lead the way on the rest of your journey to healing. This is a very powerful experience that will help transform your life and guide you to a path to inner transformation.<br\/>We will end with 30 mins of Crystal Chakra Sound Bowls by Brenda Castano.<br\/>Requirements: bring a journal or paper and pen<\/p> <p>$30 Cash or pay in advance PayPal: [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Welcome-Ohm-Wellness-Center\/events\/230322339\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Journey for Healing with Sound","id":"230322339","time":1463248800000,"updated":1463257158000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1438086763000,"name":"Welcome Ohm Wellness Center","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":18779200,"urlname":"Welcome-Ohm-Wellness-Center","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"231 W 29th St. #603","name":"ReadyWork","lon":-73.994232,"id":23934552,"state":"NY","lat":40.748657,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":0.240856200457,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461530779000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Last topic: criticism.<b> Next Topic: Common Mistakes.<\/b><\/p> <p>We will continue with <b>\"What's Your Project?\"<\/b>\u00a0by exploring <i>common mistakes <\/i>while finding ways to improve our writing and finish our projects.

This month we'll be discussing <i>All the Birds in the Sky<\/i> by Charlie Jane Anders:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>From the editor-in-chief of io9.com, a stunning novel about the end of the world--and the beginning of our future<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Childhood friends Patricia Delfine and Laurence Armstead didn't expect to see each other again, after parting ways under mysterious circumstances during middle school. After all, the development of magical powers and the invention of a two-second time machine could hardly fail to alarm one's peers and families.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>But now they're both adults, living in the hipster mecca San Francisco, and the planet is falling apart around them. Laurence is an engineering genius who's working with a group that aims to avert catastrophic breakdown through technological intervention. Patricia is a graduate of Eltisley Maze, the hidden academy for the world's magically gifted, and works with a small band of other magicians to secretly repair the world's every-growing ailments. Little do they realize that something bigger than either of them, something begun years ago in their youth, is determined to bring them together--to either save the world, or plunge it into a new dark ages.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>A deeply magical, darkly funny examination of life, love, and the apocalypse.<\/i><\/p> <p>Sadly I will be unable to run the event. Becky Spurr will take over hosting duties for this session. You will also be picking a classic genre novel for our next read.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're the nerds in the back.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror\/events\/230634517\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Book Club: All The Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders","id":"230634517","time":1463248800000,"updated":1463261125000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402509345000,"name":"Genre Book Club (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":15026732,"urlname":"Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462856653000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tibetan Lama Pai kung fu is an uncharacteristic martial art akin to standard Shaolin martial arts.

In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone's eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<\/p> <p>The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert's writing, which islucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny. The immensely readable <a href=\"http:\/\/www.randomhouse.com\/kvpa\/gilbert\/\">Stumbling on Happiness<\/a>, published in 2006, became a New York Times bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<\/p> <p>In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life.

Let's talk and \"give\" ;) numerous examples exploring how we have given (looking back) in addition to how we continue to give our time, money\/physical resources, intangible resources, mind\/focus\/attention, heart\/spirit\/affection, respect, dedication, (any noun), and the list goes on and on...Later in the conversation or over dinner, we'll discuss how we might give to others and ourselves differently, so as to ultimately increase our collective value and experience of life.<\/p> <p>The concept of \"Giving\" is quite vast and has many levels to it so I greatly look forward to discussing with all of you. Any and all thoughts are welcome on the subject beyond the simple description above.<\/p> <p>Note: this is not a support group for those sad or depressed as there are other domains set up for that purpose. Please do not attend if you feel or rationalize that others somehow have the responsibility of cheering you up, directly or indirectly.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/events\/219754221\/\">A Conversation About Happiness<\/a><\/p> <p>Alternating Hosts: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/3373400\/\">George<\/a>, Priyo, &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/142605152\/\">Michael Y<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/3373400\/\">&lt;\/a&gt; CitiCorp Atrium Lower Level<br\/>153 E 53rd street (Between Lexington and 3rd ave)<\/a><\/p> <p>Look for our red Meetup Sign.<\/p> <p>The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6.

Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br\/>$24\u00a0 - PAY IN ADVANCE ONLY - WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR LAST MINUTE\/DAY OF CANCELLATIONS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>All ATWYS members who pay in advance for this event will receive a promo code for $7 off other select events from our calendar (wine tastings, boat cruises, speeddating, advanced degree events, fireman parties.) Please be sure to check your eventbrite order confirmation for the promo codes to use to redeem your discount.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:<\/b><\/p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events. All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.<\/p> <p><br\/>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

It's amazes me the requests I'm getting to continue hosting more and more of these events, and honestly, I see great things in our future that will come out from these events! The purpose for this event is to create connections between different student leaders in the north Jersey area. Think of this event as a similar networking event the SGA or the office Student Life hosts in your university. The difference between this event and the networking event in your university is that we'll have different student leaders from different universities at this event. This event will be ran in an unconference style. Overall, what this means is that we will have discussion based sessions where you guys (Student Leaders) will bring the topics you would like to talk about, and we'll all give our opinions, suggestions, and comments on the topic. Sample topics would be the following:<\/p> <p>1. How to publicize for an event<\/p> <p>2. How to recruit new members<\/p> <p>3. How to deal with a lazy Eboard member<\/p> <p>4. How to effectively train new eboard members Get me? In the education field, they have these unconference events where different educators come together to gain and share knowledge about any topics regarding education; they are called edcamps. We are essentially using that same model, but we'll focus on topics that relate to student-ran organizations. Check out the video below to get an idea of what an unconference event looks like.

This marks the start of the European stretch on the race calendar.<\/p> <p><b>Championship Standing:<\/b>\u00a0Nico Rosberg who is perfect thus far is leading the Drivers Championship on four wins with 100 points. His teammate Lewis Hamilton is second with 57 points, followed by Kimi Raikkonen with 43 points.\u00a0On the Constructor front, Mercedes leads with 157 points, followed by Ferrari and Red Bull with 76 and 57 points respectively.<\/p> <p><b>The Track:<\/b> It is said that a car that does well at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya will do well for the rest of the season. The 4.655 km long track has 16 corners including\u00a0a 1 km long main straight that represents the best shot at overtaking, with top speeds exceeding 330 kph. The track is a mix of medium to fast corners in the first and second sectors, and slow corners in the third.\u00a0Having a good down force package is key but one also needs some straight line speed to overtake and good traction for the last sector. The constantly changing wind direction makes the car set up and driving all the more challenging for the teams.<\/p> <p><b>DRS Zones:<\/b>\u00a0There will be two DRS zones. The first is on the main straight, with a detection point right after the Turn 14-15 chicane. The second is on the shorter back straight between turn 9 and 10, with detection point right before turn 9.<\/p> <p><b>Tire Allocation:<\/b> The fast corners, especially the long turn 3, and the abrasive asphalt make the track one of the most punishing of the entire season for the tires. The Hard (Orange), Medium (White) and Soft (Yellow) compounds will be available throughout the weekend. The most likely tire strategy will be 2 or 3 pit stops.<\/p> <p><b>Talking points: <\/b>Will Nico Rosberg continue his perfect season with his fifth win? Or will Lewis Hamilton finally get his first win of the year? Can Ferrari turn around their misfortune and secure a victory? Can Haas F1 once again have a strong race with a handful of points? Has McLaren Honda finally found the speed to compete with the top teams?<\/p> <p>Race will start at\u00a0<b>08:00 AM EDT<\/b>\u00a0with the pre-race starting at\u00a0<b>07:30 AM EDT<\/b>.

The novelty of Stride lies in its programming interaction design: Halfway between block-based languages (such as Scratch or Alice) and text-based programming, it provides a great stepping stone from one into the other.

With the roll out of the CS For All initiative in NYC schools, teachers can and should look for engaging ways to collaborate, integrate and create new learning experiences for themselves and their students using CS and their content. As an English and Theatre Arts teacher, Meredith found a natural connection between Scratch and Theatre Arts, specifically Directing skills. Capitalizing on the work the 9th graders do in their CS courses at AFSE, Meredith created an interdisciplinary unit- Partner Scenes, Directing and Scratch. This presentation will cover the development process, final unit and materials, and student work samples.<\/p> <p><br\/>Meredith is a teacher at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afsenyc.org\">Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE).<\/a><\/p> <p><b>&gt; Tanner Welsh:\u00a0Test-driven Creativity<\/b><\/p> <p>In the world of professional software development, test-driven development (TDD) is a popular methodology for writing code using short development cycles with frequent feedback. The core procedure of TDD is simple: write a failing test, write code to make it pass, and then improve your code. In this workshop, participants will learn about TDD and explore both simple and creative ways that it can be applied in a classroom environment.\u00a0The possible applications are many: as an assessment tool, as a means of encouraging good problem-solving habits, and as a language for expressing clear outcomes.

Giving personalized feedback can be challenging and enormously time-consuming, especially when teaching large numbers of students, but setting clear learning targets and using technology can make this process more efficient and effective.In this\u00a0<i>BYO<\/i>-laptop workshop, we will work with spreadsheets, Python code, and YouTube to practice strategies for giving students useful, personalized feedback without spending an entire weekend grading. When assessing clear standards for assignments, spreadsheet data can be easily translated into personalized paragraphs of feedback for students by using a simple Python script. This feedback can then direct students to online videos that support their learning, or translated into a letter grade in a traditional gradebook.\u00a0All tech-levels are welcome, but participants must bring a personal laptop.

We also commit ourselves to future generations by promoting a reverence for life and finding relevance for ethical values. We will be joined by members of other Ethical Societies in a morning of music, words and movement.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.rysec.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/felix-adler-lays-the-cornerstone-for-the-new-york-society-for-ethical-culture-300x225.jpg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Visit www.rysec.org\/directions","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Riverdale-Yonkers-Ethical-Culture-Society\/events\/230685448\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Founder\u2019s Day: Celebrating 140 Years of Ethical Living","id":"dwmdglyvhbtb","time":1463324400000,"updated":1463330977000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1378390180000,"name":"Riverdale Yonkers Ethical Culture Society","group_lon":-73.9100036621,"id":10120142,"urlname":"Riverdale-Yonkers-Ethical-Culture-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07604","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hasbrouck Heights","address_1":"Burton Ave & Washington Place","lon":-74.073432,"phone":"201-298-3314","name":"First Reformed Church","id":10997222,"state":"NJ","lat":40.862304,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.92015075684,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454374805000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet at 300 Washington Place (Burton Ave &amp; Washington) in Hasbrouck Heights, NJ 07604. \u00a0You can call (201)[masked] for more information or email [masked].<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/4\/8\/600_433964616.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/crossconnectionnj\/events\/230991329\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":695700000,"name":"Join us Sunday morning!","id":"hsqwplyvhbtb","time":1463324400000,"updated":1464021659000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357431264000,"name":"Cross Connection North Jersey","group_lon":-74.0800018311,"id":6506772,"urlname":"crossconnectionnj","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":9.74920272827,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460653163000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us as we participate in Teaneck Creek Conservancy\u2019s annual Spring Fest.

It might be the scariest place you have ever been to in your life.<br\/>I was reminded of traveling to this place by my friends.<br\/>There are tunnels located at the top of Clausland Mountain in Orangeburg.\u00a0<\/p> <p>My friend took me there about four years ago and he will guide us up there again.<br\/>He said the tunnels were originally built as an army base during WWI in case of invasion. They were also used for drills and training. There are miles of tunnels throughout the mountain. Visible concrete walls run through the woods. Each tunnel also has another tunnel under it. There are many secret caverns and rooms throughout the passageways. There are also bomb shelter rooms and rooms under rooms called hell holes.<\/p> <p>\n\nMy friend also told me of a other stories that he will share that day. He is a Police officer for the State Police and he will be our Guide on this Adventure.<\/p> <p>\n\nSo sprawled over 321 acres of Blauvelt State Park on the slopes of Clausland Mountain lies the ruins of a pre-World War One rifle range known as Camp Bluefields. Now totally abandoned, these \"army tunnels\" and the surrounding area were once a buzzing hive of activity eighty years ago.<\/p> <p><br\/>In 1910 the New York National Guard built the range to replace Creedmoor, its old range on Long Island. However, the marksmen imported from Long Island and other parts of the Metropolitan area were not happy with the range. They claimed that the layout of the range necessitated shooting with the sun in one's eyes, and that Blauvelt was simply too inaccessible. (After all, twenty-two miles was quite a ride in those days). Soon after the range was opened it became evident that the weekend warriors were not the only ones who had gripes about Camp Bluefields. Irate citizens of South Nyack found that their southern neighbors were spewing a hail of lead upon them. Bullets for this range (built on high ground as it was) often overshot their targets, raining down upon the unhappy citizenry and causing quite a furor. By June of 1912, sufficient numbers of houses had been pierced by the errant missiles to cause the Guard to cease operation.<\/p> <p>The embarrassed New York Guard gave this tract of land to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, after only three years of use... This white elephant was last used during World War Two, when soldiers from nearby Camp Shanks used it for training. Since then, Camp Bluefields has been left alone to the dual ravages of time and the elements. Rumors about the range being cursed and haunted have abounded, which is not surprising considering its isolated location and state of disrepair.<\/p> <p><br\/>Many times he has seen much satanic evidence such as fire rings. Most people say the whole place is haunted.\u00a0<\/p> <p>On the brighter side, its a facination place, if you visit the tunnels, there is much great graffiti from crews like NVSP, and ABK. Other local writers such as Domain and Rook also have pieces of art there.<\/p> <p>\n\n45 min Ride each way-<\/p> <p><br\/>Shuttle Bus will \u00a0take us there and back<\/p> <p>(Round Trip Transportation Tour\u00a0Guide for)\u00a0<\/p> <p>For $23.00 pp\u00a0<\/p> <p>Its an easy walk, 3.5 miles Round trip w Minimal Elevations Changes\u00a0<\/p> <p>We need a guide because maps are not accurate w GPS<\/p> <p>You should bring Water, Camera, \u00a0cells phones, Comforting walking shoes and flashlights-\u00a0<\/p> <p>Questions?

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

She has a gift for sharing how to receive, trust, and live by guidance, and you will feel it when you are in her shining, peaceful presence.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/6\/d\/600_449272077.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Frances grew up in Beijing in an atheist, achievement-driven family. As an adult she moved to Australia where she worked for an investment firm and married. But she felt a strong call to explore spirituality and meditation, which led her in 2007 to\u00a0A Course in Miracles. She found it difficult to understand at first, but it elicited in her\u00a0a strong prompt to quit her job and start her own business to giver herself more freedom to explore \u2014 and she did. The very next day she walked into a library and picked up\u00a0A Course in Miracles\u00a0again and this time she felt it pouring into her like music, so much easier to understand and receive.<\/p> <p><br\/>She met David Hoffmeister in 2009, and attended one of his retreats in Australia in 2010. One of his companions asked her, \u201cWhat do you want, Frances?\u201d She answered, \u201cI want to fly with you guys, metaphorically and physically.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d \u201cI have a husband. I have a business, and I have a house.\u201d \u2013 \u2026..\u201cWhat do you think you need to do?\u201d \u201cLet them go. If any of the things in my life will not support my calling, it\u2019s time to let them go.\u201d She moved to one of David\u2019s communities to continue to study and eventually began traveling with David Hoffmeister and on her own, going wherever called to teach and demonstrate how to follow the Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance with no compromise.<\/p> <p>Following Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance is a practice of letting go of the \u201cI know\u201d mind as well as the illusory personal will and preference. With deep honesty and steadfast application without exception, the self that thinks it has any control and any existence is seen as an illusion. The seeking has ended and the Mind is still. Every part of her being is in complete cooperation with the flow of life. A deep sense of harmony and peace is present. The Love that is beyond this world is shining through. Frances follows the Inspiration and joyfully goes where she is meant to be. The message of Truth pours through her and offers clarity and insight into the inner workings of the road less traveled and a life lived in divine providence.<\/p> <p>If you feel a calling in your heart to meet her or invite her for a talk\/gathering, simply click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/frances.i-am-one.net\/contact-2\/\">contact<\/a>.

time..........<br\/>If you need to call,[masked] 1066. please RSVP, unless you decide at the last moment to come, which is ok, if you call me. but if you decide at the last minute NOT to come, please be sure to call and tell me, so we don't reserve a table for 4 people who aren't coming, and get a chair thrown at us, or worse, a real cheese omelet.<br\/>please come on time, we will not be seated without all present, or we will be seated in increments as we show up, and will be dispersed. the management is willing to work with\/accommodate us, but we need to meet them halfway, and as of late, we have not been consistent....\u00a0 they want us all present before they reserve seats for us, they will not give us a table of 8 if only 4 are there in person.\u00a0 they have reserved seating for 16 of us in the past only to have only 8 of us show up. they can't afford to keep seats empty waiting for no-shows during their busiest business hours. this has happened more than once. in regard to event time, the pancake house closes at 3pm, but sometimes lets customers linger. please do not count on this and show up at 3:45, it irks the management, and sometimes they do actually eject people at 3pm on the dot. please come as close to 1:30 as you can and communicate with me if you are having timeliness issues, decide at the last minute to come, or want to cancel, so we know what to expect for seating.....<\/p> <p>as an aside, please consider;<br\/>The real reason why this event is called 'pancakes from hell'..... today(4\/3\/2016), we had a chair AND a REAL, really cheesy-cheese omelet thrown at us for taking up reserved chair\/customer space, which lay fallow, costing the establishment moo-la. we need to be more consistent with our RSVP' status's and attendance times when it comes to our pancake events. otherwise there is hell for me to pay in my relations with this proprietor-(flames shot from his eye sockets). i am a regular at the pancake house, i live 5 blocks away, and to be a thorn in their side takes the fun out of an event, and makes patronizing their establishment on my own less pleasant for me. i don't deserve this. anyone's lack of compliance in my attendance guidelines screws up my relationship with this place of business, and i take this very personally.\u00a0 please mind your RSVP's, i understand everyone here is human and might have issues, but please take my cell number and call to cancel if you choose to do so, close to, or after, attendance time. pick up the phone, it's the least you can do. please don't make me start counting indiscretions and banning people. :-(<br\/>thank you for your consideration.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"please attend on time, or cancel if not coming. we will not be seated unless we all show. otherwise, increments of 4 or 6 will be seated, as we show up, separating us. many haven't been consistent with their RSVPs, resulting in a luke warm

Nevertheless, the evidence backing these allegations tell a different story. In the United States, the government gives asylum to German war criminals in the United States under different alias. Moreover, the Nazis work in the United States government working in high positions of science, psychology, politics, government and commerce. In addition, there is overwhelming evidence that Adolf Hitler fled to South America during \u201cOperation Winnie the Pooh\u201d, and Israel was a farce for the Rothchild destiny. Some might even claim that the Nazis were in truth the American government!<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><b>: <\/b>Lorraine Gibney is a writer, artist and lecturer. She is interested in the bizarre and occult.

SHE\u2019S BEAUTIFUL takes us from the founding of NOW, with ladies in hats and gloves, to the emergence of more radical factions of women\u2019s liberation; from intellectuals like Kate Millett to the street theatrics of W.I.T.C.H. (Women\u2019s International Conspiracy from Hell!). Artfully combining dramatizations, performance and archival imagery, the film recounts the stories of women who fought for their own equality, and in the process created a world-wide revolution. SHE\u2019S BEAUTIFUL does not try to romanticize the early movement, but dramatizes it in its exhilarating, quarrelsome, sometimes heart-wrenching glory. The film does not shy away from the controversies over race, sexual preference and leadership that arose in the women\u2019s movement. SHE\u2019S BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE\u2019S ANGRY captures the spirit of the time --- thrilling, scandalous, and often hilarious.<\/p> <p>That story still resonates today for women who are facing new challenges around reproductive rights and sexual violence, as the film shows present-day activists creating their generation's own version of feminism. SHE\u2019S BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE\u2019S ANGRY is a film about activists, made to inspire women and men to work for feminism and human rights.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

You can choose Dating or Friendship as your preferred connection.<\/p> <p>We will collect everyone's dating cards at the end of the event and email you your mutual matches within 48 hours.<\/p> <p>While this event is geared towards helping people meet potential romantic matches, you can also mingle with all the guests and find new friends as well.<\/p> <p><br\/>On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.<\/p> <p><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br\/>$24\u00a0 - PAY IN ADVANCE ONLY - WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/2016atwysnycspeeddating.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR LAST MINUTE\/DAY OF CANCELLATIONS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>All ATWYS members who pay in advance for this event will receive a promo code for $7 off other select events from our calendar (wine tastings, boat cruises, speeddating, advanced degree events, fireman parties.)

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.<\/p> <p><br\/>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

There are many different variations to it, but some very basic fundamental moves and timing structure that are fairly common. Becoming a really good salsa dancer like any other skill requires practice &amp; repetition, but the reward of being able to move effortlessly on the dance floor is more than enough reason to Practice, Practice, Practice!!!<\/p> <p><b>Bachata-<\/b> A sexy sensual dance that has really become popular over the last decade. Although not considered as difficult a dance as the salsa. It also has it's share of difficult patterns as one progresses through the learning stages. The bachata sound is fairly easy to identify with its pronounced guitar sound &amp; constant percussion tap on the fourth beat. It's becoming a dance that is essentially a must learn dance to be able to use it at any latin night!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/b\/e\/600_449396254.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/d\/2\/600_449396274.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Go Upstairs And Enter Studio...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/njsalsadance\/events\/230692922\/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"duration":5400000,"name":"Latin Dance Workshop In Morristown!

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life. If you can find a way to slow down and live more mindfully, you are well on the way to being an agent of joy and serenity in your own life and the lives of those living around you.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"A or 1 Trains to 190th Street, south entrance to the church.

Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us. I met some of the most fun and amazing people, the comics were a full top Comedy Central line up too. For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>Ari Shaffir, Gregory K. Nick Griffin, Greer Barnes, Godfrey, Christian Finnegan, Jon Laster, Damien Lemon and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup. Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/231050027\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup Free Tix! 2 Drink Minimum","id":"231050027","time":1463355000000,"updated":1463366634000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213936546000,"name":"Free NYC!

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HolisticWellnessNYC\/events\/231017269\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":694800000,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"fblgtlyvhbvb","time":1463432400000,"updated":1464128384000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1208194158000,"name":"\"Holistic Wellness NYC - Outdoor, Yoga, Hiking, Mind, Body\"","group_lon":-74,"id":1109519,"urlname":"HolisticWellnessNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Fans of Wellness"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Northeast corner of 14th Street and 3rd Avenue","name":"Northeast corner of 14th Street and 3rd Avenue","lon":-73.993538,"id":20030052,"state":"NY","lat":40.668434,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.65022611618,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461806578000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us (rain or shine) for our annual Dorm Dive.

Deep Learning is the process of learning\u00a0an Artificial Neural Network. Deep Learning falls under the sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence called\u00a0Representation Learning. Conventional ML algorithms are limited in their ability to process raw data and\u00a0rather need domain specific features extracted from the data which can be hard to do.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Representation\u00a0Learning works on raw data and solves this problem internally giving Deep Learning methods an edge\u00a0over conventional ML methods. Although there has been work on ANNs since 1960s, they have gained\u00a0momentum again in the recent few years. The reason of this being an increase of sizes of current\u00a0datasets and a boost in computational power due to parallel processing in GPUs. Deep Learning has\u00a0produced some record breaking results in the past few years in various problems including hand-written\u00a0digit identification, and digital object recognition (ImageNet). In my talk, I would like to discuss about\u00a0how Deep Learning achieves this success, why it is better than conventional ML algorithms for many\u00a0problems, challenges involved in learning a deep neural network and optimized methods for deep\u00a0learning, and newer modifications to conventional neural networks (CNNs, Auto-Encoders, etc.).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Google maps address is 185 Hudson St. We are on the 16th floor.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Data-Science-Fintech-JC-NY\/events\/231159612\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":10800000,"name":"Talk by Raghavendra on Deep Learning & Neural Networks","id":"231159612","time":1463434200000,"updated":1463581594000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454462912000,"name":"Data Science + FinTech JC-NY","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":19496586,"urlname":"Data-Science-Fintech-JC-NY","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"196a Stanton Street","name":"Stanton Street Yoga","lon":0,"id":23892201,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434408489000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>45 minutes of diving into the teachings, techniques, and practice of Meditation, for new and experienced Meditators.<\/p> <p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition.

This course provides the basics you need to get started building an Angular 2 application. First, you'll learn how to set up your environment, learning about components, templates, and data binding and how they work together. Next, you'll discover how to build clean components with strongly-typed code, as well as building nested components and how to use dependency injection to inject the services you build.

We're happy to help newcomers along with how to play, as well as how to plan strategies to win the games. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Our event is every Monday night at Dave &amp; Buster's in Westbury Long Island from 6:30pm to 10:30pm. \u00a0You can leave prior to 10:30pm if you want, also please note that Dave &amp; Buster's closes at Midnight for those who want to stay later.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most people arrive at 6:30pm. \u00a0We use the first 30 minutes to talk, order food\/drinks, and pick out games while we wait for any people that are a little late. \u00a0Promptly at 7pm we split into groups and play our games that typically take 2 hours to play. \u00a0So, if you arrive after 7pm there is a good chance that you will not be able to get into a game and can watch us play if you'd like. \u00a0At the end of the night we play a couple of additional shorter games that you can get into.<\/p> <p>This group meets in the Large Dining Room at the table directly in front of the wall with 9 Big Screen TV's (We are located 1 room over from the pool tables). \u00a0This group meets at the dining tables directly in front of the bowling lanes.\u00a0There is no cover charge to enter Dave &amp; Buster's and plenty of parking is available. Also, there is no fee to join this meetup group. All that management at Dave &amp; Buster's asks is that each person purchase $5 off their menu (it can be 1 appetizer, or 1 dessert, or a few sodas, basically whatever you choose). \u00a0<\/p> <p>Plenty of board games will be present at this event, but feel free to bring some of your favorites.

We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Naples, is one of the lesser-known Italian wine regions.\u00a0 Although only 3.5 percent of wine produced here falls into the DOC category, the volcanic hillside vineyards yield some remarkable wines of genuine quality, made from distinctive local varietals.\u00a0 Some of Italy\u2019s most distinguished whites come from here, and Taurasi, from the Aglianico grape, is one of the country\u2019s great reds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a historic winemaking region, where the local grape varieties are thought to be descendants of vines brought by ancient Greeks.\u00a0 The name of the primary red grape, Aglianico, is a corruption of <i>Elleniko,<\/i> or Greek, and the origin of the most prestigious white wine, Greco di Tufo, is pretty obvious.\u00a0 Another white of Greek origin, Falanghina, is thought to be the base of Falernum, the most celebrated wine of ancient Rome.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/e\/600_449341998.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be trying wines from two major Campania regions, where most of the DOCs are located\u2014Irpinia and Sannio.\u00a0 Plus three wines from the IGT (<i>Indicazione Geografica Tipica<\/i>) Roccamonfina, where the vineyards are on the slopes of an extinct volcano in northern Campania.\u00a0 And as an interesting ringer, a small-production Aglianico from a winemaker in Paso Robles, on California\u2019s Central Coast.<\/p> <p><i>Irpinia:\u00a0 <\/i>This is a region due east of Naples that encompasses the major appellations Taurasi, Greco di Tufo, and Fiano di Avellino.\u00a0 The grape-growing environment here is ideal\u2014high-altitude slopes, volcanic and limestone soils, and a long growing season.\u00a0 Taurasi, where vineyards start at a 400-meter elevation, owes a lot of its prestige to Antonio Mastroberardino, who was the first to make superior, modern wines in this region, based on the Aglianico grape.\u00a0 Greco di Tufo, Campania\u2019s best white, owes its distinctive smoky minerality to the tufa limestone soil.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be starting the dinner with a Greco made by Donnachiara, founded only in 2005 but already a leading estate, then we\u2019ll move on to a benchmark Mastroberardino Taurasi.<\/p> <p><i>Sannio:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a region northeast of Naples, where DOC wines must come from hillside vineyards, where the soils are more alluvial\/sedimentary rather than volcanic in origin.\u00a0 As elsewhere, the local Campania varietals are grown here, including Piedirosso, Campania\u2019s second most common red grape (although far behind Aglianico, and in decline).\u00a0 This is a fruity, soft-tannin red that is most often used as a blending grape, to soften Aglianico\u2019s tough tannins.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a varietal Piedirosso from the Beneventano IGT, a crowd-pleasing red that shows Piedirosso at its best.<\/p> <p><i>Roccamonfina IGT:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a region at the northern end of Campania, and is based on the slopes of the extinct Roccamonfina volcano.\u00a0 The mineral-rich soil produces some distinctive wines, some of which enjoy a prestige that belie the humble IGT designation.\u00a0 The Aglianico\/Piedirosso blends of Galardi enjoy a near cult status\u2014their Terra di Lavoro wines are among the most highly regarded in Campania, and are noted for their complexity and elegance.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be comparing two different vintages of Terra di Lavoro, 2009 and 2011.\u00a0 Both are considered excellent, but overshadowed by other recent vintages, thus I was able to obtain them for a reasonable price.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll compare them to a rustic, bargain-priced Roccamonfina from Starnali, a small, organic producer.<\/p> <p>Then the ringer\u2014a 100-percent Aglianico made by Giornata in Paso Robles.\u00a0 Unusual for California, they\u2019ve made a specialty of growing Italian varietals on the Central Coast.\u00a0 When I did a wine tour of Paso Robles a few years ago, the \u201907 Giornata Aglianico was the wine of the trip.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be meeting at White Street on West Broadway, a grand, high-ceilinged, chandeliered space.<\/p> <p><a

Tufo\u00a0(Irpinia)\u00a0 $14\u00a0 <\/b> <i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 The gorgeous 2014 Greco di Tufo does a terrific job of defying the odds in this difficult vintage. The wine boasts excellent mineral definition with brimstone, pencil shaving and crushed white stone backed by softer fruit tones of pear, peach and white flower. Fruit comes from 20-year-old vines and is processed in steel vats in order to maintain aromatic freshness and purity. It's a lovely proposition for near-term drinking.<\/p> <p><b>2009 I Pentri Castelvenere Piedirosso Kerres\u00a0(Sannio)\u00a0 $30\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 I Pentri\u2019s 2009 Piedirosso Kerres is one of the most intriguing wines being made in Campania. It also happens to be a great value and an equally compelling introduction to the wines of this rediscovered indigenous grape. Blackberries, black pepper, asphalt, tar, smoke and licorice burst from this racy, layered offering. Layers of perfumed fruit flow through to the generous, totally inviting finish. The Kerres captures the purest essence of Piedirosso, and it does so at an exceptionally reasonable price. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2017.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Starnali Aglianico Santo Sano\u00a0(Roccamonfina IGT) $18\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not reviewed.\u00a0 From Chambers Street Wine:<\/i>\u00a0 This is an Aglianico from vineyards close to the Roccamonfina nature reserve, among Starnali\u2019s almost 100 acres of organic grapes, olives and chestnuts. The 2010 has delicious flavors of dark plum and a deep, spicy mineral presence. The Aglianico\u2019s formidable tannins and vibrant acidity have been tamed by extra age in the bottle\u2014drink now with hearty, red sauces and other rustic Italian fare.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Fattoria Galardi Terra di Lavoro\u00a0(Roccamonfina IGT)\u00a0 $36\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013Terra di Lavoro is usually a huge wine in its youth, but not so in 2009. This is one of the most open, approachable young Terra di Lavoros I have ever tasted. The wine shows good intensity in its dark fruit, with layers of ash, smoke, crushed flowers and minerals that develop in the glass. The 2009 is a pretty, accessible Terra di Lavoro that will make a great introduction for readers who are new to the wine and don't want to wait for some of the more important vintages to come around. Terra di Lavoro is 80% Aglianico and 20% Piedirosso. The 2009 spent 14 months in French oak barrels, 70% new.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Fattoria Galardi Terra di Lavoro (Roccamonfina IGT)\u00a0 $40\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 From a hot vintage, the 2011 Roccamonfina Terra di Lavoro is a soft, round wine with a large presence of dark cherry fruit and blackberry. Dark fruit, prune, plum and dried cherry lift heavily from the bouquet. Those more obvious aromas are followed by ethereal touches of ash, licorice and plenty of balsam herb. The wine's volcanic personality shines through, although with slightly less intensity. This edition of Terra di Lavoro shows soft tannins and a long finish. It's a beautiful wine that reflects the warm year.<\/p> <p><b>2006 Mastroberardino Taurasi Radici Riserva\u00a0(Irpinia) $40 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 94<\/i> \u2013 Dark and polished, with fine tannins framing the complex mix of game, cherry reduction, cassis and mineral notes. Concentrated, delivering a long finish of tangy fruit and tar. Drink now through 2030.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17.5\/20<\/i> \u2013 Mid to deep ruby with orange rim. A little subdued on the nose with hints of undergrowth and cherry creeping up. This would have benefited from decanting. Succulent red fruit with a firm tannic spine and energetic acidity. Complex and so easy to enjoy. Almost burgundian in stature and with beautifully sculpted tannins. Bravo!<\/p> <p><b>2010 Giornata Luna Matta Vineyard Paso Robles Aglianico\u00a0(Central Coast, CA)\u00a0 $30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not reviewed.

Along the way we'll look at implementing full-text search with an embedded search engine as well as with SQLite's FTS3 tables, making sure we don\u2019t clog the UI thread while we\u2019re at it. We'll also touch on integrating your data with Core Spotlight's index on iOS 9.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSpeaker Lasse Koskela is a principal technologist at Reaktor.<\/p> <p>He has consulted companies such as Nokia, F-Secure, Rovio Entertainment and HBO.

Most of his animal specimens are insects, but also include arachnids, reptiles, amphibians and fish, all of which are harmless. The event will be an informal show-and-tell, a Q &amp; A session where guests can touch and hold the animals while Aaron answer whatever questions they may have. People can also gather around to take pictures or videos of the animals.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This event is a celebration of animals and their many different shapes, sizes and behaviors. This particularly applies to the animals we refer to as \"bugs\" or\u00a0\"creepy crawlies,\" animals that are normally misunderstood and, as a result, feared. Aaron Rodriguez's goal is for people to become open to the idea that even creatures like cockroaches and spiders get undeserved hatred. He will supervise guests and give them guidelines to properly handle his pets in a way that is positive for both the humans and the animals.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aaron Rodriguez grew up in the Bronx, New York and is currently a Masters student in Biology at New York University. As a growing profession he performs live animal shows throughout New York and New Jersey, educational show-and-tells where people can interact with and ask questions about animals. These shows are meant to inform people about animals in their many shapes, sizes and behaviors. This particularly applies to animals that are normally feared or misunderstood, such as insects and spiders. His goal is to ultimately enter a Ph.D. program in Entomology, or the study of insects, while continuing to do educational shows.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Reptile-Meetup\/events\/229241435\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Insect, Arachnids and Reptiles Petting Zoo with NYU Biology Student","id":"229241435","time":1463439600000,"updated":1463451371000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1386612672000,"name":"New York Reptile Meetup","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":11397792,"urlname":"New-York-Reptile-Meetup","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":21.5198497772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1458013238000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CLASS IS FULL.

Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person.

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for.
