Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November).

Shortly after starting college, I began a formal strength and conditioning regimen with my soccer team. I have always played sports and have always worked out but this was the first time that I knew I belonged in the fitness world. I saw improvements in my performance on and off the field. I gained confidence in my ability to go up against players much bigger than me (I am only 5\u20192\u201d!). Most importantly, I stayed in the game by staying injury free.\u00a0<br\/>After college, I took up running and triathlons. I am now competitive in local sprint triathlons and have completed 9 marathons and 3 IRONMANS. I have seen how much better I perform when I am consistent with my strength and conditioning program. It improves my endurance as well as mental toughness.\u00a0It also makes me appreciate and love my body (and not for nothing, it makes wearing a bikini at the beach fun!). I started 1 on 1 personal training in college after receiving my certification through ACSM. Since then I have worked in many atmospheres including a big gym, private studio, sports performance center, outdoor boot camps, and now for myself.\u00a0I have helped clients lose weight, build muscle, lower their BP and cholesterol, stabilize their blood sugar, complete races, and prepare and exceed in their upcoming seasons\/races.\u00a0<br\/>I am a nerd at heart and love reading anything regarding the current trends and studies in health and fitness. I also love to try new things: workout trends, gear, and food\/supplements.\u00a0 I am constantly learning to bring the best to my clients and to keep them, as well as myself, on their toes.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/us-mg5.mail.yahoo.com\/neo\/launch?.rand=c5275u8lfdhn4#\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/225866926\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"FREE TRIAL CLASS FOSTER FITNESS - WAKEFIELD MA","id":"225866926","time":1445688000000,"updated":1445734985000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":20.9279098511,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429910686000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for our regular Saturday morning meetup!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe'll play pickup doubles, changing up partners every so often to keep things interesting and well balanced. \u00a0Come on out, work the rust off your game, join our welcoming group, bring a fresh can of balls and let's play!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Easton-pickup-tennis-group\/events\/225923832\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":9000000,"name":"Saturday morning tennis in Easton","id":"kjdsglytnbgc","time":1445689800000,"updated":1445699930000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1343755233000,"name":"Easton Pickup Tennis Group","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":4436632,"urlname":"Easton-pickup-tennis-group","group_lat":42.0600013733,"who":"Tennis Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center","name":"Microsoft","lon":-71.08535,"id":15594572,"state":"MA","lat":42.362583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.805574893951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438972946000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join passionate bloggers from around the region this fall to share all there is to learn about blogging today.

The tools and methods of Shamanism will be explored. The beliefs are that the connection to the energies of Mother Earth and the connection to the energies of Spirit help you grow and learn, ultimately expanding your horizons.These beliefs are used in healings to clear trauma and discover your personal power. Shamanic Journeying will be introduced in this session.<\/p> <p><br\/>Grounding and Spiritual Hygiene - Working in the \u201cNon -Ordinary Realm\u201d and what does that look like? Connecting to the rhythms and forces of nature though rituals and sacred ceremony . Learning that healing can occur through ritual and ceremonies and how to create the sacred space and protection to prepare for your own ritual.Grounding yourself so that you are aligned with the rhythm of your life purpose and connection with spirit.<\/p> <p>Part 3 &amp; 4 \u2013 October 25 from 10am-4pm<\/p> <p>Animal Totems - Working to reconnect conscious humans with Nature and Spirit through your Animal Totems.Holding reverence for Nature around us and working with our Animal Totems. Aligning with our Animal Totems will help us to understand the archetype energy and our own powers. Sacred Space will be set and you will journey to the lower world to meet your Animal Totem. There will be time to discuss the meanings of your animal totem and your journey.Soul RetrievalsIn shamanism it is believed that a part of a human soul is free to leave the physical body when it feels emotional or physically challenged.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Soul retrieval-Where does the soul go? The soul will astral travel outside of the body going through time and space to find answers, wisdom and lost power. Once answers are found, the soul returns but sometimes the soul doesn\u2019t return or gets lost? A Soul Retrieval is needed.One of a Shamanic Practitioner\u2019s healing tools is the ability to retrieve souls and bring it back to its owner. If you feel lost, emotionally and physically drained, or something is missing this is the right workshop for you.For this journey Sue will create a sacred, loving and safe space for a soul retrieval ceremony. Sue will call upon our spirit guides, ancestors for help and use a drum to journey to find our souls, retrieve and return them. After the ceremony participants will feel complete, lighter and balanced.Reasons of why portions of the souls leaved the body will be discussed. A discussion will occur to determine which portion of your soul wants to be retrieved during the journey. Sacred space will be set and a Shamanic journey will be used for the Soul Retrieval.

Additionally, since there is only one table and the games are long, please try to arrive on time, since 1 person late will delay the whole group.<\/p> <p>Please contact <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MetrowestBoardGaming\/members\/12309799\/\">Dave M<\/a>\u00a0(click the link, then click \"Message\") for the address\u00a0as well as any other information.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TabletopGamersAlliance\/events\/225231034\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Monthly 18xx in Waltham","id":"lfnmhlytnbgc","time":1445702400000,"updated":1445714537000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1378758988000,"name":"Tabletop Gamers Alliance","group_lon":-71.5500030518,"id":10183562,"urlname":"TabletopGamersAlliance","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":3.36717581749,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1440425785000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I played a great game of Successors yesterday, which whetted my appetite for playing one of the famous GBCC monster games \"Here I Stand\" or \"Virgin Queen.\"<\/p> <p>These games are particular favorites of mine. At their heart, they're strategic wargames but the wargame aspect is surrounded by layers of other ... stuff. Theological debates. Colonization of the New World. Patronizing artists and architects and scientists. There's lots of ways to win, and even more ways to lose. I know people who never thought they'd be into a historical wargame who came away loving it. You don't have to know how to play the games to participate (though you may want to do a little studying before game time). Some experience with card driven games -- Successors, Sword of Rome, Nappy Wars, even Twilight Struggle, will help a little. I'll be there to answer questions. It'll be OK.<\/p> <p>So here's the deal: each of these games are best with exactly six players. Virgin Queen is decently playable with five. Here I Stand works OK with three. But we really want to shoot for six.<\/p> <p>Here's another deal: the games are very, very long. With relatively inexperienced players, we can start at one in the afternoon and not be surprised to still be playing at nine at night. Srsly. We love you and we totally understand if this is a dealbreaker for you, but if there's a non-trivial chance that you're going to show up and need to leave three (or even five) hours later, this is not the event for you.<\/p> <p>Here's another deal: the games really strongly hinge on throwing yourself into the negotiation aspect. This is not a case where simply sitting back and working out a winning strategy with your big ol' brain is going to win the day. You've got to make deals and make friends.<\/p> <p>Here's yet another deal: this event, if we pull it off, is probably going to be the last go-round for me and these games for quite a while, at least face-to-face. So I'm really motivated to see if we can pull it off.<\/p> <p>If you're interested in theory in this event, please RSVP and talk it up in the comments as to dates you are available in September or October. If you RSVP, there is no obligation to stick with it if the date is one not feasable for you.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/224848242\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":34200000,"name":"The Analog Reformation (Virgin Queen in Watertown)","id":"224848242","time":1445704200000,"updated":1445739249000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Reading","address_1":"37 Ash St","name":"American Legion","lon":-71.103493,"id":23591558,"lat":42.522877,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":11.4057359695,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445309210000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Friends are having a tournament at the club around the block. \u00a0Come join the fun.<\/p> <p>SATURDAY POKER \u00a0AT THE LEGION\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>American Legion 37 Ash Street, Reading Mass\u00a0<\/p> <p>October 24, 2015 \u00a0Registration starts at noon, cards fly at 1:00PM<\/p> <p>$30 buy in, starting stack 20,000; \u00a020 min levels for first three,\u00a030 minute levels after.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Rebuys $20 for 15,000, max two, $20 add on option for 15,000 at the end of level 3.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Multi table tournament, fun time! \u00a0 Food after level 5, cash bar, no smoking.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Home-game-at-the-club\/events\/226177397\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Saturday afternoon poker $30, double check the address","id":"226177397","time":1445704200000,"updated":1445741289000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410098141000,"name":"Texas Holdem, home game at the club","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":16846842,"urlname":"Home-game-at-the-club","group_lat":42.5299987793,"who":"Suburban Rounders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Somerville","address_1":"424 Highland Avenue","name":"Blue Shirt Cafe","lon":-71.12198,"id":24153193,"lat":42.396206,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.65411806107,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444837032000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's have lunch and get to know each other! :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spiritual-Souls-Practicing-the-Now\/events\/226056284\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":5400000,"name":"Lunch with friends!","id":"226056284","time":1445704200000,"updated":1445711440000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1439221245000,"name":"Spiritual Beings - Practicing the Now","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":18819392,"urlname":"Spiritual-Souls-Practicing-the-Now","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Chestnut Hill","address_1":"33 Boylston St","name":"The Street Mall","lon":-71.168716,"id":24127367,"state":"MA","lat":42.322788,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.67074012756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443759395000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>TRICK-OR-TREAT AT THE STREET<\/p> <p>Join us on Saturday, October 24th for Trick-or-Treat at The Street; a betwhitching afternoon of fun for the entire family!

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front. Also remember a hat, you need to have your head\/hair covered to serve.<\/p> <p>\u00a0My telephone number if you have any questions or have a last minute change to status is[masked]<\/p> <p>2 things:<br\/>1. Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there. My telephone # is[masked]-1526. Those letting me know that they can't make a day ahead of time won't be considered a no show.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your ongoing support.

Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs, but try to bring soft snacks so that Clovis can have some too!<\/p> <p>If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!<\/p> <p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?<\/p> <p>Please let your organizer know!<\/p> <p>We try to schedule the meetups far enough in advance so that you can plan your Puggies' social calendar! Please note that the meetups usually take place at at Assistant Organizer Sharon's home in Carver - where Buford, Millie, and Max hang out - with occasional meetups taking place at your Organizer Charlotte Creeley's home in Brockton - at Casa Clovis and Cletus. However, we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup! For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 20 to 40 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE MEETUPS<\/p> <p>We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats when you can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!<\/p> <p>Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!<\/p> <p>Your organizer pays $89.84 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SouthofBostonPugs\/events\/225437770\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":10800000,"name":"THE BUFORD MEMORIAL  PUG HALLOWEEN MEETUP!!","id":"225437770","time":1445792400000,"updated":1445814429000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1141585480000,"name":"The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group","group_lon":-71,"id":226623,"urlname":"SouthofBostonPugs","group_lat":42.0800018311,"who":"Pug People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02021","country":"us","city":"Canton","address_1":"900 Washington St","name":"Canton High School","lon":-71.147096,"id":1355229,"state":"MA","lat":42.164787,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.0809860229,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444316482000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Everyone\u2019s Invited!

Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays (parking signs should say \"EX SUNDAY\" or similar).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/events\/226153071\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cambridge Advanced (Yankee C+) Indoor Volleyball","id":"226153071","time":1445796000000,"updated":1445806297000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1185306680000,"name":"Boston Volleyball Group","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":585043,"urlname":"volleyball-122","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Volleyball players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02176","country":"us","city":"Melrose","address_1":"80 West Wyoming Avenue","name":"Lincoln Elementary School","lon":-71.071983,"id":4549582,"state":"Ma","lat":42.452801,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.42587089539,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445216891000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A Food Waste Story and Panel Discussion<br\/>featuring<\/p> <p><b>Doug Rauch<\/b>, Founder\/President, Daily Table, Boston\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Ashley Stanley<\/b>, Founder\/Executive Director, Lovin' Spoonfuls, Boston\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Jim Solomon<\/b>, Owner, The Fireplace, Brookline\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Alden Cadwell,<\/b> Director, Brookline Public Schools Food Service\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Nataka Crayton-Walker<\/b>, Co-Founder\/Farmer, City Growers, Boston\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Crystal Johnson<\/b>, Sr. Env.

Are people in Switzerland happier because it is the most democratic country in the world? Do citizens of Qatar, awash in petrodollars, find joy in all that cash? Is the King of Bhutan a visionary for his initiative to calculate Gross National Happiness? Why is Asheville, North Carolina so damn happy? With engaging wit and surprising insights, Eric Weiner answers those questions and many others, offering travelers of all moods some interesting new ideas for sunnier destinations and dispositions.<\/p> <p>From <b>Publishers Weekly Starred Review<\/b>. Fortified with Eeyoreish fatalism\u2014I'm already unhappy. I have nothing to lose\u2014Weiner set out on a yearlong quest to find the world's unheralded happy places. Having worked for years as an NPR foreign correspondent, he'd gone to many obscure spots, but usually to report bad news or terrible tragedies. Now he'd travel to countries like Iceland, Bhutan, Qatar, Holland, Switzerland, Thailand and India to try to figure out why residents tell positive psychology researchers that they're actually quite happy. At his first stop, Rotterdam's World Database of Happiness, Weiner is confronted with a few inconvenient truths. Contrary to expectations, neither greater social equality nor greater cultural diversity is associated with greater happiness. Iceland and Denmark are very homogeneous, but very happy; Qatar is extremely wealthy, but Weiner, at least, found it rather depressing. He wasn't too fond of the Swiss, either, uncomfortable with their quiet satisfaction, tinged with just a trace of smugness. In the end, he realized happiness isn't about economics or geography. Maybe it's not even personal so much as relational. In the end, Weiner's travel tales\u2014eating rotten shark meat in Iceland, smoking hashish in Rotterdam, trying to meditate at an Indian ashram\u2014provide great happiness for his readers.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will be<b> choosing<\/b> a book for January at this meeting; please come with a book suggestion.

But from the growing popularity of Armageddon and dystopian themed works of fiction like Hunger Games, Interstellar, The Walking Dead, Maze Runner, etc., it's clear that the demise our kind and culture\u00a0 somehow looms large in our collective psyche.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

I felt as if I had been raised to another dimension...made me feel expansive with heightened senses. When Trish started a low, almost guttural chant, I felt her slightly swaying. It felt familiar, comfortable-I was excited about what was happening, and had to keep reminding myself to stay in the present to fully absorb the experience.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/225889506\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"nxqpllytnbjc","time":1445900400000,"updated":1445961288000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":8.72402763367,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1343081302000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Once you've signed up here, <b>you must also send your contact\/profile info<\/b> (full name, street\/postal address, email address, age, phone number(s), and brief description of any pertinent background\/interests\/experience) to [masked]. <b>Only then will you be a full member and receive our newsletters and announcements.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>You <b>must<\/b> RSVP for all meetings and investigations by the stated deadline.<\/p> <p>Our tradition has been to meet at 7 for an optional meal (usually pizza plus soda and other goodies), for which we charge $5\/person, but participation is voluntary.<\/p> <p>Meetings usually run until 8:30 or 9 pm.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonParanormalInvestigators\/events\/219576284\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Monthly Meeting","id":"qtxwddytnbjc","time":1445900400000,"updated":1445912654000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1343077024000,"name":"Boston Paranormal Investigators","group_lon":-71.2399978638,"id":4376272,"urlname":"BostonParanormalInvestigators","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members\/Investigators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Carleton St, Building E25, Room 119","name":"Kendall Square","lon":-71.086624,"id":20798472,"state":"MA","lat":42.361622,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":38,"headcount":0,"distance":0.8578748703,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":9,"created":1442515096000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(Please note our\u00a0<b>new RSVP policy<\/b>\u00a0below.)\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/8\/600_436680296.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are a casual group of people who enjoy playing\u00a0<b>complex\u00a0<\/b>board games -- the kind of board games that\u00a0<b>make you think.<\/b>\u00a0We play a variety of games, most of which are\u00a0<b>Euro\u00a0<\/b>style games of medium complexity. \u00a0Games often last 90 minutes or more and involve juggling a lot of rules and factors in your head, to decide what to do. \u00a0However, there's also plenty of laughter and friendship involved. \u00a0If that sounds up your alley, we hope you'll join us.<\/p> <p>Our weekly meetup is in a\u00a0<b>TERRIFIC space for games<\/b> steps from the Kendall Square T, with easy parking, and lots of room to spread out in. \u00a0Full directions are below. \u00a0The building door does get locked in the evening, but there is plenty of foot traffic in and out. \u00a0If you expect to arrive later than 8:30, send Tucker a message earlier in the day, and we'll make sure someone is there to let you in.<\/p> <p>Our meetups happen once a week (alternating Mondays and Wednesdays), from 7:00 pm onwards. \u00a0Our group has been running since 2007, and we have a large crowd of regulars as well as new members each week.<\/p> <p><b>BEANTOWN GAMERS RSVP POLICY:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/226168926\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytnbjc","time":1445902200000,"updated":1445961972000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"52 Church Street","name":"Sinclair","lon":-71.12075,"id":16744672,"state":"MA","lat":42.374081,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":11,"distance":2.77327680588,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":5,"created":1444928195000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>As knitters and crocheters (and crafters in general), we know a lot of truths - I'm guessing many of them about the universe.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/226213073\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":6300000,"name":"Tuesday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"nknsdlytnbkc","time":1445962500000,"updated":1445970471000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01801","country":"us","city":"Woburn","address_1":"10 Micro Drive","name":"VinKari Safari","lon":-71.136513,"id":15634992,"state":"MA","lat":42.471436,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.43106842041,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445002221000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>VinKari Safari is one of the cleanest, well organized, and best indoor play places I've ever been to.

Against this backdrop, channel providers face difficult choices, with shrinking resale margins and customers that demand responsiveness. In this talk, Brian Singer will draw on his experience at Orbitera working with dozens of channel organizations to provide a clear understanding of how to build margin in a cloud-focused business, how cloud impacts the economics of the channel, and what to look for when working with a cloud managed services or channel provider.<\/p> <p><br\/>Brian Singer is the Co-Founder of Orbitera, a cloud commerce startup.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/226259563\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"NYAJ GIFTS - BUY NOW AND SAVE","id":"226259563","time":1445985000000,"updated":1445997118000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"677 Huntington Avenue, Kresge 201","address_2":"Longwood Medical Area, Brigham Circle","name":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health","lon":0,"id":23701718,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":56,"headcount":0,"distance":1.72169387341,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437959319000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/<\/a><\/a> - for Google Maps<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?daddr=677+Huntington+Avenue+Boston+MA+02115\">Directions from YOUR starting point...<\/a><\/p> <p>Until further notice, we're in Kresge 201 (which has been newly-refurbished), at the top of the open stairwell near the guard's desk near the Countway Courtyard entrance to the Kresge Building.<\/p> <p>Fred (ZHOU Hanlin) and Justin Kwan host these friendly meetups (in Kresge 201). \u00a0<br\/>Enter as you have long done; then walk UP the open stairway near the security guard's desk.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Mandarin speakers want to practice English (and reduce their Chinese accents)?<br\/>* English speakers want to learn Mandarin?<br\/>* Nerdy Chinese folks want to bring friends and have a fun, FREE \"outing\" in Boston just talking with nerdy strangers in English or Mandarin?<\/p> <p><b>Schedule<\/b>:<br\/><b>Before 6:30 pm<\/b> - free conversations - so arrive early - as early as 5:30 pm<\/p> <p>[masked] Introductions!

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/226165432\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytnbkc","time":1445985000000,"updated":1445997078000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Lawrence","address_1":"290 Merrimack St. ","name":"BodynBrain Yoga, Tai Chi","lon":-71.150101,"id":24123884,"state":"MA","lat":42.702705,"repinned":false},"headcount":4,"distance":24.0763225555,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445218895000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I will now be holding meetup at my new yoga studio.

You will hear about how choosing the Solr approach saved us a ton of custom development, and enabled us to offer end-users features such as personalization, faceted search and navigation of various types of content (e.g., people, events, alumni stories), autocomplete, and a geolocation mapping UI for navigating the people directory. In addition to a demo of the end-user UI, the talk will outline technical implementation details\u2014these will include how we modeled the content in the database to work with Solr, developed a \u201csearch wrapper\u201d to handle access control by brokering the requests\/responses between the UI layer and Solr, and developed a custom Java loader to import content from our RDBMS into Solr. In short, this talk will describe the path we took in adopting Solr, speed bumps and potholes we hit along the way, where we are currently, and what the future roadmap looks like for using Solr in the HBS Enterprise.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Talk 2:\u00a0\"Stump The Chump\"\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/people.apache.org\/~hossman\/\">Chris \"Hoss\" Hostetter<\/a>\u00a0was the first ever Solr user at CNET Networks in 2005, helping to define\u00a0what Solr was and what it eventually became at the Apache Software\u00a0Foundation.

I\u2019ll offer ways to save paradise Earth.<\/p> <p>If you doubt that people screw up massively and often, consider the eight decades of gasoline with the known poison lead damaging kids\u2019 brains and raising crime levels about 4 times the base level (for the profit of oil companies). How about the low fat craze of the last 4 decades that deprived us of healthy fats, loaded our diets with sugars and processed carbs, and caused the steady rise in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s. And how about the USA\u2019s many needless wars, and today\u2019s many civil wars like the one that has destroyed Syria.<\/p> <p>The fundamental causes of these ongoing disasters are not as simple as just greed and unregulated capitalism. Starting with some of the most obviously destructive instincts (think of the damage) and continuing with increasingly deep underlying causes, consider:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Hyper-conservatism<\/b> kept a tribe safe through cautious consumption of resources, punishment of wrong doers, and fear of outsiders<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Mythical beliefs<\/b>, as religion, gave a budding empire unifying ideology to defend and fervently spread to \u201cignorant pagans\u201d<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Mindless conformity<\/b> kept food and family safe and enabled leaders to recruit massive armies<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Normalcy bias<\/b>, denying the likelihood of a disaster, kept tribe from panicky overreaction to every serious danger facing them<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Ostracism of nonconformists<\/b> threatened their lives, so today the very few folks that finally figure out what drives us to disaster are ignored or opposed by their friends, struggle to find a group that values their revelations appropriately, and eventually give up<\/p> <p>Other instincts and their modern consequences will be explained. One is food bingeing on the nutrients foragers struggled to get: carbs (sugar and starch), meat, fat, and salt, not leaves like kale.<\/p> <p>To prevent collapse and move toward paradise Earth, the diverse progressive issue groups must unite with the Democratic Party, agree on values and policy, communicate more effectively, and exploit political and marketing techniques as the Republicans do. They must deal with:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Republican dirty tricks<\/b> Dems must reveal and fight gerrymandering, voter suppression (excessive ID demands), buying up the media, lying profusely, and now hacking the voting machines<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>More than paragraphs<\/b> Dems\u2019 pamphlets and websites are little more than paragraphs and a few photos. To communicate much faster, the best writers find the deep structure of the information and present it using that structure, such as outlines, tables, timelines or diagrams, with lots of headings. Then readers can quickly skip stuff they know or don\u2019t care about, and review later.<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Liberal-Conservative agreement<\/b> Focus on issues most pols agree on (not the extreme Right) such as improved education, infrastructure, health, sustainable economy, research subsidies<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Unseat Right-wingers<\/b> Effective communication through websites, pamphlets, and retail campaigning can threaten extremists\u2019 jobs, and they know their job alternatives are limited<\/p> <p>The US has hope for a much better future for our offspring, but don\u2019t count on the predicted acceleration of technology in the Singularity. The most advanced technologies such as artificial general intelligence and biotech are being developed for military, big pharma, hospitals, distracting social media, and not for happy, healthy people and effective democracy.<\/p> <p>Quick references will be handed out for continued study.

Mun Su Sah Buddhist Temple has the best vibes around and we are going to make the healing sounds necessary to take you on the journey you need. Requesting a $20 Donation.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sound healing can change your life. That is why I do it. Oh the places you'll go! The more open you are to sound the deeper your journey will be. You will feel the vibration coursing through you, moving energy, filling you with the power behind the sound. If you've never done anything like this, you should give it a try. You'll be laying down on a yoga mat or a couple of comfy cushions with a blanket and just letting the sound wash over you. It's not called a sound bath for nothing. You'll be able to feel it remove stuck energy in your energy field and many say that it feels like a weight has been lifted! You might just come away feeling ten pounds lighter!<\/p> <p>The sound itself is precise as it is pure.\u00a0Harmonic overtones from chanting and singing bowls revitalize the immune system and support healthy cell function. When we hear the vibration of the single string, which is the fundamental sound of a note, we also hear many other notes which are known as overtones. Harmonic overtone chanting is the ability to create two or more notes simultaneously with the mouth and tongue - the fundamental note and one or more higher sounds of a different pitch. The relationship between the notes creates coherence and harmony.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The epicenter of their national Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) is in London, where Maud Watts (played by Carey Mulligan) is a working-class wife and mother; she and husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) toil at a laundry. Startled one day by a protest, Maud recognizes a co-worker, Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff), among the agitators. Initially unwilling to get involved in the Suffragette cause, Maud comes to realize that she must claim her dignity both at home and in her workplace \u2026<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y4jBXQM7mIk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y4jBXQM7mIk<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/226278354\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Suffragette   10-29 Thur.

Now, the tables have turned: Concerns about what some see as a U.S. \u201cdragnet\u201d and unwarranted privacy intrusions have compelled other countries to revamp their own privacy protections. Legislation, both at home and abroad, hasn\u2019t kept pace with technological developments, leaving some wondering if privacy as we know it is long dead.<\/p> <p>With \u201ccyberspace\u201d increasingly seen as a new plane of warfare, how can we ensure the country\u2019s networks are protected? Can policymakers and technological titans create a system nimble enough to capture threats while simultaneously protecting citizens\u2019 right to privacy?

People who RSVP \"Yes\" to events are expected to exercise common sense and common courtesy. That means making your best effort to keep any commitments that you make, but if necessary doing your best to notify the Event Organizer or (preferably, if it's the day of the event) the venue if something comes up after the RSVP deadline. If you find yourself unable to attend an event that you've RSVPed \"Yes\" to and you cannot either change your RSVP or let the venue know, please do contact the Event Organizer when you're able to, just to let us know that you're okay and that you're still interested in attending events.<\/p> <p>Failure to do the above may result in your removal from the group at the Group Organizer's

It really inspired me, to have all those voices sounding as one, voicing the words of inspired musicians. I have yearned to create a local song circle ever since that time. Since my musical abilities are not aligned with leading a song circle, I just kept hoping someone would come along to lead. Getting to know Carolyn over time I became aware of her extraordinary qualities as a song leader. Eventually, one day, I asked, would you like to lead a song circle? I'll organize. We can hold it here. And, voila... we set up our first SpiritSong Circle here in Stow.

We can live in a consciousness that can be called many things. We call it peace. It can also be called \u201cwell-being\u201d or \u201cliving in the zone\u201d or \u201cgrace\u201d or \"acceptance\". It is not passive or inactive, but vital and alive. It is a consciousness in which we see clearly; we accept what is present; we know what is possible; and we see how to cooperate with what is present in a positive way. It is the way we are functioning when we are at our best making a positive contribution. We enrich our individual lives, our social situations and the world at large. The way it manifests in each of us may be quite different because we are unique beings. When you are living in this consciousness, what would you call it?<\/p> <p>During this meeting, we will move into this consciousness that we call peace. It is always present within us -- no matter what else is going on inside us or outside us in the world. As we practice recognizing our inner core of peace, we become increasingly able to choose to live in that consciousness of inner peace, even at difficult times of our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will look at where we unconsciously practice \"against-ness\", and learn to let go of that against-ness. We then work better with reality and with the people who surround us. As we let go of \"against-ness\", we also let go of the upset feelings, prejudices, judgments, tenseness, etc.\u00a0This is a process that occurs naturally without any effort on our part. As we let go of our \u201cagainst-ness\u201d, this consciousness naturally shows up.<\/p> <p>This work is grounded in the realization that peace must start with the individual. One cannot fight for peace. If we are going to be a conduit for this consciousness, we must start with ourselves and be in peace. This consciousness is defined as the absence of against-ness. If we can be in peace without being against others or ourselves or situations and encourage others to do the same, then we can be a conduit for this consciousness into the world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this meeting, we are collectively planting seeds of peace for ourselves, New England, the world and more.

It\u2019s easy enough to adapt the type styles we can control\u2014`font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height` and so on\u2014to a wide range of viewports. Fonts themselves are pretty inflexible, though\u2014we\u2019re stuck loading every possible weight and style we could potentially need, across all our breakpoints.

Back to back sound healing. Come to Mun Su Sah Temple in Wakefield tomorrow for a hallowed sound healing from 8:30pm-9:45pm. A lady tonight asked if I was singing while I was playing the bowls because she couldn't tell. That's the art, to merge with the sound so not even I am able to tell which is which!<\/p> <p>Please join me for a hallowed healing journey through the heart of sound. Through my singing bowls and overtone chanting, I will take you to a point of deep stillness where healing happens! Mun Su Sah Buddhist Temple at 231 Salem St. in Wakefield has the best vibes around I am going to make the healing sounds necessary to take you on the trip you need. Requesting a $20 Donation.<\/p> <p>Sound healing can change your life. That is why I do it. Oh the places you'll go! The more open you are to sound the deeper your journey will be. You will feel the vibration coursing through you, moving energy, filling you with the power behind the sound. If you've never done anything like this, you should give it a try. You'll be laying down on a yoga mat or a couple of comfy cushions with a\u00a0blanket and just letting the sound wash over you. It's not called a sound bath for nothing. You'll be able to feel it remove stuck energy in your energy field and many say that it feels like a weight has been lifted! You might just come away feeling ten pounds lighter!<\/p> <p>The sound itself is precise as it is pure. Harmonic overtones from chanting and singing bowls revitalize the immune system and support healthy cell function. When we hear the vibration of the single string, which is the fundamental sound of a note, we also hear many other notes which are known as overtones. Harmonic overtone chanting is the ability to create two or more notes simultaneously with the mouth and tongue - the fundamental note and one or more higher sounds of a different pitch. The relationship between the notes creates coherence and harmony. The acoustic power of overtone harmonics will resonate with you, taking you to a place of wholeness, happiness and health.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Mun Su Sah is based out of a large white house with a spacious parking lot out from and its directly across the street from Wakefield Variety Store","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soul-Experiments\/events\/226387686\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":4500000,"name":"The Hallowed Healing","id":"226387686","time":1446165000000,"updated":1446170826000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1316996187000,"name":"Soul Experiments","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":2542822,"urlname":"Soul-Experiments","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02108","country":"us","city":"Boston","phone":"617.742.0306","address_1":"6 Beacon Street","name":"6B Lounge Martini Bar","lon":-71.061615,"id":904863,"state":"MA","lat":42.35799,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.450802713633,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439669850000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Just show up ready to support our Miami Dolphins!!<\/p> <p>This game will definitely be televised locally, but come on out to 6B Lounge anyway and watch it with the rest of your Boston Dolfan Friends!!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

From its inception Max\/MSP has been conceived as platform where musicians take advantage of audio programming tools and experiment with modular approaches to compose and synthesize their sounds, without having to code.

In the workshop the \u201cdouble-nature\u201d of the program will be illustrated in various examples. The \u201copen\u201d character of the platform has stimulated the creation of a wealth of new techniques in the field of sound manipulation, analysis and (live) computer-human interaction. Some of these techniques will be discussed.

With the evolution of digital health and healthcare innovation, BYHP has gathered leaders from across healthcare to drive discussions about the current state of digital health and innovation, and what the future will hold in this growing space. We will also have interactive workshops that will teach attendees how to think more like an innovator and how they can apply these skills to their everyday work. By the end of this conference, the audience should leave with a toolkit that will empower them to make an impact in their current roles and beyond.<\/p> <p>\u00a0In addition to three keynotes, attendees will have the option to select three of six panel sessions when they register for the event. Our panels are broken out into two tracks:<\/p> <p>(1) The Intrapreneuer Series will focus on an emerging trend within digital health, giving attendees the knowledge of the topic's current state and how it will evolve over time. With panelists that span the healthcare industry, you will be able to hear multiple perspectives on these topics.\u00a0<\/p> <p>(2)\u00a0 The Disruptor Series will focus on professional development, giving attendees a toolbox that will allow them to tackle healthcare issues from a new angle. These workshops will be more interactive. Because of this, seating for these sessions will be limited.<\/p> <p>\u00a0To end the conference, we will have a networking and startup-demo session. Attendees will get a chance to network with others and experience healthcare innovations firsthand as startups from around Boston will be displaying prototypes of their products.<\/p> <p>Other Information<\/p> <p>* Food and drink will be provided during the conference.<\/p> <p>* Current BYHP members will receive an e-mail with a discount code which will give them 50% off the ticket price.<\/p> <p>* Non-members who purchase an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.byhp.org\/#%21services\/ch6q\">annual BYHP Membership<\/a> between July 28th, 2015 to October 30th, 2015 will receive a discount code that will give them 60% off the ticket price.

(Thank you Larry!) What I discovered at this location was so stunning I had two immediate reactions. One was, <i>Oh I can't wait to bring the group here<\/i>, and the other was, <i>Oh I am so glad to be here all by myself<\/i>. There was such a special quality of peace, beauty and tranquility it felt almost like discovering a secret urban sanctuary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I had had a terrible technology week and after just 3 hours photographing these landscapes, I felt revitalized and renewed. I truly think beauty in nature brings us back to ourselves when we get too busy and cast away. Join me to slow down and breath next Saturday. \u00a0The forest is deep, the stones are ancient, and the water is crystal clear.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/e\/1\/600_443542497.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Reflection of Echo Bridge.<\/p> <p><br\/>So my dilemma was, should I keep this secret place to myself or share it with you? As a compromise I have decided to take just a small group here next week. I am eager to share the beauty of this location with a few of you and help you see like an artist.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/1\/2\/600_443542546.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Finding your path step by step.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0I don't feel it is appropriate to bring a large group. (We had 20 for the Mount Auburn Cemetery shoot.) This location will be best for those of you who have attended at least 3 of my workshops in the past. This way I will know you have some of the foundational pieces and can focus on some deeper ways of seeing that I want to introduce at this time. You will need to know your basic camera operation choices so you can shoot in both aperture and shutter priority with a little help from me.

As always, I will touch upon the three fundamentals of good photography, creative SEEING, DOING the right thing technically, and BEING in tune with the subject.<\/p> <p><br\/>It is also necessary that you be very steady on your feet. The path is steep in some spots and a bit rocky. You can take your time and find the easy path but you must have good hiking shoes or sneakers.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/1\/b\/600_443542811.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>View from on top of the bridge we will hike to.<\/p> <p><b>So to summarize this special workshop is for you if:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You have attended a minimum of 3 workshops with me.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You are steady on your feet and have good walking shoes<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You are familiar with your basic camera settings.<\/p> <p>Logistics: You can reach this location on the green line.

And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son.

You should feel comfortable swimming at least a couple lengths continuously (but if you're not and would be interested in learning to swim, leave a comment and maybe we can organize something!).<\/p> <p>The pool opens at 2pm this fall instead of 1:45 like it did in the spring, so we'll meet to go in around 1:45 so that we can be out on the pool deck by 2. $6 to get in, Cambridge residents $5 (or you can buy a 10-pack for an approximate 10% discount, and we do these weekly so you'll have the opportunity to use them up).<\/p> <p>Street parking is available but stressful, and the 69 bus drops off down the block, or you can bike or run there and do 2\/3 of a triathlon :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-LGBT-Triathlon-Group\/events\/226319600\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Saturday swim workout - Halloween edition","id":"226319600","time":1446314400000,"updated":1446430092000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1393266861000,"name":"Boston LGBT Triathlon Group (Swimmers, Cyclists, or Runners)","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":13050962,"urlname":"Boston-LGBT-Triathlon-Group","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"LGBT, Swimmers, Bikers, Runners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"Church St. & Massachusetts Ave","name":"Johnston Gate, Harvard Yard","lon":-71.118645,"id":24176035,"state":"MA","lat":42.37461,"repinned":true},"headcount":35,"distance":2.69235348701,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445977584000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The foliage is just starting to peak in Cambridge and Harvard Yard has some interesting locations to shoot, from the huge, sunken Japanese Maple in the courtyard of the Pusey Library to the Radcliffe Sunken Garden a few short blocks away.

In previous years, volunteer ride marshals held car traffic at intersections so the group could stay together through intersections. Unfortunately, this system starts to break down when we have more than a few hundred people, and we passed that tipping point in 2014. We learned that it's nearly impossible to hold intersections for more than a few minutes without angering drivers, and putting volunteers in danger. This year, we\u2019re changing to a different marshalling format where volunteers won\u2019t hold car traffic at intersections. Instead,<\/p> <p><br\/>*Riders will follow all traffic rules, stopping at stop signs and red lights.<\/p> <p>*Volunteer Ride Marshals will stand on the sidewalk and tell you when to turn.<\/p> <p>*As a rider, just keep riding straight until you see a volunteer directing you to turn!<\/p> <p>*We\u2019ll have a secret outdoor dance party stop along the way for you to catch up with your friends!<\/p> <p>This way, everyone knows where to ride to stay on route, nobody gets lost, and we minimize tension between riders and drivers.
