Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English?&nbsp; <br>3. Ready to work&nbsp;<i>REALLY&nbsp;<\/i>hard and do the REAL work that it will take to truly become fluent?&nbsp; <br>4. Are you also ready to have fun and make friends who are as serious about language learning as you are?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If so, my name is Monroe Mann, and WELCOME TO THE FLUENCY PROJECT.&nbsp; <br> <br>MY DEFINITION OF NATIVE-LEVEL FLUENCY:&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of what is said on TV, in movies, and on the radio&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of modern slang&nbsp; <br>--can effectively and clearly communicate orally and in writing, with 99% grammatical and linguistic accuracy, not including technical conversations&nbsp; <br>--can read modern fiction, history books, newspapers, and magazines with a 99% word and sentence comprehension rate, without use of a dictionary<\/p>\n<p>I'm a linguist myself, and speak Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, and others (at various levels of proficiency). While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example:&nbsp; <br>* read books;&nbsp; <br>* write essays;&nbsp; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises&nbsp; <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy&nbsp; <br>* give presentations;&nbsp; <br>* watch movies;&nbsp; <br>* listen to the radio;&nbsp; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on.&nbsp; <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:)&nbsp; <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived.&nbsp; <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic&nbsp; <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup!&nbsp; <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

I want people to truly get to know each other...to have good conversation...I don't want this to feel like a networking\/pickup-y\/name-tag kind of group.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><strong>Our<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>group (whose&nbsp; events will be purposefully small&nbsp;in size) is not&nbsp;like other Meetup groups <\/strong>where you can&nbsp;feel anonymous.&nbsp; <strong>Not showing up<\/strong> for events of this size <strong><em>does<\/em> affect the host and other attendees<\/strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that things happen.&nbsp; All I ask is that <strong>if you can no longer attend, <\/strong>or have a strong sense you will be <strong>held up at work or with family issues<\/strong>, that you <strong>give me Two Hours notice.&nbsp; Anyone who simply does not show up or give me&nbsp;sufficient notice<\/strong> that they can no longer&nbsp;make&nbsp;the event (<em>or else who doesn't provide a damn good explanation and profuse apology after the fact ....lol<\/em>), <strong>will have to be removed from the group<\/strong>..&nbsp; I don't do this to be a taskmaster or anything...it's just&nbsp;<strong>very disheartening for me&nbsp;to pay Meetup Organizer dues,&nbsp; arrange events<\/strong>, provide very detailed information on events to the group, and <strong>then for me to&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;the venue, only to find a bunch of no-shows<\/strong>.&nbsp; All I ask is for <strong>common courtesy.&nbsp; If you're not prepared to give me&nbsp;that, that you shouldn't join <\/strong>this group.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Thank you for your understanding!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every so often I will arrange for a somewhat larger outing<\/strong>, once I feel that enough good relationships have been created between members of the group. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>'YES' to:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>- members that are <b>engaging<\/b>, who have a <b>positive energy<\/b>, with <b>varied interests<\/b>, and who are <strong>comfortable meeting new people and diving right into conversation!&nbsp;&nbsp; All profiles must include a clear photo <\/strong>of YOU (no sunglasses, no hat, no fuzzy\/long-distance photos, no photos of pets or avatars) <strong>and&nbsp;your real name<\/strong> (i.e., not the name of a Superhero, etc.)&nbsp; I don't like hosting small,&nbsp;intimate events and having no clue who I am to meet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>- <\/strong>members who understand <strong>our events will generally be small and intimate, <\/strong>and that&nbsp;<strong>communicating to the host if you can no longer attend, is expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p> - events where we <b>support and enjoy both<\/b> the n<b>ew AND the old-school establishments of Astoria<\/b>. <i>(I think it's hugely important to support the small businesses that have been in Astoria for more than a few years, and which seem to be gradually disappearing due to rent increases, etc,)<\/i> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>'NO to:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> - joining this group with the <b>sole purpose<\/b> of hoping to <b>fill that romantic void i<\/b>n your life.&nbsp; (I<i> prefer members who already consider their lives full and engaging versus people who come to events, scope out the attendees, decide there's no one that 'interests' them, and then they disengage from the group.)&nbsp; <\/i>There are plenty of other 'singles' Meetup groups if that's your area of focus. <br><\/p>\n<p>- joining this group because you <b>see all Meetup members as potential clients<\/b> for your business, product, etc.<\/p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br><\/p>\n<p>I find groups most interesting when they have&nbsp;a <b>good mix of members&nbsp;(singles\/couples, straight\/gay, younger\/older, etc.,<\/b>) so no one should think this group might not be for them!&nbsp; I'd like to have members who've already figured out that you can be good friends with people who have <b>different backgrounds from you, different political views, economic backgrounds, much older\/younger than you<\/b>, etc.&nbsp; What matters most is that we all are <b>people with positive energy, and respect each others' viewpoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; To help offset the fees<\/strong> that I must pay to Meetup.com each month as a Group Organizer, I'd like to <strong>kindly ask for a $2 donation from each member, whenever they attend one of our events<\/strong>.&nbsp; Thank you!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for your interest, and hope to see you soon!

A disproportionate number of young people are labeled and treated for A.D.D. in the U.S. compared to most other countries.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks.

To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

There is a $3 meetup fee that will be collected offline at the end of the meetup when the bill arrives. It will be used to offset the meetup organizational costs ($180 per year for running a group). Please bring enough cash to cover this. If you sign up for a meetup and fail to show up (2) times or cancel within 2 days of the meetup, you will be removed from this group and banned.

NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities. Now is the time to join forces to protect, foster, and strengthen the local businesses in our neighborhoods that give us a sense of place, ensure our diverse culture, and provide us with strong unique communities we are proud to call home","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14366314,"name":"Karen Brown-Stovell"},"members":22,"name":"Newark Forward Ever Business Alliance Meetup","id":18889045,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Newark-Forward-Ever-Business-Alliance-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Localists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441121892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More-testing\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Tus us to nick si do belfry fleet bled Clift sm ni fb agog Cheryl varnish cleon Xbox sm bc clerk Clifty salud cl do all\u00edspey delito vi salvocorreo claro<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","members":2,"name":"More testing","id":18889179,"state":"NY","urlname":"More-testing","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441122327000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"apache-spark","name":"Apache Spark","id":1471442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spark-Meetup\/","rating":4.8,"description":"NYC Spark users group for those interested in distributed computing technologies.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":117500482,"name":"Matthew Hunt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/highres_229314142.jpeg","photo_id":229314142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/member_229314142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/thumb_229314142.jpeg"}},"members":563,"name":"New York Spark Meetup","id":18889202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Spark-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sparkies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441135114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223},{"urlkey":"social-philanthropy","name":"Social Philanthropy","id":113816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BE-A-FRIEND-Walkathon-2015\/","rating":0,"description":"Join friends, family members and colleagues as you walk, run or stroll along beautiful Hudson River Park in support of Samaritans 24-hour Suicide Prevention Center at our 2nd Annual BE A FRIEND 5K Walkathon, Saturday, September 19.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not.

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws.

PICKUP SOCCER NYC is an organized, co-ed recreational group that holds open soccer games year-round several days a week at playing fields across Manhattan. All games are held on full-sized grass\/turf playing fields with anywhere from 12-30 players per given game. Attendance is optional once you sign up and you can attend as few or as many games as you wish. The group is composed of players of all ages, backgrounds and nationalities. We are not a league nor do we use refs or officials. We moderate games ourselves making our own calls. We do not keep score.

Just looking to see who's interested in this sort of idea - dinner's can be held at different times, I'm a night-owl (I work evening shifts), and it's hard to find late-night meetups similar to this, so for others like me, that tend to eat\/sleep late (midnight dinners are pretty common), this would be perfect for you!

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting? Each meeting will consist of a forum providing compliance advice for a specific aspect of the technology sector (e.g. WCAG guidelines for website\/app design, payment systems compliance issues, cryptocurrency issues, etc...), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A for items to be discussed either at that meeting or answered in the following meeting. The meetings will start in November and will be held on a monthly basis. We look forward to seeing you there!

The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.<br>EO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.<br>EO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.<br>From time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.<br>Members' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.<br>Professional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.<br>From time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game.

We are a smallish sized group that enjoys playing together once every week or two at the local public golf courses.&nbsp;<span>Please note that this is NOT a singles meetup type of event. It's for people who enjoy playing golf and enjoy it that much more when playing with a compatible group. &nbsp;<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My ideal is to have eight people (for two foursomes) for each outing. At this point, we have a core of 3 to 4 people who show up most of the time. Others have then joined in a meetup just on occasion. That's all fine. Playing with new(ish) members of the group is part of what makes it fun.&nbsp;<\/span><span>As space permits, bring along a friend to play if that helps round out getting two full foursomes.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Although I'm mostly thinking of a group of guys playing golf, I don't want to be exclusionary. Women would be welcome. So far this summer a couple of women have played. Last summer no women played golf with our group. Hey, whatever.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>If you can say \"yes\" to most of these questions then you would be pretty compatible with the group:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. You're a young senior. ... For myself I'm 62. But ages in the group range.<\/p>\n<p>2. You're available during weekdays to play. ... Wanted so we can get cheaper rates. Being retired or semi-retired helps.<\/p>\n<p>3. You're nearby (within 7 or so miles of Cranford). ... This ties in with keeping the group small.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. You play in the area. ... As for me, I normally play at these public courses: Hyatt Hills, Ashbrook, &amp; Galloping Hill. &nbsp;We also play at some courses farther afield (like the Rutgers golf course) and have had fun with it. From a survey of the group most members want a variety in the courses we play and are also up for higher end courses on occasion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. You can ALREADY play golf. ... You can be somewhat poor, average, or quite good. ... My own handicap is a 26 (on the weak side, but seriously hope to improve). ... Note: Let me add that in joining this group <i>you pretty much need to be able to break 100 at least on occasion<\/i> (my definition of \"somewhat poor\"). <i>BUT<\/i> if you can keep up your pace of play this can offset playing poorly. ... Frankly, at this writing we are trying to determine what works best. I want to be inclusive (especially given that I don't always break 100 myself). But then it can be frustrating for some of the better golfers if they have to deal with slow play. So if you don't play reasonably well you need to be sure you can keep up your pace of play so that you don't hold up everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>6. You follow good golf etiquette. ... You know and follow the rules. But if you need a mulligan please take it. &nbsp;And to keep up our pace of play &nbsp;again we follow \"ready golf\". That means you don't need to wait for the farthest away to hit first if you're ready to hit.<\/p>\n<p>7. Good attitude. ... Even if your game is going poorly you enjoy being out and can joke around with others. 'Nuff said? I think so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p> <span>We also sometimes try to add some competition to add to the fun of playing. One thing we've done at times is to use match play with two person teams. Each team takes their best score for each hole and tries to beat the other team(s) best score on a hold-by-hole basis. You can of course still keep your own personal score.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>So let's keep it simple and fun.

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give. This work demands of us at all times a deepened understanding and an increased ability to penetrate to new levels of consciousness so lifting humanity as a whole. http:\/\/www.lucistrust.org\/en\/service_activities\/start_a_meditation_group\/resource_center","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193144989,"name":"Lucis Trust","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/highres_250178629.jpeg","photo_id":250178629,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/member_250178629.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/thumb_250178629.jpeg"}},"members":54,"name":"New York Meditation as a Way of Life","id":18986696,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-as-a-Way-of-Life","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443731112000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-growing-professionals\/","rating":4.66,"description":"<p>When you no longer feel a true connection with the crowd you grew up with and the co-workers...

It's a Movement born out of a weariness with the status quo that puts HR leaders and doers in a box. WGNinHR is busting us out of those boxes, and breaking all paradigms. It's for those who dare to ask 'what's next?', expecting to be challenged to new levels in HR - or even outside of it...to the C-Suite and perhaps, eventually, to the top seat. After launching as a (virtual) membership organization (<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgninhr.org\">www.wgninhr.org<\/a><\/b>), WGNinHR is now ready to establish a NY presence. If you'd like to meet like-minded HR pros looking for creative ways to advance their careers, join this growing Movement - and become a part of our Meetup. &nbsp;The Meetups will include networking, light refreshments and interactive learning opportunities!<\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s in a Name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On playgrounds across the nation, and maybe even the globe, someone is screaming out a familiar question \u2013 \u2018who\u2019s got next?!\u2019&nbsp; The question is asked of the person confident enough to step onto the court or playground, grab the ball \u2013 and then do something <i>amazing<\/i> with it.&nbsp; That\u2019s where the name for this organization came from.&nbsp; Its focus is on the HR professional who dares to not only ask the \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 question, but to shape the answer! <\/p>\n<p>This is a Movement looking to challenge your thinking, and that of the folks who surround you who may be suffocating your career aspirations, perhaps unintentionally. The fact is, too many HR pros are convinced that they can\u2019t aspire to more \u2013 in their fields, outside their fields, to the C-Suite and even to the CEO seat.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is for you.&nbsp; Whether you\u2019re the aspiring HR pro having just graduated and in your first HR gig, or the more seasoned among us with 20+ years of HR and business experience.&nbsp; This is for you <i>if <\/i>you truly believe that there\u2019s more to your career story.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>NY Trailblazers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The goal is a monthly meetup like no other.&nbsp; Yes, there will be networking which is awesome.

I am calling this conclave Voki-all-joyo. Each week, on Sunday morning, we will meet for a presentation, discussion, and sharing of ideas. These ideas are meant to be about the issues most important to your heart: <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;Why are you here? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you believe? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you learn? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How do you succeed? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp; What should you being doing to make the world better? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How can you be happy(ier)?<\/p>\n<p>This is not about doctrine, dogma, or definiteness. This is about dialectics, discourse, and discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Each week a topic or theme will be presented around ideas or thoughts from the realms of science, western philosophy, eastern philosophy, and literature. I draw on the world of many great western minds, including: Thoreau, Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, Sun Tzu, Epictetus, Jung, Aquinas, Fromm, James..\u2026 and as a Sanskrit theorist I draw on many of the ancient Vedic texts, the Mahabharata, The Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Upanishads, The Bengali poets and scholars, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the topics will be about yoga, science, meditation, philosophy, and basically all things that can be used to help us explore how to both think more clearly and at the same time reside happily in the cloud of unknowing.<\/p>\n<p>Each week I will offer a presentation about the topic that is no more than 17 minutes long.&nbsp;We will then have a discussion on the topic, and sharing time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>So, remember to bring something that inspires you to share. It can be a piece of music, a photo, a poem, or even a short anecdote.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>I will close the session with some brief remarks, and then go to brunch, or, if the weather is nice, on a picnic.

I speak four languages and can read and write Sanskrit. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in educational psychology. I am spiritual, but not religious. I am agnostic, but not atheistic. I am rational, but not close-minded. I am here to be of service to others. I like art, history, science, music, literature, and things that buzz or blink. I think coming together as a community on Sunday mornings has value, but I\u2019m not into church. I want to grow and learn in the company of my peers, and friends, free from the dictates of dogma and blue hair.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I have created Voki-all-joyo (phonetic for voki al \u011dojo.) This is Esperanto (one of my favorite languages) for Call to Joy. I named it this because I am convinced that our constitutional position as spirits in a human form is to be full of joy. I aIso feel strongly that clear thinking is the best path to real joy. Please note, when I say, \u2018be full of joy\u2019, I do not mean joy in some horribly homogeneous way, like a narcotized, monolithically emotional state. I mean joy, as in a rich state of appreciation and wonder at the mystery and beauty of life. (Like the feeling you get when you find a box of Twinkies in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland.)<\/p>\n<p>So, think of this as a pasta sea of fellow swimmers who are looking for what binds us together without being bound up by the ligaments of human speculation. Since perhaps, it is not so wise to hold dear that which is so dearly held by those who prefer not think for themselves:)<\/p>\n<p>Think clearly and be grateful <br>(Pensi klare kaj esti dankema)<\/p>\n<p><i>Atma<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Our club greeting: <\/b> <br>~ Ne estu schmuckie (Don\u2019t be a schmuck)<\/p>\n<p>~ Vi nek (You either)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/highres_442780987.jpeg","photo_id":442780987,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/600_442780987.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/thumb_442780987.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13673881,"name":"Atma Degeyndt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/highres_250316380.jpeg","photo_id":250316380,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/member_250316380.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/thumb_250316380.jpeg"}},"members":130,"name":"NYC Philosophy, Science, & Spirituality Meetup","id":19002525,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Philosophy-Science-Spirituality-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Clear Thinkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444165393000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"realestateagent","name":"Real Estate Agent","id":2027},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"realtors","name":"Realtors","id":16166},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-broker","name":"Real Estate Broker","id":22932},{"urlkey":"accountant","name":"Accountant","id":23654},{"urlkey":"home-loans-mortgages","name":"Home Loans, Mortgages","id":27516},{"urlkey":"mortgage-brokers","name":"Mortgage Brokers","id":32915},{"urlkey":"legal-professionals","name":"Legal Professionals","id":34082},{"urlkey":"attorneys","name":"Attorneys","id":71041},{"urlkey":"hard-money-lenders","name":"Hard Money Lenders","id":171805},{"urlkey":"bankers","name":"Bankers","id":1501312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Real-Estate-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"We are a dynamic and well connected networking group bringing together real estate brokers, accountants, bankers, title companies, investors, attorneys, and everyone who is active in the real estate industry in an effort to connect, exchange ideas, and join forces to build their respective businesses, skill-sets, networks, and perspectives.\n\nWhether you are just starting out in real estate and looking to learn, or are working on building long term business relationships and increasing business revenues, this Meetup is for YOU.\nMembership to our group is free.

I found that pregnancy is an experience that is as exciting as it is scary. And there is no better way to make it through this experience than finding support from other mothers. Through this group we can grow lasting friendships, share advice, and also organize future playdates. We can even get together to have a few mommy night out events, which I'm sure we will all need. I hope to have a new meetup each week in which we can get together to chat, attend workshops, and even have pampering events. This is a great way to make some friends if you are a first time mom without friends with kids and if you are new and would like to meet other expecting mothers.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":93745422,"name":"Anna Hassanah Avalone","photo":{"photo_id":118040752,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/1\/0\/member_118040752.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/1\/0\/thumb_118040752.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"New Mommies in Harlem","id":19003202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-Mommies-in-Harlem","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Social Mommies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444187665000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"wls","name":"Weight Loss Surgery","id":1615},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"bariatric-surgery","name":"Bariatric Surgery","id":17336},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-surgery-support-group","name":"Weight Loss Surgery Support Group","id":23312},{"urlkey":"before-and-after-weight-loss-surgery","name":"Before and After Weight Loss Surgery","id":23313},{"urlkey":"bariatric-support-group","name":"Bariatric Support Group","id":26199},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Union-Post-Op-Bariatric-Support-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for anyone who would like to share their experiences after weight loss surgery (lap band, sleeve, by pass).

Yes, there IS bias here because MWC members are highly capable in the many roles they pursue \u2013 which include: chefs, friends, bankers, teachers, quilters, artists, lawyers, parents, authors, doctors, musicians, agents, philanthropists, spouses, entrepreneurs, professors, caterers, accountants, designers, producers, historians, actresses and grandparents. And probably a few Indian chiefs, too! The MWC \u201cclubhouse\u201d is New York City and its immediate environs because of the infinite variety, diversity and scope New York offers in terms of extraordinary things to see and do.

I've been a resident of the Upper East side for a number of years, and I often find myself traveling out of my own neighborhood to meet up with friends all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice for me to come home after work and go to a happy hour locally or get out of bed on the weekend and not have to spend time commuting to meet friends for brunch downtown or on the west side of town.&nbsp; So I decided to create&nbsp;a group that caters to those of us between the age of 25-45 years of age who would like to get together&nbsp;for Happy Hours and Brunch events throughout the week and on the weekends. <br> <br>Happy Hour and Brunch events will be the main types&nbsp;of&nbsp;get togethers&nbsp;we will host initially, but&nbsp;my hope is to expand by sharing events hosted by other UES groups as well.&nbsp; This way you will have one place to find out about&nbsp;events, instead of having to join 50 meetup groups to keep on top of things on the UES.&nbsp; If you are an organizer of another group, please contact me and I would love to place your event on our calendar.&nbsp; My second goal is to set up potlucks, trips to other parts of the city and out of town, cooking classes, and other events to create a greater sense of community.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>As of April 1st 2016,&nbsp;look for all events in our calendar that say \"Living on the Upper East Side - Happy Hour and Brunch(HH+B)\" for get togethers that&nbsp;are hosted by our organizers.&nbsp; Our group events will never be more than 15-20 people, which should allow for diversity&nbsp;in the&nbsp;types of people you will meet but&nbsp;an event wont be&nbsp;too large that you will get lost in the crowd.&nbsp; We take your recommendations for favorite places in the area seriously, and hope to plan events based around your feedback.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you at one of our future events.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Living on the Upper East Side - Happy Hour and Brunch (HH+B)<\/p>\n<p>S.A.W.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>FAQ<\/p>\n<p>Why have I been waiting so long to be accepted in to your group?<\/p>\n<p>There could be a number of reasons.&nbsp;

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

Research show's that being a part of a community that shared your goals is integral to achieving them. Personally, I've always participated in team sports or activities like football, wrestling, rugby, and martial arts. What keeps me coming back and engaged is the community and camaraderie inherent in these group activities. Weightlifting is another matter though. I know my way around a gym, but lifting alone is difficult for me. The lack of accountability and engagement usually leads me to modifying routines that shouldn't be modified or abandoning lifting all together and focussing on my group activities (Currently Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). So my goal for this group is to find some more buddies who want to partner with me on lifting. I'm going to be on the program outlined in \"Man 2.0, Engineering the Alpha.\" This group is for guys like me, to find other guys like me, so that we can do this together! While I have a specific program that I want to engage, this group will serve as a hub for other guys in our situation to meet one another, find someone else who wants to engage in a program of your choosing and move onward!","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":42906772,"name":"Shane","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/highres_247885566.jpeg","photo_id":247885566,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/member_247885566.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/thumb_247885566.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"Personal Revolution Workout Buddies","id":19029933,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Personal-Revolution-Workout-Buddies","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Savages"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444920289000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"korean","name":"Korean Language","id":862},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"business-in-china","name":"Business in China","id":16053},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"mandarin-language","name":"Mandarin Language","id":51192},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584},{"urlkey":"asian-singles-30s-40s","name":"Asian Singles 30s 40s","id":96692},{"urlkey":"asian-americans-30s-40s","name":"Asian Americans 30s 40s","id":96694},{"urlkey":"chinese-language","name":"Chinese language","id":125467}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asian-NYC-Watching-Movies-Weekend-Events\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for Asians or anyone interested in joining movies and cultural events, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. I started this group because I am a big fan of cinema but I hate to go see a movie alone.

From a self-defense aspect it can end an attack suddenly, severely and decisively or dissipate it with the gentleness of a soft breeze. <\/p>\n<p> <br>Aikido's unique approach is to blend with an attack rather than clash with it. The attack is redirected safely away into a throw or pin. Its circular, flowing techniques are effective and can be learned by anyone regardless of size, age or gender. Men, women, children and seniors all find it appealing because Aikido techniques are not based on pitting one's strength against another's. Students learn to defend themselves without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Self esteem, concentration, awareness and focusing power are enhanced. Balance and calmness are therefore maintained in all situations. This state of being is then carried off the mat and into the activity and interactions of daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers was established in 1988 after Sensei O'Connor had been studying and teaching for 12 years. At Aikido Centers we teach traditional Aikido as handed down by Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers is the largest traditional Aikido dojo organization in New Jersey.

For example, a technique does not work by itself unless combined with the concepts of balance, power, speed, focus, timing, and attitude. When combining these elements, the outcome or whole is far more effective then what would normally be the sum of the parts. This is the reason techniques, as practiced in the system, are only tools used to understand, accept and retain these ideas. The number of different techniques mastered by an individual does not increase his level of competence in this system. Techniques are only practiced moves until combined with the proper fighting concepts. The ultimate goal of the martial arts is to make your mental, physical and technical skills work as one. The goal of Latosa Escrima is to do this while producing a quality Escrimador who can think creatively and react responsively rather than giving people information overload. Escrima was the original name used under the flag of the Philippine Martial Arts Society. The name changed to Combat Escrima as the system was influenced by the concept of using power and combat reality. Combat Escrima relied on a single goal; winning. This goal proved to be a very valuable asset. The intimidation factor of the name \"Combat Escrima\" was something the students felt they had to defend. However, just the goal of winning actually proved limiting in the progression of the system and future instructors. PMAS produced excellent fighters and world champions but failed to produce very many well-rounded instructors. PMAS had the box recipe for producing competent fighters but failed to isolate the individual ingredients that make up the end product. Latosa spent his time developing training methods used to understand the reasoning behind the techniques and isolating the concepts of Escrima. Wing Tzun is self defense in it's most consequent form Wing Tzun is the smartest self-defense system ever thought of by humankind, because Wing Tzun is not based upon physical strength or acrobatic ability and therefore allows a physically weaker person to defend him\/herself. Wing Tzun teaches you to use the force of the opponent and turn it against him. Wing Tzun self defense movements derive from tactile reflexes that are mechanical and directly determined by the attack of the opponent. In this way WT is not susceptible to optical manipulations meant to mislead the fighter. Wing Tzun can be learned fairly quickly and built upon.

Participants will learn how to develop their musicianship more quickly by utilizing modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam groups since 2010. &nbsp;The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the ABB. &nbsp;These sessions are a lot of fun. &nbsp;Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the ABB with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.&nbsp; Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.&nbsp; Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.&nbsp; Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. &nbsp;Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.&nbsp; Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN: <\/p>\n<p>The music of The Allman Brothers Band is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. &nbsp;However, learning the music of the ABB can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I can help you learn. &nbsp;This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the ABB played it. &nbsp;The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.&nbsp; I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.&nbsp; The charts are clear about song form,&nbsp;intros, &nbsp;chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.&nbsp; Both Duane Allman and Dicky Betts' parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In most cases, Berry Oakley's bass lines have been transcribed. &nbsp;The ABB shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose. <\/p>\n<p>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN: <\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord&nbsp;progressions and song&nbsp;forms; the actual chord voicings;&nbsp;specific chord progressions used during the improv sections; slide guitar techniques; pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;&nbsp;chord\/scale combinations; use of chromaticism; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation to improvise.&nbsp; There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.&nbsp; People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation. <\/p>\n<p>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. &nbsp;In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on many songs including: &nbsp; Staesboro Blues, Trouble No More, Don't Keep me Wonderin', Done Somebody Wrong, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Dreams, Blue Sky, Hot 'Lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Little Martha, Midnight Rider, Mountain Jam, Stormy Monday, Whipping Post, You Don't Love Me and others.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE COORDINATOR:<\/p>\n<p>I am a professional musician with over 40 years experience. I began playing the guitar at four years old and performing professionally at 15. &nbsp;I've performed all over the world at countless venues and festivals. &nbsp;Additionally, I teach privately and at a variety of music schools. &nbsp;As a performer and recording artist I play many styles of music including rock, blues, jazz and folk.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/highres_443233561.jpeg","photo_id":443233561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/600_443233561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_443233561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13972016,"name":"Luke Johnson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/highres_12000209.jpeg","photo_id":12000209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/member_12000209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/thumb_12000209.jpeg"}},"members":26,"name":"New York City Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam","id":19041096,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Allman-Brothers-Band-Song-and-Jam","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"ABB Jammers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445269204000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"programming-languages","name":"Programming Languages","id":17628},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Pluralsight-Study-group\/","rating":0,"description":"The Hoboken Pluralsight Study Group was started because we love the idea of the NYC Pluralsight Study Group, but we wanted something a bit easier to attend.

In this lively, interactive workshop, Robert Vetter deconstructs processes of spiritual healing found in cultures found all over the world, and shares a formula for healing that can be adapted to almost any energetic or spiritual healing discipline. By looking at the methods of other cultures, you will understand on a deeper level what healing is, how it works, and the ways that various healers master a universal code that underlies the healing process.\n\nWorkshop topics include:\n\n\u2022 Understanding your calling as a healer\n\u2022 Developing a healing presence\n\u2022 Respectfully borrowing healing practices from other cultures\n\u2022 Constructing altars to invoke the power of symbols in healing\n\u2022 Engaging all 5 senses in healing\n\u2022 Grasping a deeper meaning that underlies the wounded healer archetype\n\u2022 Methods of self-protection that you can implement in your practice\n\u2022 The power of narrative medicine: using words to heal\n\u2022 Acquiring healing energy\n\u2022 Soul retrieval and re-integration\n\nDuring this workshop, you will develop your own unique healing protocol that is a reflection of who you are on your individual journey. In learning to heal using this method, you will also uncover how healing is a spiritual path that directs us through the entire cycle of human life, imbuing it with meaning and purpose.\n\nRobert Vetter, M.A. is a cultural anthropologist, who began his studies of cross cultural healing practices at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980\u2019s. He has apprenticed and learned from a variety of teachers in modalities that include traditional Mesoamerican medicine (Curanderismo), Native North American medicine, and Medical or Healing Qigong among others. He maintains a healing practice in what he calls Ethno-Energetic Healing. He is the co-author (along with his adopted uncle, Kiowa medicine man, Richard Tartsah) of the book Big Bow: The Spiritual Life and Teachings of a Kiowa Family. He is vice president of Joshua\u2019s Place Center for Healing in Southampton, NY. He has taught at the New York Open Center, Wainwright House, Mount Madonna Center in the San Francisco Bay area, The Sanctuary at Mount Shasta, and many other venues.\n\nExchange: $65","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":72465082,"name":"Awakening NY","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/highres_246562844.jpeg","photo_id":246562844,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/member_246562844.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/thumb_246562844.jpeg"}},"members":24,"name":"Healing Spirituality As A Life Journey","id":19041709,"state":"NY","urlname":"Healing-Spirituality-As-A-Life-Journey","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Healers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445273477000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-health","name":"Women's Health","id":16973},{"urlkey":"natural-health","name":"Natural Health","id":17124},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"womens-support-group-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Support Group Health and Wellness","id":94489},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477},{"urlkey":"womens-sexual-health","name":"Women's Sexual Health","id":222511},{"urlkey":"women-health","name":"Women health","id":1407762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Premenstrual-Dysphoric-Disorder-PMDD-Support\/","rating":0,"description":"PMDD is more than a little bloating and cramping before a period. It is a mood disorder that accompanies the other premenstrual symptoms. The PMDD gets more severe as the period draws near, escalating the sufferer to a state of very high tension, anxiety and aggression. It enhances other coexisting mood disorders to complicate any treatment for several days during the month. PMDD is thought to be a brain chemistry malfunction that is triggered by ovulation. Symptoms usually begin after ovulation and last into the first days of the period. This cycle repeats itself every month. PMDD is tied to the hormonal changes triggered by ovulation, so it does not occur without this part of the menstrual cycle. The condition affects up to 8 percent of women. The condition involves much more than a bad time during a period. It is cyclical, occurring at the same point in the menstrual cycle each month. The symptoms of PMDD are severe and usually life altering. Doctors require sufferers to have at least five of the following symptoms to support a diagnosis: Depression of hopeless feelings Feelings of anxiousness, tension or edge Irritability that increases as period nears Oversleeping or insomnia Lack of interest in favorite things No motivation Loss of energy Difficulty focusing and concentrating Loss of control feelings, feeling overwhelmed Severe physical manifestation of PMS symptoms like tender breasts, cramping, bloating, muscle pain and weight gain Suicidal thoughts Source: http:\/\/www.psychguides.com\/guides\/living-with-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\/ Message from Organizer: Last year I learned that I have PMDD. The only thing I found that truly helps the mental aspect of PMDD is joining online forums where other women discuss their experiences with PMDD, thus learning that I am not alone. I am making this group so members can meet and give support to other PMDD suffers. I'm calling the members \"Lunar Girls\" because of how we're affected by our cycle, much like the moon. I thought about calling us werewolves but that seemed a bit extreme.

Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter. The Song Club is led by the founder of the Collective -Peter Bliss. The Collective Song Club\u201d will begin on October 14th and follow every other Wednesday evening (skipping the night before Thanksgiving). It will take place at Planet Studio NYC (www.planetstudionyc.com) 244 West 54th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue in Suite 800B on the 8th floor. It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like! There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage! The CSC is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see! Join us for our first session on October 14th and let\u2019s see what happens! Peter Bliss \/ Profile: Peter Bliss songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties. He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film.

FINALLY, a \" Meet Up\" for high functioning young adults living at home or a group home. I am specifically talking about the young people with disabilities that can do so much more socially and want to, but that their socialization some how ends at the programs they attend for various reasons. They do not have friends in the neighborhood, and want to \"fit in\" so badly but don't! Parents, I say ENOUGH, it's got to start with us! Please if you are as frustrated as I am, lets get together, and HELP! Lets help and brainstorm and make this happen! I personally, have a 32 yr old high functioning daughter at home, who is lucky enough to have a 34 yr. old sister who loves and adores her. But as we all know 'its not enough\"! These young people need friends, they need their peers! They need movie dates, bowling dates, parties to attend, or just taking turn hang out at each others house. Parents, as you have already found out the first step to help will always be family. I am looking for dedicated mothers, fathers, sisters , brothers or whoever that family member might consist of. If your plain tired and sad of seeing your grown young adult home alone on the entire weekend with no plans , no friends, or sitting in their room watching a funny movie alone then reach out and lets move forward together. It just begins with one or two of us to start a network of friends for are kids, then before you know it, they are no longer alone!<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/highres_241621249.jpeg","photo_id":241621249,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/member_241621249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/thumb_241621249.jpeg"}},"members":22,"name":"Socializing For High Functioning Young Adults in Westchester","id":19048902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Socializing-For-High-Functioning-Young-Adults","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"True Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445457886000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence","id":10538},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"qlikview","name":"Qlikview","id":60832},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-tools-and-technology","name":"Business Intelligence Tools and Technology","id":148287},{"urlkey":"tableau","name":"Tableau","id":168154},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"tableau-software","name":"Tableau Software","id":1433052},{"urlkey":"qlik-sense","name":"Qlik Sense","id":1505900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Qlikview-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone utilizing QlikView or&nbsp;Tableau&nbsp;on the BI Platform.

But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute. Yet paid care is out of reach for many. Please come down on November 17th to the New York Life building in Lake Success, NY and attend a free educational workshop on long term care and the many options that are available for us to avoid creating any future hardships for our family members Feel free to contact me for any further information 516-359-8696 Anyone interested in learning about long term care is welcome to join.

This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I took a basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen. The cost per guest is will be minimum donation of $40. As I said at the top, there\u2019s going to be delicious food, bottomless drinks, and music, all in a spacious apartment with a large terrace overlooking Central Park \u2013 perfect ingredients for a great time, especially when it\u2019s for a good cause!<\/p>\n<p>Here are some links to the gofundme page I started for Eagle Kindergarten, and Fanel's facebook page for the school:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj\">https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/882495101842616\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/88249510184...<\/a> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, you can take care of the donation when you arrive for the dinner on Saturday, or you can get it out of the way now and I'll take note of which guests have already donated prior to the event.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/highres_444080256.jpeg","photo_id":444080256,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/600_444080256.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/thumb_444080256.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194679069,"name":"David Mazzucchi","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/highres_250877642.jpeg","photo_id":250877642,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/member_250877642.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/thumb_250877642.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Fundraising dinner for Haitian school","id":19063602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Haiti-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fundraisers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445890957000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"accounting","name":"Accounting","id":378},{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"small-business-accounting","name":"Small Business Accounting","id":27267}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Tax-Accounting-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group will aid small business owners, self-employed individuals and those looking to venture out onto their own in learning fundamental Finance, Accounting and Tax concepts with the aid of skilled designated professionals.
