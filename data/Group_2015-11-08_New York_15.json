Our goal is to meet quarterly and offer valuable content delivered by interesting speakers; the movers, shakers and rising stars of the Long Island real estate investment scene. We will be talking about wholesaling, rehabbing, pre-habbing, short sales, REOs. We will invite successful investors, lawyers, accountants, contractors and others to speak about the topics which are important to us.

Interested in making money through real estate investing? Are you serious about getting a solid real estate education? Then consider the Metro Real Estate Investors Association. We are a merger of associations and can trace our roots all the way back to 1982! If you think that you can get rich quick, with not doing any work...you have been mislead. Please do not get ripped off by spending anywhere from $2,000 to as much as $25,000 for so-called real estate education or mentoring. Metro REIA is comprised of beginning and experienced investors. We present local speakers who offer education specific to New Jersey and who have a high level of expertise in various real estate related topics. Twice a year we sponsor National Speakers. And contrary to other organizations, we charge our members only $29 for an all-day workshop. Our members are VOLUNTEERS who enjoy giving back to other members their successes AND mistakes! Our mission is to provide solid real estate education to achieve financial independence. Each meeting also provides an opportunity for members to announce potential deals to others and there is also sufficient time for networking. For further information please visit www.mreia.com. You can click on Past Meetings\/Events to see the topics and speakers we presented going all the back to 1985! You can also click on UPCOMING MEETINGS to see the year's meeting schedule of topics. We also publish an e-newsletter every month which usually contains from 25 to 28 articles. It is the most comprehensive newsletter in the United States. And it gets even better: members can view any of the over 2500 articles going back to November 2002. Here are some of the topics we have explored in the past: Landlording, Lease\/Options\/Buying \"Subject to,\" Asset Protection, Entities, Creative Financing, Private Financing, Seller Financing, Dealmaking, Environmental Problems, Finding Deals, Selling Strategies, Wholesaling, Foreclosures, Insurance, Home Inspections, Renovation Tips, Legal Concerns, Marketing, Negotiating Strategies, Options, REO Properties, Short Sales, Self-Directed IRAs, Technology and Tax Reduction.

Location: Manhattan). Learn to articulate your value and values with ease, savvy, and style. Our attention spans are shorter. Our lives are busier. And our mental hard drives are at capacity. So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience. Workshop participants will be able to get on your feet, practice, and start to make some connections with other professionals. Post packet PDF included.
