In the spirit of this coalition we have launched a partnership with none other than the legendary New York City recording and rehearsal studio known as Funkadelic Studios.<\/p> <p>Funkadelic Studios is extremely supportive of our movement and has played host to our association this past May for the \"Gotham City Ganjafest\" event. We are so excited to be able to bring Funkadelic Studios back into the mix as the Launchpad for our coalition.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this event is to help inspire activism in the tri-state area. We at the CHA believe that lawful access to cannabis is a sacred right and to be deprived of it is unacceptable. That said, we also believe that people are generally \"scared\" of true, legitimate activism. The GrowUp.NYC coalition is not just about telling our oppressive leaders in the state to grow up, it's also about helping the passionate and talented people in the cannabis movement to legalize get more involved with the state. Together we hope to inspire more phone calls to public officials, lobbying efforts at the state houses, letters written, and meetings with our states legislature that are both credible and responsible. The CHA is very concerned that cannabis activists are perceived as mindless stoners by the media and our public officials due to the radical tactics of many in the movement. While civil disobedience can be fun and sometimes impactful, the stigmas we are left with as a community can be a setback to the patients in dire need of medical cannabis.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere\u00a0 is one simple rule for this event that\u00a0is very reasonable.<\/p> <p><b>Pipes, edibles,\u00a0and vapes only.<\/b> No bongs, rigs, joints, or blunts.

By the early 1860s, it had earned an international reputation for its magnificent beauty and became the prestigious place to be buried, attracting 500,000 visitors a year, second only to Niagara Falls as the nation\u2019s greatest tourist attraction. Crowds flocked there to enjoy family outings, carriage rides, and sculpture viewing in the finest of first generation American landscapes. Green-Wood\u2019s popularity helped inspire the creation of public parks, including New York City\u2019s Central and Prospect Parks.<\/p> <p>Green-Wood is 478 spectacular acres of hills, valleys, glacial ponds and paths, throughout which exists one of the largest outdoor collections of 19th- and 20th-century statuary and mausoleums. Four seasons of beauty from century-and-a-half-old trees offer a peaceful oasis to visitors, as well as its 560,000 permanent residents, including Leonard Bernstein, Boss Tweed, Charles Ebbets, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Horace Greeley, Civil War generals, baseball legends, politicians, artists, entertainers and inventors.<\/p> <p>A magnet for history buffs and bird watchers, Green-Wood is a Revolutionary War historic site (the Battle of Long Island was fought in 1776 across what is now its grounds), a designated site on the Civil War Discovery Trail and a registered member of the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary System\"<\/p> <p>We will meet at the Joppa\/Fallston Park &amp; Ride (I-95, 74.0mm) at 9am.

There, we will catch the R train on the subway out to the 25th Street Station in Brooklyn, then walk a generous block to the cemetery. We will return the same way, but many of you may want to get off the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop and walk across the bridge from Brooklyn into Manhattan for what is, I believe, the very best vantage point for the New York City skyline.<\/p> <p>Plan on returning to the Joppa\/Fallston Park &amp; Ride sometime between 8pm and 10pm, depending on if you stay for dinner and\/or sightseeing in the City.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/grave-friends\/events\/227450642\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":43200000,"name":"ROAD TRIP:  Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NYC","id":"227450642","time":1452952800000,"updated":1453058810000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1426578933000,"name":"Grave Friends of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":18507491,"urlname":"grave-friends","group_lat":39.2999992371,"who":"Foolish Mortals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"721 Broadway","name":"ITP","lon":-73.993671,"id":1325418,"state":"NY","lat":40.729291,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.44668245316,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452752850000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/4\/b\/600_445889515.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>On <b>Saturday January 16, 2016<\/b> <b>Wikimedia NYC<\/b> will celebrate <b>Wikipedia's 15th Birthday<\/b> with a<b> <a href=\"https:\/\/meta.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_15\/Events\/New_York_City\">miniconference<\/a><\/b>,\u00a0hosted by NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program at the Tisch School of the Arts, and also supported by the Free Culture Alliance NYC (including ISOC-NY).

We make some of our strongest commitments with them, depend upon them as we do no other, and are often willing to go the \u2018extra mile\u2019 for them.<\/p> <p>Our \u2018partners\u2019 can take different forms; they have been and can be a special plant and animal, as well as a human being. For the purpose of this class, we will be focusing on our human partners now.<\/p> <p>Carlos Castaneda\u2019s teacher, don Juan Matus, corroborates this unique union by describing energetically what happens between partners:<\/p> <p>\u2026 the emanations encased inside the cocoon of both partners undergo a profound agitation, the culminating point of which is a merging, a fusing of two pieces of their glow of awareness, one from each partner\u2026<\/p> <p>In other words, partnering creates a \u2018third\u2019 entity, whether that takes the form of a child, a binding philosophy, a shared appreciation, a lasting creative project, and\/or a common goal.<\/p> <p>Being in continuous, close proximity with another human being provides a wealth of opportunity for perceptual depth and growth.<\/p> <p>If we take the less conscious road of forming judgments, assumptions, and conclusions about our loved one, we build distance and remain in the cocoon of ourselves.<\/p> <p>If we practice acceptance of the ebbs and flows of our partner\u2019s journey, as well as our own, and remind ourselves that we both are on a\u00a0tour of awareness in this life\u00a0\u2013 of learning, expanding beyond our limitations, and exploring new avenues for change \u2013 then the \u2018we\u2019 we first formed can fully unfold.<\/p> <p>To take part in this class series, you need not be in a current relationship. It will be your choice to focus on a past or current partnership, knowing that what we process from our history, carries forward to our present and future.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s expand beyond our often narrow and confining view we have of our partners.

North Jersey Ramapo Chapter hikes are rated for pace (A, B or C), mileage, and terrain (A, B or C), with \"C\" designating easier hikes and \"A\" more challenging ones. We recommend that new hikers should first try a \"C\" or short \"B\" hike before undertaking a more difficult one; otherwise, you may not fully enjoy the hiking experience. If you have any doubts, please contact the hike leader in advance.<\/p> <p><b><i>Pace Ratings: <\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Fast - 2.5 mph or faster<br\/>B = Moderate - about 2 mph<br\/>C = Easy - 1.5 mph or less<\/p> <p><b><i>Distance: <\/i><\/b>Noted in miles<\/p> <p><b><i>Terrain Ratings:<\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Strenuous, long\/steep climbs and descents, possible rock scrambling<br\/>B = Moderate climbs and descents<br\/>C = Generally flat with little elevation change<\/p> <p>For example, a hike rated \u201cB 7 A\u201d is a moderately paced hike of approximately 7 miles with steep climbs and\/or descents and possible rock scrambling.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike, please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness, including ensuring that the hike is appropriate for your level of fitness, that you wear the proper clothing, and bring the proper gear, food and water (see the ADK's recommended <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adk.org\/page.php?pname=hiking-essentials\"><b>Hiking Essentials<\/b><\/a> and guidelines, below).<\/p> <p>Leaders have the right, responsibility and sole discretion to refuse any hiker he\/she deems to be not properly attired, prepared, or otherwise fit to safely complete the hike.<\/p> <p><b>HIKERS' GUIDELINES:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Risks:<\/i> As with all physical activities, hiking involves hazards. Persons participate at their own risk and will be asked to sign a statement acknowledging that fact before starting the hike. Prior to the hike please advise the leader of any medical condition or physical impairment that could affect you during the hike.<\/p> <p><i>Footwear and Clothing:<\/i> Wear clothing suited to the weather and carry extra garments for unexpected weather conditions. Dress in thin layers so that you can adjust the number of layers as required to maintain comfort. In winter carry a wool cap and wool or polypropylene gloves or mitts and a windproof shell. Be prepared for rain. Bring a rain jacket and rain pants, preferably of the type that permits venting body moisture. Wear comfortable, sturdy boots\/shoes. Do not wear cotton garments in winter.<\/p> <p><i> Drink and Food: <\/i> Adequate hydration is important year round. Drink frequently during the hike. Carry food to enjoy during the midday lunch stop.<\/p> <p><i>Other responsibilities:<\/i> Hikers with children under 16 and new hikers are required to contact the hike leader in advance to determine if the hike is suitable for them. Minors under 16 are welcome on day hikes when accompanied by a parent or guardian. No person under 18 shall participate in overnight outings unless accompanied by a parent or adult sponsor over 21. The hike leader may refuse to allow a person to hike who is judged to be poorly equipped or unable to do the published hike. Participants should get to the hike at least 10 minutes prior to the starting time.<\/p> <p><i> Maps: <\/i> The TC number indicates a NY-NJ Trail Conference map for the area of the hike.

Make sure you bring your binoculars and a camera to maximize your experience. Weather appropriate hiking clothing (layers; no cotton) and waterproof footwear (if possible) are highly recommended. You may even want to bring a small day pack with extra clothes, lunch, snacks, water and any personal medications you may need. Ages 8 and up are welcome. The parking area is small, so carpooling is highly recommended. If the parking area is full, more parking can be found by the nearby A&amp;P shopping center, which is only a short walk away.

We develop concentration and mindfulness as we focus on the other perfections, but we open our hearts and minds with Loving Kindness practice and are reminded that we are all connected and interdependent.<\/p> <p>I once heard Loving Kindness defined as \u201cunstoppable friendliness,\u201d which expresses to me our wish for less suffering and more happiness for others and ourselves. When we hold kindness in our hearts, it also makes it more difficult to feed anger and act from anger.\u00a0 That is why we can feel more confidence that there is a place of rest and peace available to us.<\/p> <p>In formal Loving Kindness practice we offer repeated phrases that express our unstoppable friendliness to a widening circle of beings, but we begin with offering friendliness and kindness to ourselves. \u00a0We then wish others well in ever widening circles - of benefactors, close friends, neutral people in our lives, even difficult people in our lives, then to all beings.\u00a0 The phrases are simple, but living them directly and earnestly in meditation opens our hearts and awakens our minds.<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

In addition, there are a few architectural wonders and places of historic interest we will see as well throughout our journey. There will be plenty of surprises along the way. I plan on hopefully finishing up somewhere near 27th Street on the West Side and there may be an optional visit to the new Hudson Yards Subway Station at 34th Street where we can talk very very briefly about the design of the station-unless you just can\u2019t take it any more. (We visited the new subway station recently but the only reason I plan on going there this time is because that\u2019s the station I will use to get home if the #7 is running!).\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Please consider joining the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/<\/a> The Club offers many hikes, walks and events and is also active in conservation efforts and trail maintenance. Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.<\/p> <p>Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC Club members to RSVP for this-UNLESS \u2013you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails (Contact me \u2013don\u2019t post a comment-if you are a dues paying member a few days before the hike and I\u2019ll tell you how to get these e-mails). Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. (I am going to give preference to those who have attended hikes I have led in the past.).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any of the previous AMC Meetup events that I have led or you abuse the RSVP process-see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event. Unfortunately your ship has sailed.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See Accuweather like I do, I will post a notice Saturday morning by 10:00 A.M. (If it\u2019s really really cold, we can spend a little more time in the galleries and shorten the hike.) If there is no notice, we go. We will finish before 5:30 P.M.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/227898802\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Lower  East Side\/Soho\/The Village\/ Chelsea Expedition including a  Gallery Hop.","id":"227898802","time":1452967200000,"updated":1453003537000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351543614000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club New York-North Jersey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":5616472,"urlname":"Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"AMC Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"212-444-8276","address_1":"590 Madison Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets","name":"IBM ATRIUM","lon":-73.97,"id":264609,"state":"NY","lat":40.76,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.256726861,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449765593000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/3\/e\/600_331094142.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Most of us have some sense of our strengths &amp; gifts, but this workshop will help you gain deep clarity as to what they are and how to bring them to the world, unlocking your hidden potential.

It is a great way to meet new players and improve your skills at the same time. \u00a0It is an absolutely unbelievable deal!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>***Please note- RSVP'g on Meetup will not reserve your spot.\u00a0Please go to our website to sign up.*** A credit card payment is required to reserve your space.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/nyurban.com\/open-play-registration-vb\/?filter_id=1&amp;gametypeid=1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nyurban.com\/open-play-registration-vb\/?filter_id=1&amp;gametypeid=1<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/3\/4\/event_198656372.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/4\/4\/event_198112292.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYURBAN-Volleyball\/events\/227704531\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"SATURDAY AFTERNOON OPEN PLAY\/CLINIC (Beginner\/Adv Beg & Intermediate)","id":"dbsbnlyvcbvb","time":1452968100000,"updated":1452981050000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1352757933000,"name":"NY URBAN PROFESSIONALS VOLLEYBALL LEAGUE","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":5817922,"urlname":"NYURBAN-Volleyball","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Volleyball Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1000 Fifth Avenue","name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","lon":-73.962343,"id":1047201,"state":"NY","lat":40.7789,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":2.47106337547,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452566088000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f, \u041f\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0441 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c 2016 \u0413\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c!<br\/>\u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0451\u043c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0430.<br\/>\u041c\u044b \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 Alex Katz, Faberg\u00e9 from the Matilda Geddings Gray Foundation Collection, Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Russian-Brooklyn\/events\/228023329\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","id":"228023329","time":1452969000000,"updated":1453075873000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1149110392000,"name":"The 4th Ave Brooklyn Russian Language Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":255797,"urlname":"Russian-Brooklyn","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Russian Speakers in Brooklyn"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn ","address_1":"Tillary St and Cadman Plaza W ","name":"Cadman Plaza (Turf Fields) ","lon":-73.99128,"id":15573482,"state":"NY","lat":40.696358,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":3.71463751793,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1430809427000,"fee":{"amount":4,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a co-ed adult pick-up game 6v6 or 7 v7 depending on attendance. 90 minutes with two 45 minute halves.\u00a0No slide tackling or rough play.\u00a0We play with Pugg goals.

Let's make this one an extraordinary one:).<\/p> <p>We did this meetup last year and it was a hit. The Venue is a beautiful, upscale, well maintained, and trendy, place to bowl, play pool, or arcade games, or sit in the lounge and have a drink.<\/p> <p><br\/>You can enter on 9th ave or the entrance inside Port Authority..<\/p> <p>You can click the link for more info here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.framesnyc.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.framesnyc.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.framesnyc.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.framesnyc.com\">The idea is that everyone gets to bowl at least 2 games so we don't want to have too many women on each lane.<\/a><\/p> <p>Here is how the pricing goes:\u00a0 They charge $60 per lane per hour and $7 per pair of bowling shoes.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0If we rent the lanes for 2\u00a0 for 3 hours, it will take forever to get up to bowl your turn, so I am thinking of renting 3 lanes, for 2 hours.<\/p> <p>I have to put the entire rental on my credit card before we arrive, order to reserve the lanes for us. I did this last year and\u00a0 22 women rsvpd and 13 showed up. It was a bit confusing.<\/p> <p>The cost to you will be determined by how many women show up..<\/p> <p>Figure around $15 to bowl plus $7 for shoes approximately.<\/p> <p><br\/>I will reserve only 2 lanes to start, as the number of RSVP's increase, I can always ADD a lane,\u00a0 But I cannot subtract once I reserve .<\/p> <p>So, I'm asking in all earnest, PLEASE RSVP ONLY IF YOU ARE 98 PERCENT CERTAIN YOU WILL\u00a0 MAKE IT.<\/p> <p>Since I am putting money down up front, it is critical that I don't end up paying out of my pocket.<\/p> <p>This is a fun, and lively way to talk, and to meet new people.<\/p> <p>Let's have fun, if you are a beginner, or you are a pro, join us for a fun afternoon.<\/p> <p>If you want to arrive early\u00a0 and utilize the arcade, or the billiard tables, I would do that before 2, or if you just want to come and play pool, make sure you have a partner to do so with.<\/p> <p>Food and drinks are extra. A few of us may go to grab a bite afterwards but no reservations are being made, we can play it by ear. Last year the group went to Tavola Restaurant on 10th ave. We can go there or to another place.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nLets meet, have fun, and start the new year and be social,<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI look forward to seeing at least 20 of you on Saturday.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHugs,<\/p> <p>xxx<\/p> <p>Carly<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lesbians-50-plus-Active-in-the-City\/events\/227738797\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"name":"Let's Go Bowling! at the Upscale and Trendy Frames Bowling Lanes","id":"227738797","time":1452970800000,"updated":1453018708000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1386362351000,"name":"Lesbians 45 + Active in the City","group_lon":-74,"id":11366862,"urlname":"Lesbians-50-plus-Active-in-the-City","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Activity Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"37 W 26th St, 9th Floor","name":"Stepping Out Studios","lon":-73.990433,"id":7003382,"state":"NY","lat":40.744415,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.387497574091,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421726117000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Rawson is for all levels of experience in Argentine tango.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Do \"white lies\" indirectly or directly contribute or take away from your happiness levels? Why? Do each of us tend to lie to ourselves, and if so, why would we do so from the perspective of happiness? How and why do people, whether that include you or not, consciously or subconsciously seek out truth?

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Do \"white lies\" indirectly or directly contribute or take away from your happiness levels? Why? Do each of us tend to lie to ourselves, and if so, why would we do so from the perspective of happiness? How and why do people, whether that include you or not, consciously or subconsciously seek out truth?

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Fischler from the New York Times covered our first girls night out event.<\/p> <p>Click here<\/p> <p>for the full article. Some excerpts from the article include:<\/p> <p>\"The hardest thing is to establish a circle of friends, a circle of single people,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"The idea of having a fun time for myself and meeting single women is very attractive. It takes away the scariness of doing the single thing, and puts a fun element in it.\"<\/p> <p>\"As the friends they have known from young adulthood commit to relationships, marry and have children, single women in their 30's, 40's and 50's, especially in the suburbs, often find themselves out of the loop. Tagging along with couples becomes awkward, and the common ground of shared experience dwindles. The single friend may feel stuck in a rerun of \"Sex and the City\" while the married friend has moved on to the Wisteria Lane of \"Desperate Housewives.\"<\/p> <p>\"A lot of women my age are married or have kids,\" Dr. Hughes said. \"They are just on a different path in their lives. They are not interested in going out or doing anything with the singles scene. I am still looking to go out, to meet men.\"<\/p> <p>Not only would they have a chance to commiserate with other unattached women over fresh fruit, sushi and cucumber water, they would also choose from a menu of pampering treatments, from mini-facials to professional makeup applications, having their hair blown out and attending a group lesson on skin care.<\/p> <p>Afterward, relaxed, primped and perhaps bonded, the 18 women would move straight on to the more traditional half of the double-barreled event: a men-and-women singles party at Cirella's, a restaurant in the mall.<\/p> <p>\"Meeting women and men - it's a good two options,\" Ms. Cardenas said. \"Doing the spa thing, if all goes wrong, you walk away with your facial. If all goes right, you make some new friends. If it goes extremely well, you walk out with a potential guy's phone number or being asked your phone number.\"<\/p> <p>At singles events for men and women, Dr. Hughes said, she often got \"that standoffish thing\" from other women. So the women-only mixer at the spa was a refreshing change, a chance to be cohorts instead of rivals. \"In this kind of situation, it's a lot more relaxed,\" she said.<\/p> <p><br\/>Contact us now at (516)[masked] or (718)[masked] with any questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Single-Over-40-and-Ready-For-Fun\/events\/227743734\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"girls night out- make new friends","id":"227743734","time":1452985200000,"updated":1452997255000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1275162679000,"name":"Greater NYC and Long Island Over 40 and Ready For Fun","group_lon":-73.6699981689,"id":1653073,"urlname":"NYC-Single-Over-40-and-Ready-For-Fun","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Potential New Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11756","country":"us","city":"Levittown","address_1":"90A Division Avenue","name":"Governors Comedy Club","lon":-73.527809,"id":2118331,"state":"NY","lat":40.725788,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":24.3040046692,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451949832000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/1\/2\/600_445649970.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Tables for Show arranged by Age groups <\/b><\/p> <p><b>MEET AT *6:15PM C ages 44-56 &amp; D - 57-69 introductions before 7pm show <\/b><\/p> <p><b>MEET AT *9PM A ages 23-34 &amp; B - 35-46 (lounge area) meet before 9:30pm show <\/b><\/p> <p><b>When you arrive, open mingle introductions and passed hors d'oeuvres.

Some of them happen to be single. And a lot of us are always complaining about how we never meet anyone decent to date. Let's get together and do what works when it comes to dating -- meeting people through friends and seeing immediately if there's chemistry.<\/p> <p>Our fantastic EWNYC members will review all the great single friends we know and invite a few of them to join us for an evening of fun. Doesn't matter who they are, there is only one criteria that they need and that's to be completely single. The great thing is that these are people whose 100% awesomeness can be vouched for -- none of us are friends with serial killers, right? It's not mandatory but you should probably be single also, you might make a connection here of your own.<\/p> <p><b>The Rules ...<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to keep the ratio of the sexes somewhat even, we do not want to discourage members from attending if they do not have a friend to come with. For example, if your friends, coworker, gym buddy and lunch mate is busy simply come. Will be your single friend<\/p> <p>There are no age restrictions regarding the friends you can bring. EWNYC has members of all ages and who are we to stand in the way of the blossoming of a May-December romance.<\/p> <p>If you would like to attend you cannot bring a friend you must come alone. Please contact the organizer. We are a friendly group and enjoy the time in this intimate setting. The organizer needs a single friend (contact her she is on the rsvp list)<\/p> <p>A list will be created of all attendees so when RSVP'ing. If you are not able to attend, change your rsvp and do not keep others from attending<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Spread The Word ...<\/b><\/p> <p>I emailed the idea for this event to a few select friends and you would be amazed at how many liked the idea and would like to attend.

In this dynamic, interactive evening combining individual work with group process, you will learn techniques to liberate this energy and access more pleasure in your life. These techniques will be demonstrated through individual body readings with select participants who choose to take the risk of revealing a sexual issue and are willing to work through it in a supportive environment with expert guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid uses the teachings of Integral Evolutionary Tantra and the principles of Core Energetics to open up physical blocks and places where life energy doesn\u2019t move. In Integral Evolutionary Tantric teachings and in Core Energetics -- a powerful body-based process -- sexual energy and life force energy are one and the same. Join us with body readings, deep truth, wild goodness, radical personal transformation and, if you dare, the evolution of your own personal enlightenment.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i><b>Note:<\/b>\u00a0This workshop is for both couples and singles.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

Because if you can\u2019t converse, your partner(s) are going to be upset with you, hee hee. :)<\/p> <p><b>READING\/WRITING REQUIREMENTS: <\/b><br\/>* You must already read\/write at a BEGINNER or higher level.<br\/>(Beginner = can survive in the country if you could not speak any other language)<br\/>* Why so low? Because this is mostly an individual activity, so your level will not impact others too much. \u00a0It's up to you how you feel about reading advanced texts.<\/p> <p><b>OTHER REQUIREMENTS:<\/b><br\/>* You need a smartphone or tablet with wifi capability.<br\/>* You need to bring earphones.<br\/>* You need one or two books\/magazines you are reading, plus any grammar or vocabulary references you like to use.<br\/>* You need to agree to speak your target language 98% of the time. \u00a0You CANNOT be lazy.<br\/>* You need to bring a notebook.<br\/>* You need to bring pencils with a good eraser OR erasable pens. \u00a0You will NOT be allowed to write your essay with normal pens OR on a computer.<br\/>* You need to agree to stay for the entire event.<br\/>* You need to agree to faithfully participate in all events to the best of your ability.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> $125.<\/p> <p><b>Why:<\/b> You get TWELVE HOURS of forced fluency practice, including a live native speaker (for one hour) who will also correct your writing exercises; plus intensive writing practice, intensive speaking practice, intensive listening practice, and intensive reading practice\u2014ALL WITHIN VERY SMALL GROUPS OF 2 \u2013 3 PEOPLE THAT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO WORK. You will learn more in this one day than you could in an entire five-week language course AND it is far less expensive! You will leave this advanced intensive with better reading skills, writing skills, listening skills, and speaking skills\u2014GUARANTEED\u2014or your money back* (*See refund policy below). So THAT\u2019S what you\u2019re paying for. As a bonus, you will also meet others who are just as serious about language learning as you are, and hey, that\u2019s always a good thing. Designed by a world-traveling language junkie PhD Psychology student (3 months from graduation) who truly understands what it takes to become fluent. This will be a day filled with joyfully fun and abundantly serious language mastery lessons that will stay with you for the rest of your life.<\/p> <p><b>For Who: <\/b>For someone (like you?) who is unequivocally serious about finally devoting the time and effort towards becoming fluent in your chosen foreign language. This one-day intensive is as intense (and probably more so) than an advanced foreign language course at university. This course will force you to do the sometimes boring and always difficult exercises and activities that you NEED to do in order to master a foreign language. During these very intensive 12 hours, you will be FORCED to read, write, speak, and listen, in a fun (but organized and firm) environment that leads to guaranteed results. You will also be treated to a 30-minute speech by a native speaker, speaking at normal speed. A native speaker (or language expert) will also be there to correct your 750-word written essay, so you will leave knowing where you made your mistakes.<\/p> <p><b>WARNING:<\/b> this course is not for lazy people and NOT for beginners. It WILL be exhausting; it WILL be tiring; and that's good because directly as a result, it WILL end up being (quite probably) the most practical and useful foreign language course you have ever experienced. All in just one day. \u00a0Pretty awesome if I say so myself, and yup, I'll be participating too!<\/p> <p><b>REFUND POLICY: <\/b><br\/>* At least two students are required for each language. If you end up being the only one who wishes to study a particular language, you will be given a full refund.<br\/>* If you pay, show up, but a partner does not show up, you will be given a refund, and also a $25 discount towards the next event.<br\/>* You will NOT be given a refund if you simply cancel after paying--others are counting on your being there, so you need to commit. This policy is my way to help ensure that it is more likely you will attend. If there is a serious medical or family emergency, please provide a note from your doctor or other official verifying this fact. Otherwise, I suggest you just attend (haha) or transfer your registration to a friend who speaks the same language (with our permission). Please try to respect your fellow students (and me!) who are counting on you being there.<br\/>* If you pay, but on the day of the immersion, simply do not show up, you will NOT be given a refund because others were counting on you to be their language partners.<br\/>* If you pay, attend the event, and participate in all exercises and then truly feel the course did not improve your language skills in any measurable way, you will be given a full refund. However, before paying, you agree to read the course description above in full, and fully acknowledge that this is not a traditional language class\u2014much of the work will be forced solitary or group practice. Do NOT attend this course if you expect to be spoon fed everything. One of the main purposes of this program is to force intermediate and advanced students to do the things they typically do not do by themselves on a regular basis. \u201cAll we did is read and write and talk to one another and listen to audio\u201d is not a valid reason for \u201cnot meeting your expectations\u201d\u2014um, that is precisely the purpose of this course and precisely what will help develop your fluency!

From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it.

This program features a new commission by the Breton composer Simon Frisch, a song cycle exploring the legacy of historic French queen (twice over)<b> Anne of Brittany<\/b> (1477 - 1514). As the last duchess of an independent Brittany, and a ferocious diplomat and patron of the arts, she surpassed her circumstances to live a life of enormous consequence for Europe. The cycle traces the arc of Anne's coercion into the French crown and legendary forty-day funeral, and ruminates on her embodiment, even centuries later, of the resilient spirit of the Breton. The texts, infused with chilling winds, sea salt, flora, violence, and mourning, are drawn from her court, funeral rites, and contemporary Anglo-Breton poet Claire Tr\u00e9vien. Interspersed are dances and Baroque court music of <b>Couperin and Lully<\/b>, guided with narration of Anne's life and influence. There will also be a fabulous motet by Anne's court composer <b>Jean Mouton<\/b>.<\/p> <p><br\/>The church will be illuminated with projections by artist Rachel Libeskind<\/p> <p><br\/>There are several French texts (14th\/15th)\u00a0set to music in the program, as well as the eloquent titles for the baroque composer Couperin's suite Apoth\u00e9ose de Lully. there is Renaissance music from her court as well: a processional to launch the event, and a motet written for Anne's funeral.<\/p> <p>the narration itself will be in English (for audience\u00a0accessibility).<\/p> <p>Video New Vintage Baroque - interview and music \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rN4thgyG3Oc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rN4thgyG3Oc&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a> \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-Valley-French-Language-Culture-Meetup\/events\/227945979\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"SPECIAL CONCERT MEETUP","id":"227945979","time":1453068000000,"updated":1453231561000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1244058209000,"name":"Hudson Valley French Language & Culture Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1466221,"urlname":"Hudson-Valley-French-Language-Culture-Meetup","group_lat":41.0999984741,"who":"Francophones & Francophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07033","country":"us","city":"Kenilworth","address_1":"14 Michigan Avenue","name":"Wildpig Comics","lon":-74.286171,"id":16236662,"state":"NJ","lat":40.676754,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3489341736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449784327000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>**** Both Groups are currently full, anyone that signs up, will have to be put on a wait list, thank you for your cooperation....

A graduate of the French Culinary Institute, Columbia University\u2019s Culinary Anthropology program, a James Beard House Invited Chef and voted by her peers as a Best Chef in America (less than 1% of chefs win this award), Melissa\u2019s love and devotion towards her Italian roots shines in her 23 rated Zagat restaurant. At Eolo, food is thought to be a source of great pleasure as well as an insight into the culture of Sicily. In a warm and relaxed setting, Eolo serves Sicilian-inspired contemporary fare in a comfortable setting with on-point staff, whose deep-rooted Italian manager happens to be a close friend.

This food is delicious, light and extraordinary.<\/p> <p>What about the lack of utensils? YOU have utensils - the best possible - your fingers. The injera is made from teff flour, the smallest grain out there. It's super nutritious and protein packed. Let's let Wikipedia do what they do best: \"In making injera, teff flour is mixed with water and allowed to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermentation_(food)\">ferment<\/a>\u00a0for several days, as with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sourdough\">sourdough<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bread_starter\">starter<\/a>. As a result of this process, injera has a mildly sour taste. The injera is then ready to be\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baking\">baked<\/a>\u00a0into large, flat\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pancake\">pancakes<\/a>. This is done either on a specialized electric stove or, more commonly, on a clay plate (Amharic\u00a0<i>mittad<\/i>, Tigrinya\u00a0<i>mogogo<\/i>) placed over a fire. Unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread, the dough has sufficient liquidity to be poured onto the baking surface, rather than rolled out. In terms of shape, injera compares to the French\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cr%C3%AApe\">cr\u00eape<\/a>\u00a0and the Indian\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dosa\">dosa<\/a>\u00a0as a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flatbread\">flatbread<\/a>\u00a0cooked in a circle and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the cr\u00eape and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Appam\">appam<\/a>. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a relatively smooth texture, while the top will become porous.

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life. If you can find a way to slow down and live more mindfully, you are well on the way to being an agent of joy and serenity in your own life and the lives of those living around you.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"A or 1 Trains to 190th Street, south entrance to the church.

For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Tracy Morgan, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>Host: Jonathan Randall, Mark Normand (Conan, Last Comic Standing), Gina Brillon (Comedy Central), Kyle Grooms (Comedy Central), Greer Barnes (HBO), Ryan Reiss (Conan), Yannis Pappas (Comedy Central) and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander. Last few meetups Jay Pharaoh From SNL dropped by I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup.

Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing.

If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/227686295\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflyvcbwb","time":1453078800000,"updated":1453152894000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!
