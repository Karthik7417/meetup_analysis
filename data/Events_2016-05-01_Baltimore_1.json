His current work focuses on Picornaviruses, a group of viruses with a wide range of hosts and a replication mechanism that leads to high mutation rates. The mutation rate results in tremendous genetic diversity that makes it difficult for hosts to develop resistance, allowing Picornaviruses to have severe effects on bee colonies. A well-known example of a virus within this group is the Deformed Wing Virus, which causes developmental deformities and is spread in honeybees by the Varroa destructor mite, which are external parasites of the . Dr. Boncristiani\u2019s current research is examining a phenomenon known as \u2018Black Muscle Bees\u2019, in which the muscle tissue of symptomatic bees is entirely black compared to the pink tissue of healthy bees. In his talk, he will discuss basic concepts of virology and use data from his published and on-going research to describe how viruses affect beehives. Dr. Boncristiani received his Masters and PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology at Sao Paulo University in Brazil. He began his research on honeybee viruses as a postdoctoral associate at the USDA Bee Research Laboratory, and continued working on this subject at the University of North Carolina and at the Chemical and Biological Defense Laboratory as a National Council Research Fellow.<\/p> <p><b>Meet for Dinner before the Lectures<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in meeting for dinner before the lectures, you are invited to join the guest speaker and your fellow MES members at Kibby\u2019s Restaurant and Lounge, \u201cHome of Baltimore\u2019s Best Shrimp Salad Sandwich.\u201d Kibby\u2019s is located inside the Baltimore Beltway at 3450 Wilkens Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21229, just 15 minutes from UMBC.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at&lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0Hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Head towards the water taxi stop near the UA campus.

Be prepared for muddy trail conditions!<\/p> <p>BTW, don't bring Fido if you want to walk with the SHR group! Although the event allows dogs after 10:00 am, we don't welcome them at SHR events because they are a major distraction from the human socialization we aim to achieve.<\/p> <p>Here's the Scenic Rivers Land Trust event notice:<\/p> <p><br\/><i>We're excited to once again (partnering with AAC Dept. of Recreation and Parks) host a day of guided hikes and public access to the Bacon Ridge Natural Area, which is County owned but currently not completely open to the public. We hope you can join us for a great, relaxing day of enjoying our local woods! Like in years past, we will have a variety of guided hikes, including bird watching, mushroom hunting, amphibian finding, and naturalist hikes scheduled throughout the day. In addition to going on some hikes, get your hands dirty while digging for archaeological treasures and check out the artifcfats on display. \u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Come for as long or as short as you like, go on a guided hike or wander through the trails on your own.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Free admission!\u00a0Donations are welcomed, and will support Scenic Rivers Land Trusts work, which is to protect the natural and scenic landscapes in Anne Arundel County. Donations are fully tax deductible.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>A little bit of information about the area: These will be unpaved trails, and often very hilly terrain. Parking will be on a very grassy field. Dogs are welcomed\u00a0AFTER 10am, but they need to stay on a leash.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Location address: Farm Road, Crownsville, MD 21032 (Good for GPS. Follow Farm Road to registration)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Directions: Take Generals Highway to Crownsville Road. Turn right on Marbury Road (within 1\/4 mile of Generals Hwy).

Memories of himself as a young man, tossed by fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Memories of a world filled with freaks and clowns, with wonder and pain and anger and passion; a world with its own narrow, irrational rules, its own way of life, and its own way of death. The world of the circus: to Jacob it was both salvation and a living hell. Jacob was there because his luck had run out-orphaned and penniless, he had no direction until he landed on this locomotive \"ship of fools.\" It was the early part of the Great Depression, and everyone in this third-rate circus was lucky to have any job at all. Marlena, the star of the equestrian act, was there because she fell in love with the wrong man, a handsome circus boss with a wide mean streak. And Rosie the elephant was there because she was the great gray hope, the new act that was going to be the salvation of the circus; the only problem was, Rosie didn't have an act-in fact, she couldn't even follow instructions. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and ultimately, it was their only hope for survival. Surprising, poignant, and funny, Water for Elephants is that rare novel with a story so engrossing, one is reluctant to put it down; with characters so engaging, they continue to live long after the last page has been turned; with a world built of wonder, a world so real, one starts to breathe its air.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll have a small sign that reads \"Baltimore City Book Club\"","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-City-Book-Club\/events\/229770005\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Let's meetup and discuss Water for Elephants: A Novel by Sara Gruen","id":"229770005","time":1460829600000,"updated":1460842169000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1414187840000,"name":"Baltimore City Book Club","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":17841902,"urlname":"Baltimore-City-Book-Club","group_lat":39.3300018311,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21032","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Crownsville","address_1":"1450 Generals Hwy","lon":-76.595604,"phone":"301-221-6517","name":"Anne Arundel County Fairgrounds","id":683632,"state":"MD","lat":39.024757,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":18.4106044769,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457446589000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/a\/8\/600_447644712.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/e\/1\/600_447644769.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Having FUN outdoors with live music, beer, and the best wings in Annapolis is a great combo for celebrating the arrival of spring.

History is reflected throughout the park, with its simple headstones, mournful statues and stately monuments adorned with handcrafted figures and funerary urns.<\/p> <p>Over 2,300 Union soldiers and more than 600 Confederate soldiers are buried in Loudon Park. The park is also the resting place of Mary Pickersgill, seamstress of the flag that flew over Fort McHenry during its bombardment by the British in1814. This famous flag inspired the writing of Francis Scott Key\u2019s \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d<\/p> <p>Also of note is the Weiskittel mausoleum\u2014constructed of cast iron and painted silver\u2014which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Two veterans gardens, Garden of Military Honor and Valor Hill, serve as lasting memorials for those who fought for their country. Maiden Choice Run is another highlight of the cemetery. It is a beautiful contemporary area featuring community mausoleums, crematory and columbarium, and garden crypts. Loudon Park has been designed for expansion far into the future and will continue to combine over 150 years of service with the latest concepts in burial.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/grave-friends\/events\/229628471\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":10800000,"name":"Loudon Park Cemetery","id":"229628471","time":1460829600000,"updated":1460919658000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1426578933000,"name":"Grave Friends of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":18507491,"urlname":"grave-friends","group_lat":39.2999992371,"who":"Foolish Mortals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"5120 South Street (Avalon Pavillion #105)","name":"Patapsco Valley State Park","lon":-76.61219,"id":24444330,"state":"MD","lat":39.290386,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.419541269541,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456579720000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please join the Navigators Scouting group for a wheel chair and stroller accessible trail at Patapsco Valley State Park. \u00a0Meet in the Orange Grove Area across from the swinging bridge. \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/dnr2.maryland.gov\/publiclands\/Documents\/Patapsco_Avalonmap.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dnr2.maryland.gov\/publiclands\/Documents\/Patapsco_Avalonmap.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/dnr2.maryland.gov\/publiclands\/Documents\/Patapsco_Avalonmap.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>The Grist Mill Trail at Patapsco Valley State Park course for 2.5 miles through the heavily wooded park between Ilchester Road and Lost Lake.

This six-member group draws inspiration from all over the world, utilizing Pan-American rhythms like cumbia, bossa nova, rumba, bolero, tango, jazz, rock and klezmer music. Their unique sound and the experience of their colorful, passionate performance leaves fans and new listeners mesmerized.<\/p> <p>The group's influences range from Miles Davis to The Beatles, Zeppelin to Janis Joplin and Mercedes Sosa to Ramon Ayala. Their common love of music and openness to all genres led them to the concept of La Santa Cecilia in 2007.<\/p> <p>They take their name from the patron saint of music, and epitomize the new bi-cultural generation-fully immersed in the modern music and art of the country they have called home from their youngest days, while adventurously fusing together a new sound that also pays homage to the rich traditions of their Mexican heritage.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Festival-of-the-Arts-Entertainment-Meetup\/events\/230177700\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":2700000,"name":"Conversaci\u00f3n Con La Santa Cecilia - Free Talk at Whole Foods","id":"230177700","time":1460831400000,"updated":1460834914000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451938787000,"name":"Columbia Festival of the Arts Entertainment Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":19277674,"urlname":"Columbia-Festival-of-the-Arts-Entertainment-Meetup","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Festival Buddies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Laurel","address_1":"935 Fairlawn Ave","name":"Laurel Haunt","lon":-76.85488,"id":24361679,"lat":39.09724,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":18.3559551239,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455211516000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Laurel\u2019s House of Horror, a haunted attraction built inside an abandoned movie theater, presents Maryland\u2019s newest attraction\u2026 \u201cEscape the Movies\u201d escape room!!

Decrees have a mystical power to them. They invoke the power and spirit of your innate divinity, the power of God that resides within you. Decrees are spoken out loud and release the power of the Word through the throat chakra. Every time you speak a decree out loud, you are drawing upon spirit so that God can act in your life in an expedient way.<\/p> <p>The Violet Flame is a unique spiritual energy that can help you in all areas of your life. It can heal emotional and physical problems, improve relationships and finances, help you grow spiritually, or just make life easier. It is the most advanced spiritual tool given to mankind to cleanse our karma without having to face or problems directly. As my mentor and teacher Liz Draman used to say \"clear the trauma without the drama\". It will literally clear the negativity around a specific situation, illness, etc. when invoked. It transmutes our karmic records into pure light. It has the power to transmute, to change and raise energy that has slow vibration into energy of higher vibration.<\/p> <p>Benefits of the Violet Flame: Transform fear into courage, Transform anxiety into peace, Heal personal and planetary karma, Clears karma at a cellular level, Raises energy body to a higher vibration, Spiritual accelleration, Improves relationships, Quickens the mind, Accelerates personal growth, Purifies negative energy, Transforms families and communities, Rejuvinates the physical body, Transforms illness, and more......<\/p> <p><br\/>If there is a situation in your life that you would like to heal quickly, then this is to tool for you!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/0\/f\/600_447157135.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Off of York Road in Timonium next to Nautilus Diner","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pure-Energy\/events\/227112432\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Violet Flame meditation with crystal singing bowls","id":"rqwnhlyvgbvb","time":1460847600000,"updated":1460904084000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430870560000,"name":"Pure Energy","group_lon":-76.6500015259,"id":18578143,"urlname":"Pure-Energy","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Energizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21048","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Finksburg","address_1":"2912 Club House Road","name":"Cedarhurst Unitarian Universalists","lon":-76.894516,"id":3899262,"state":"MD","lat":39.50079,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.7049980164,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1318168829000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>7:00 to 9:00 on the\u00a0third Saturday of every month.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

ShidaNatural's are created by Rashida Applewhite. Products will be available to try and purchase. ShidaNatural's healthy hair care products were specially formulated to tend to the special needs of natural curly kinky coily hair, which are all naturally dry &amp; thirsty. Although ShidaNatural's products are known as natural hair or curly hair products, all hair types will thrive from using ShidaNatural's no matter what the hair type or hair texture. Our products can also be used on relaxed\/straight hair. All of our products have one common ingredient, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).

Directions to the school are provided below. This series is offered to anyone over 16 years of age interested in learning the basic skills of cycling, including doing minor road repairs and improving as a rider. We can help you find your best riding level and develop so you can ride on the BBC casual rides by the end of the series. Experienced riders can meet other BBC members and learn about group riding. The ride series will cover both road and recreational trail riding. And we do have something for faster riders. Triathletes wanting to work on their gearing and cycling techniques are welcome. At the orientation, we will demonstrate cycling skills and techniques, discuss bicycles, equipment and clothing, and answer any questions about the program. We will watch a short, informative video on cycling safety and bike handling. If you bring your bicycle to the orientation, we can check it out for you and show you how to do a pre-ride bike check. The indoor orientation will be held RAIN OR SHINE. Weather permitting, anyone who wants to do so can join us for a short ride following the orientation. You must have and wear a helmet to ride.<\/p> <p>DIRECTIONS\u2013 Take Exit 25 \u2013 Charles Street- from the Baltimore Beltway (I\u2011695) and go South on Charles Street for approximately 2.1 miles (get in left turn lane). Make a left on Towsontown Blvd and at the second traffic light make a right onto Osler Drive. Immediately get into the left lane, go about 600 feet and make a left at the first traffic light. Enter the parking garage and park - the University Union is just past the far end of the parking garage. If you use the back door, you will need to take the stairs or elevator up to the second floor. If you walk around the building to the front door, you will enter on the second floor.<\/p> <p>ORIENTATION\u2013 Sunday, April 17, 2016 \u2013 The University Union at Towson University at 10:30 a.m.<\/p> <p>RIDE SCHEDULE\u2013 (Note that all rides start at 10:00 a.m., not 10:30)<\/p> <p>Sunday, April 24 NCR Trail, Paper Mill Rd Entrance at 10:00 a.m.<\/p> <p>Sunday, May 1 B&amp;A Trail\/BWI Loop from Marley Station Mall at 10:00 a.m.<\/p> <p>Sunday, May 8 Greenspring Station at 10:00 a.m. - Mother's Day Ride<\/p> <p>Sunday, May 15 Greenspring Station at 10:00 a.m.<\/p> <p>Sunday, May 22 Jacksonville at 10:00 a.m.<\/p> <p>Sunday, May 29 No Ride \u2013 Memorial Day Weekend<\/p> <p>Sunday, June 5 Jacksonville at 10:00 a.m<\/p> <p>Sunday, June 12 Graduation Ride to North Point State Park &amp; Ft.

Do you set such strong boundaries that prevent you from achieving intimacy in a relationship? Being in a relationship means being flexible enough to adapt and change your behavior when you are not meeting your partners needs but not to the point where you are ignoring your needs.<br\/>This 12 week program is designed to help individuals evolve to a new level of understanding and functioning so all of their relationships can have more commitment, sustenance, and a higher level of functional cohesiveness and balance.<br\/>The OPEN HOUSE is free to attend however the 12 week program requires a fee based on income. A $75 assessment and initial consult with the program coordinator, Carrie Hansen, MA, MSW, LCSW-C is mandatory prior to the first week's meeting on April 25, 2016.<br\/>This is necessary to determine your placement in the small group that participants are assigned to.<br\/>Find more information about the program and the fee structure at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.changingfocus.org\/programs\/moving-on-to-healthy-relating-mohr\/mohr-crofton\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.changingfocus.org\/programs\/moving-on-to-healthy-relating-mohr\/mohr-crofton\/<\/a> or[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainCrofton\/events\/230190096\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Boundaries OPEN HOUSE seminar for MOHR(Moving On to Healthy Relating)","id":"230190096","time":1461018600000,"updated":1461100398000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282432684000,"name":"Changing Focus - Single Again in Crofton","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1694643,"urlname":"SingleAgainCrofton","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"6800 Cradlerock Way","name":"Owen Brown Community Center","lon":-76.841057,"id":20218792,"lat":39.19445,"repinned":false},"headcount":27,"distance":13.5740671158,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448031581000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The mission of a Toastmaster Club is to provide a mutually supportive and positive learning environment in which every member has the opportunity to develop communication and leadership skills, which in turn foster self-confidence and personal growth.<\/p> <p>Our meetings are divided into three parts:<\/p> <p>In the first part of the meeting, prepared speeches are delivered by Columbia Toastmasters members.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/229723767\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvgbzb","time":1461101400000,"updated":1461114103000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"9200 Old Harford Rd","name":"Pine Grove Middle School","lon":-76.528885,"id":21759972,"lat":39.390026,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.47135162354,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455023491000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Singles play for all skill levels at Parkville HS<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-County-Tennis-Meetup\/events\/228723916\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesday Tennis ","id":"228723916","time":1461103200000,"updated":1461112518000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454508840000,"name":"Baltimore County Tennis Meetup","group_lon":-76.5400009155,"id":19500191,"urlname":"Baltimore-County-Tennis-Meetup","group_lat":39.3899993896,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21212","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"5851 York Road, 21212","lon":-76.60994,"phone":"410-889-6005","name":"Amazing Spiral","id":18099092,"state":"MD","lat":39.362984,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.08164262772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413986047000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tuesday Night Magic Event!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>(We also do, Friday Night Magic Tournaments, every other Wednesday and Pre- and Release Parties on Saturdays)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please join us for Tuesday'[\\ Night Magic<\/b><\/p> <p><b>6pm sign up<\/b><\/p> <p><b>6:30 start time<\/b><\/p> <p><b>cost: $15 \u00a0(Pay by cash or credit card when you come to Amazing Spiral)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$5 if you bring 3 booster packs<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gaming-Community\/members\/136069892\/\">David Wright<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Format for these events is Draft.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Paladar Latin Kitchen at Annapolis Town Centre is highly-rated on Yelp for being a vibrant restaurant with tasty food and an open bar area. Our SHR group has previously enjoyed happy hour there. Ample free parking is available at the Town Centre garages. A large Whole Foods and several other chain stores are nearby if you also want to do some shopping.<\/p> <p>Full details, directions, and reviews of Paladar Latin Kitchen below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paladarlatinkitchen.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paladarlatinkitchen.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.paladarlatinkitchen.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paladar-latin-kitchen-and-rum-bar-annapolis#query:jalepeno%20grill\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paladar-latin-kitchen-and-rum-bar-annapolis#query:jalepeno%20grill\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paladar-latin-kitchen-and-rum-bar-annapolis#query:jalepeno%20grill<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:30 pm to hopefully find a good spot at the bar.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

These interests include, among others, Dominance &amp; submission, bondage &amp; discipline, leathersex, fetishism, cross dressing, and roleplay. BESS is multi-sexual. All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more. These meetings are open to all who wish to attend; there is a small fee for each meeting.<\/p> <p>For more information see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bess-md.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bess-md.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BESS-MD\/events\/227884450\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Educational Meeting!

If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era\u2019s great transatlantic \u201cGreyhounds\u201d\u2014the fastest liner then in service\u2014and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.<\/p> <p>Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger\u2019s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small\u2014hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more\u2014all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.<\/p> <p>It is a story that many of us think we know but don\u2019t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.<\/p> <p>Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania<\/b>\u00a0is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library.

These paintings count among the world\u2019s favourites. Renoir, however, grew tired of this style and changed course. This stunning film \u2013 based on the remarkable collection of 181 Renoirs at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia \u2013 examines the direction he then took and why it provokes such extreme reactions right up to today. Some claim they are repulsed by Renoir\u2019s later works and some claim they are seduced. What may surprise many is that among the many artists who sought Renoir\u2019s new works out and were clearly highly influenced by them were the two giants of the 20th century \u2013 Picasso and Matisse.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The film is a fresh new biography of this artistic giant but more than that it uncovers a rarely told story that places Renoir as a critical link between the old and the new.\u00a0Watch the trailer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UeirVwJ6PSM\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/d\/e\/600_447269662.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/229182088\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Art Film: Renoir - Reviled and Revered","id":"229182088","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461322899000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21075","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Elkridge","address_1":"6425 Abel St","lon":-76.72754,"phone":"410-796-1190","name":"Elkridge MD 21075","id":172472,"state":"MD","lat":39.202324,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":8.37200927734,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1321829327000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our next meeting will start at 7pm<br\/>Meeting address:<br\/>6425 Abel St<br\/>Elkridge MD 21075<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>Our meetings are always free.<\/p> <p>Our meetings are informal and we tend to discuss whatever anyone has brought with them to show as well as discussing local rockhounding ideas.<\/p> <p>Even though we usually plan to wrap-up around 9pm, most of us are usually still chatting at 10.

The trio creates a sound that seamlessly merges flamenco with elements of jazz, world-music and even rock and soul influences.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Trio project and our new album is definitely the next big step. This sound has been percolating in me, in many ways since I was a teenager, and now all of the necessary pieces have finally come together in a way that is even better than I imagined,\u201d says Pascual. The new release, recorded and mixed by multi-Grammy-winning engineer Rob Griffin, is receiving critical acclaim across the US.<\/p> <p>Energized by a passion to share the beauty and soul-stirring power of Flamenco - with its ancient roots, yet vibrant and evolving musical tradition - Pascual\u2019s performances, recordings and workshops reverberate with infectious charisma. Jonathan \"Juanito\" Pascual is acclaimed as one of the top flamenco guitarists on the international music scene. NPR has called him \u201cone of the hottest flamenco guitarists in recent years\u201d and Boston Globe describes him as a \u201cflamenco phenom\u201d.<\/p> <p>Pascual has consistently sought ways to align his passion for music with environmental and social causes through creative partnerships. Most notable is his ongoing collaboration with Junglewood, a Panamanian rainforest project directed by Danilo Perez.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

Spring gave us a sneak preview of its impending return yesterday. With the arrival of Springtime this young man's thoughts turn to helping the Friends of Saint Vincent's Cemetery (FoSVC) with their semi-annual clean-up event. The good news is that a lot of the \"bull work\" has been done. Most of the overgrowth of weeds and trees has been cut back, and this year's effort will focus on the removal of debris and the planting of grass seed. Also, you can work as hard or as leisurely as you choose to and\/or are able, even if you participate as a greeter who gets people signed in, or hands out literature. HEAVY LIFTING NOT REQUIRED! This will be the GFB's third collaboration with the FoSVC; and, I find these events to be the most personally rewarding. This is our chance to give back - respect, dignity, honor - to those who have gone on before us, and whose lives and stories are the true \"plot\" of all of our interesting and enjoyable Grave Friends experiences.<\/p> <p>Last Spring, our membership numbers were not what they are now. We are currently 427 members and growing. Last Fall, the weather was awful. The Good Book says that we should return 10% of what we have to the Source of our spiritual foundation (however you personally choose to celebrate that). So, in that regard, my target for this event is to get 50 participants signed up - about 10% of us - to give back GFB style!<\/p> <p>Please come out in numbers to support this wonderful and worthwhile cause.

Please give your attention, go with me, let us inquire together. We say there is good and evil. There is envy and love, and we say that envy is evil and love is good. Why do we divide life, calling this good and that bad, thereby creating the conflict of the opposites? Not that there is not envy, hate, brutality in the human mind and heart, an absence of compassion, love, but why do we divide life into the thing called good and the thing called evil? Is there not actually only one thing, which is a mind that is inattentive? Surely, when there is complete attention, that is, when the mind is totally aware, alert, watchful, there is no such thing as evil or good; there is only an awakened state. Goodness then is not a quality, not a virtue, it is a state of love. When there is love, there is neither good nor bad, there is only love. When you really love somebody, you are not thinking of good or bad, your whole being is filled with that love. It is only when there is the cessation of complete attention, of love, that there comes the conflict between what I am and what I should be. Then that which I am is evil, and that which I should be is the so-called good. You watch your own mind and you will see that the moment the mind ceases to think in terms of becoming something, there is a cessation of action which is not stagnation; it is a state of total attention, which is goodness. - \u00a0J. Krishnamurti, <i>The Book of Life<\/i><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/%7Er\/JKOnline_DailyQuotes\/%7E3\/nx0adOVkFRo\/20160220.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email\">A Problem that Thought Cannot Resolve<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>The self is a problem that thought cannot resolve. There must be an awareness which is not of thought. To be aware, without condemnation or justification, of the activities of the self - just to be aware - is sufficient. If you are aware in order to find out how to resolve the problem, in order to transform it, in order to produce a result, then it is still within the field of the self, of the 'me'. So long as we are seeking a result, whether through analysis, through awareness, through constant examination of every thought, we are still within the field of thought, which is within the field of the 'me', of the 'I', of the ego, or what you will. As long as the activity of the mind exists, surely there can be no love. When there is love, we shall have no social problems. \u2013J.Krishnamurti, <i>What Are You Doing with Your Life?<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cDialogue is an attempt to explore together questions of existence as they relate to our daily lives.\u00a0 The focus of the dialogue group is not solely on the questions, but also on the moment in which each question arises, and on the whole thought\/emotion\/relational process with which the individual and the group engage the question.\u00a0 In contrast to debate and discussion, dialogue is not a comparison of opinions or an attempt to convince another of a held conviction.\u00a0 Dialogue is an inquiry.\u201d \u2013 Silver Spring Inquiry into Self Dialogue Group<br\/><\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Right-Action-and-the-Self-A-Dialogue-Inquiry-Group\/events\/230266298\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Conflict of the Opposites: A Problem Thought Cannot Resolve","id":"230266298","time":1461434400000,"updated":1461447031000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340570701000,"name":"Right Action and the Self: A Krishnamurti-Inspired Dialogue","group_lon":-76.6399993896,"id":4157492,"urlname":"Right-Action-and-the-Self-A-Dialogue-Inquiry-Group","group_lat":39.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lutherville Timonium","address_1":"2 Oakway Rd. 21093","name":"The Insight Center","lon":-76.625351,"id":23530192,"state":"MD","lat":39.439014,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":10.3208684921,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455057207000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/%7Er\/JKOnline_DailyQuotes\/%7E3\/cUaAPXamjYk\/20160207.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email\">Conflict of the Opposites<\/a><\/p> <p>I wonder if there is such a thing as evil? Please give your attention, go with me, let us inquire together. We say there is good and evil. There is envy and love, and we say that envy is evil and love is good. Why do we divide life, calling this good and that bad, thereby creating the conflict of the opposites? Not that there is not envy, hate, brutality in the human mind and heart, an absence of compassion, love, but why do we divide life into the thing called good and the thing called evil? Is there not actually only one thing, which is a mind that is inattentive? Surely, when there is complete attention, that is, when the mind is totally aware, alert, watchful, there is no such thing as evil or good; there is only an awakened state. Goodness then is not a quality, not a virtue, it is a state of love. When there is love, there is neither good nor bad, there is only love. When you really love somebody, you are not thinking of good or bad, your whole being is filled with that love. It is only when there is the cessation of complete attention, of love, that there comes the conflict between what I am and what I should be. Then that which I am is evil, and that which I should be is the so-called good. You watch your own mind and you will see that the moment the mind ceases to think in terms of becoming something, there is a cessation of action which is not stagnation; it is a state of total attention, which is goodness. - \u00a0J.

Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit.<\/p> <p>I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming, to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls. (maybe even some voice) You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. All you need do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted. See my webpage for a list of benefits of sound healing.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>This is a donation based event.

MAMBO\u2019S SALSA SOCIAL W\/THE BACHATA INVASION<\/b><\/p> <p>Mr. Mambo\u2019s Salsa Social Started Sat, Jan 29, 2005, the brain child of Tommy Smith aka Mr. Mambo conceived of as a Practice Party for his regular Salsa Students at the DC Dance Collective. Mr. Mambo was the DJ and the Performers on that Cold, Snowy Inaugural Night were Orlando Machuco Jr and his partner, Elizabeth Deza. Even though it snowed hard that night with upwards of 5 inches accumulated on the ground, Mr. Mambo\u2019s had a crowd of almost 50 people and we were Ecstatic. The Social was structured initially for once a month. For the first 3 years, the DJ rotation would include Tommy Smith, Tanya J. Smith (who got a bad review from DC Salsa Meetup as playing too much Mambo, Go Figure), DJ Jon Trevino now known as DJ Vino, DJ Silenzio, &amp; DJ Edgar now known as the Elite Rumbero. The Snack Bar included Hot Home-Cooked Food by the Twins, Pauline and Paulette. Although Mr. Mambo\u2019s started out with the mission of being a Salsa Practice Party for Tommy Smith\u2019s Students, none of his students came. Instead, a small, steady, loyal group of People from the DC Salsa Community were regulars.<\/p> <p>\u00a0In Nov 2007, Earl Rush aka Go Go Earl of Stuck on Salsa Fame approached Tommy Smith about doing a Partnership with Mr. Mambo\u2019s to enhance Mr. Mambo\u2019s Salsa Social\u2019s profile in the Salsa Community at Large. The First Venture from that collaboration was the Birthday Party of Tanya J. Smith and it was a smashing success. Now, many of the Hard-Core Dancers from the DC Salsa Community became Regulars. Other changes that occurred from the Earl and Tommy Collabo were increasing the Social to twice a month on a Set schedule- Every 2nd and 4th Sat of the month- and the use of 2 Rotating DJs Upstairs. The Rotating DJs took it upon themselves to play music beyond the regular commercial fare found at the average Salsa Venue and exposed the Dancers to New (actually Old) music that wasn\u2019t played often. At that time, the Regular Rotating DJ Roster included DJ Neo, DJ Vino, DJ EricB, DJ Bruno, DJ Renzo, DJ Steve Martin, &amp; DJ Dola. This Delighted the Dancers exponentially and the Music Bar was raised substantially in the DC\/MD VA area! As a result of these changes, The Partnership of Earl and Tommy doubled the regular attendance of Mr. Mambo\u2019s to almost 100 people and increased the reputation of Mr. Mambo\u2019s outside of the DC Metro Area. Tommy Smith enlisted the regular services of a once unknown New Dancer in town, James Yoon aka General Yoon in May 2008 and this further upped the Ante of the Mr. Mambo\u2019s Salsa Social as a High Quality Social where you could get Good, Challenging Training, Great Music, and Good Dances on the Regular. Mr. Mambo's was becoming a Salsa Force to be reckoned with in the DC Salsa Scene.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tommy Smith and Earl Rush ended their partnership amicably and Tanya J. Smith took over the role of Promoter and Creative Events Director for the Mr. Mambo\u2019s Social April 2010. Tanya received daily insight and tutelage from Earl Rush during his tenure at Mr. Mambo\u2019s so she was able to seamlessly pick up the ball and run with it by first, highlighting the Dancing and the Music at Mr. Mambo\u2019s with 24\/7 Video Coverage at the Socials. She began to Promote constantly on Social Media, following the lead of her former mentor Earl Rush. With the help of Jon Trevino and the counsel of Tommy Smith, Tanya started to put together Special Events and Workshops at Mr. Mambo\u2019s to highlight exciting new &amp; rising Performers\/DJs\/Dance Styles which included Magna Gopal, Bio Ritmo Band, Norbetto Betto Herrera, Julissa Cruz, Psyon Giannii Scott, DJ Antonio La Conga, Joel Dominguez &amp; Maria Palmeiri, Giovanni Roggiero, DJ Efrain Flores, Carlos Cardo, DJ Asho, Marc Brewer &amp; Sarah Zuccaro, Antonio Doza Williams &amp; Elleanee Jimmenz, Markus Smith &amp; Trendlyon Veal, DJ Tico, DJ Hercules, Eric Jones-Santana and many more. Also during this time period, The 2nd Floor was opened up for dancing initially to incorporate the Bachata\/Timba\/Salsa Romantica Crowd in 2011 with the Help of DJ Oscar BA. Then in Feb 2012, Mr. Mambo\u2019s decided to make the 2nd Ballroom primarily a Bachata Haven since Bachata had woven its way firmly into the Salsa Landscape. Yulio Jeisson Guitterez aka El Chalan de La Bachata was the First Host of the Now Popular Mr. Mambo\u2019s Bachata Invasion to overwhelming success.\u00a0<\/p> <p>April 23, 2013, Mr. Mambo's Celebrated our 8YR Anniversary at the Hollywood Ballroom to an astonishing success- almost 500 people attended from up and down the East Coast! Coincidentally, the DC Dance Collective, our home for 8yrs was soon to be sold and under new management that wasn't as favorable to our social as it had been in years past. We made the move to Hollywood Ballroom in June 2013 and haven't looked back!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Today, Mr. Mambo\u2019s Salsa Bachata Social is operates in MD and VA held Every 1st, 2nd, and 4th Saturday of the month at The Hollywood Ballroom and The Crown Dance Studio. Mr. Mambo's regularly gets 200+ Dancers of all Levels and draws from 5 Latin Dance Disciplines- Salsa ON1 &amp; ON2\/Bachata\/Kizomba\/Timba\/Zouk from the DC\/MD\/VA Area and from across the country. We are looking forward to Doing Bigger and Better Events for the Salsa Latin Community. With this Event, we extend a WARM THANK YOU TO EVERYONE who has helped us and\/or supported us along the way!\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.salsalovesmambo.com and www.tanyajsmith.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mr-Mambo-Salsa-Bachata\/events\/229777484\/","yes_rsvp_count":110,"duration":25200000,"name":"MR.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north.

They included Emerson, Immanuel Kant, and the historical Jesus. The deepest and most consistent source, however, was Judaism. Raised in a culture committed to Reform Judaism, Adler carried into Ethical Culture an appreciation of some lofty goals of family tradition, such as a collective duty to heal a broken world and liberate humanity from oppression. In this season of Passover, which honors the ancient liberation from Egyptian slavery, Hugh Taft-Morales explores some of the Jewish and Reform roots of Ethical Culture.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:<\/b> Hugh Taft-Morales joined the Baltimore Ethical Society as its professional leader in 2010, the same year he was certified by the American Ethical Union as an Ethical Culture Leader.

You change by imperceptible amounts with every connection and conversation. Even if you cling to the past, you are ever changing. Change is difficult and often includes re-examining core ideas which underpin our values and identity. There are times when we can be overwhelmed by change and the insecurity that comes with the unknown or unknowable. These insecurities have kept many of us in static relationships with others that do not serve our needs. Embarking on new journeys is profoundly life changing and during times of transition there are proactive steps we can take to lighten our emotional burdens. The obvious things come in the form of self-care; get enough sleep, eat well, exercise, make sure you spend time around others, get \"outside your head\" by working or hobbies and most importantly express your feelings to a friend or therapist. Doing these simple things can help you bring awareness to yourself during the change and will aid you in making good decisions which are inline with your true nature. Please join us at this Meetup where Bob Gordon will be presenting further on how to cope with the trepidations of change.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainEllicottCity\/events\/230582727\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Times of Transition","id":"230582727","time":1461625200000,"updated":1461637900000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347632348000,"name":"Single Again - Columbia\/Ellicott City","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4927242,"urlname":"SingleAgainEllicottCity","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"1402 South Main Chapel Way","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-76.679863,"id":11848762,"state":"MD","lat":39.037663,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":17.7634887695,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461242432000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's get together and play games with a standard deck of cards.

Where are the intersects dividing PR, marketing and social media? How can PR contribute to a content marketing strategy? David Harrison, president Harrison Communications, has been conducting PR campaigns for associations for more than 15 years, placing client associations in the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, CNN, among other media. David will explain why associations are perfect for increased visibility through PR and how exposure through the media help your association. He will also lead us in a discussion to address how to combat the risks and fears of media relations. Plan to join us for Part 2 on May 24 to explore Marketing: the art of successful multi-channel, integrated marketing campaigns for associations.<\/p> <p>In Part Two, Denise Gavilan, owner and marketing strategist, Gavilan &amp; Associates, will lead a discussion on how to conceptualize and execute successful multi-channel, integrated marketing campaigns for associations. Denise is a former in-house marketing professional with ASAE and her company focuses exclusively on national marketing campaigns for associations.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

For those not familiar, a sensory bin is just a bin or tub of material(s) that allow the young child to use various senses and creativity to explore textures, colors, etc using their hands or various \"tools\" (for older tots) to strengthen fine motor skills. <a href=\"http:\/\/littlebinsforlittlehands.com\/all-about-sensory-bins-5-things-need-know\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/littlebinsforlittlehands.com\/all-about-sensory-bins-5-things-need-know\/<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>I will prepare 6 sensory bins to share, and ask every mom to bring at least one for EACH child who will participate so kids can move at their own pace and have a choice of options when they want a different choice without limiting a child still exploring a given bin. Please note bins can be VERY basic and require no more than 1-2 minutes to prepare. A plastic (or other various container the size of a shoe box or larger), filled 1\/2-3\/4 with given medium (I will make a \"dyed spegetti\", \"water beads\", \"dyed dry rice\", \"flour\", \"dried large beans\", and \"sand\" bins), add 3-5 (write on bin the # of items\/theme) hidden treasures from around your house (plastic dinosaurs, plastic food items, plastic water animals, large bottle caps, little people, literally anything)...and done! It is nice for the bin to have a theme (i.e. Dinosaurs, or water animals, or dogs)...<\/p> <p>My older tot (almost 3), loves playing with various kitchen tools and small cups when exploring a sensory bin, so bring such \"tools\" for your tot to enhance experience and interest as appropriate for their age. I absolutely love <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/aw\/s\/ref=is_s_ss_i_1_23?k=learning+resources+fine+motor+tool+set&amp;sprefix=learning+resources+fine\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/aw\/s\/ref=is_s_ss_i_1_23?k=learning+resources+fine+motor+tool+set&amp;sprefix=learning+resources+fine<\/a><\/p> <p>Although a spoon and a small cup are great too! (Youngest friends just need hands, determine your own child developmental abilities)<\/p> <p>Do not feel as though you must create a different sensory medium bin from one I listed because all are great (and treasures will all be different), just use what you have on hand, and if possible list what medium you will choose in the comment section when you RSVP so we have some variety. Blandair park (near Oakland mills) has a huge covered area with picnic tables right next to playground, in front of the main parking lot (you can't miss it) There is a bathroom too.

time:<\/b> Meet between 5:45 and 6:00 at parking lot. Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Please survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made of the first Hump Day ride this year. We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BTrJhMh26ZU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BTrJhMh26ZU<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days starting shorter, the rides will be a little shorter, but I'm still trying to maintain about 12 to 15 miles. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. \u00a0Distance will grow with more daylight.<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back around 8:30, so around 2 1\/2 hours. \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you will probably need it with the days starting off shorter. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

It is an evidence based transformative practice of deep relaxation and meditation that releases negative emotions and thought patterns and calms the nervous system. It helps you to develop a sense of well-being and equanimity and teaches you how to deal with the challenging circumstances you encounter in your life in a calm and relaxed manner.<\/p> <p>Yoga Nidra is one of the most effective techniques for unleashing the power of your deep unconscious. The literal translation of Nidra is sleep. However, Yoga Nidra is a dynamic state, not the unconscious sleep of nighttime. In ordinary sleep we have an opportunity to the rest the body and mind, however, Yoga Nidra has the ability to alter your unconscious programming. This practice can be learned quickly and repeated often to gain the maximum benefits of changing your unskillful and unwanted habits. Yoga Nidra works by dropping your brainwaves into deep states of consciousness through relaxation and breathing techniques and guided meditation. Here, you simultaneously access the power of the logical left brain and the intuitive, insightful right brain, and align your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to restore the body and mind to balance.<br\/>Learn a proven method to change how you deal with stress and use the power of your own inner source to create the changes and to develop the peace you are looking for in your life. This technique is done lying on your back or sitting up in a chair. No yoga experience needed.

The book is also a history of a field many readers might never have heard of: scientometrics, \u201cthe science of science,\u201d a way of quantifying the growth of ideas. The author shows, too, how the principles of scientometrics can be applied to other fields, examination of various surviving copies of Chaucer\u2019s The Canterbury Tales, for instance, allowing researchers to track back to Chaucer\u2019s own original version.
