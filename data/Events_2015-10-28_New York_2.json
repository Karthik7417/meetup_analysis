Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm.

If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation\u00a0of $10.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. \u00a0Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> by the name Krishna.<\/p> <p>Here is\u00a0the general schedule of our\u00a0meetups:\u00a0we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 Then, we\u00a0have a class on <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>, which lasts\u00a0for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the class, we will go through verses of the <i>Gita<\/i> in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. \u00a0By about 7:30, the last kirtan\u00a0begins;\u00a0it lasts for about 30 minutes. \u00a0A\u00a0sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p> <p>Admission to each meetup is free. \u00a0Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p> <p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/225659929\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"pckzrytnbfb","time":1443907800000,"updated":1443995719000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"199 14th Street (btw. 4th & 5th Avenues)","name":"The Gallery Players","lon":-73.949997,"id":9864552,"state":"NY","lat":40.650002,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":7.23489904404,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441844930000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>THIS FANTASTICALLY POPULAR SHOW IS SURE TO SELL OUT QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S THE LAST WEEKEND OF ITS RUN. \u00a0RESERVATIONS ARE STRONGLY SUGGESTED. \u00a0 PREMIUM SEATS WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR OUR GROUP.<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Tickets are $18 (+ facility fee if purchased online) and MUST be purchased in advance to guarantee your seat. \u00a0Visit \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/galleryplayers.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/galleryplayers.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/galleryplayers.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>You may also\u00a0call Ovationtix\u00a0at (212) 352-3101.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Or you can request tickets by emailing them at\u00a0[masked]. \u00a0Be sure to specify date\/time of performance requested.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Shows do sell out, so I recommend you purchase your ticket in advance and not wait to pay at the door on the day of the event.<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet for a bite\/drink beforehand at the Prospect Bar and Grill, located around the corner at 545 Fifth Avenue (bet. 14th and 15th Streets).

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Make sure you know how to access your Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, focal points on the camera, and manual focus on your lens. If you don't, please review your camera's manual. You should also have access to a timer on your camera, to give yourself a few extra seconds to run in front of your camera, and be ready to start painting.\u00a0 If you have a different type of camera (ie point and shoot) with manual settings, you should be able to use it as long as you are able to control the shutter speed.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Camera battery and memory card -- make sure your battery is fully charged and your memory card is formatted and\/or empty.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Tripod -- all long exposures require the camera to be as still as possible, unless you like blurry, unfocused images.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Your choice of speed light \/shoe flash, bright flashlight, LED Light, or colored glow sticks -- you can get the flash light or LED light at any hardware store. Glow sticks can be found at a party store.<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Remote -- this is OPTIONAL. Remotes are usually for long exposures exceeding 30 seconds. If you plan on trying something big and time consuming, a remote would be a good idea.<\/p> <p>*Dark clothing -- unless you want to be seen clearly in the photo, dark clothing will work best for light painting.<\/p> <p>Please dress for the weather, wear comfortable shoes. Be aware of your surroundings and don't block pedestrian walkways with your tripods.<\/p> <p>WARNING: There are no open bathrooms available in the park.<\/p> <p>Details of this event may be added or changed at any time, so please check in periodically on this page.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, text me before the day of the event.

To make this even more challenging there will be opportunities to win or steal additional ingredients.<\/p> <p>Each team will have to create an appetizer, dinner, side dish, dessert, and you need to come up with creative names for them all! Of course each dish must contain at least one fruit. All of these dishes need to be created in a set amount of time (80 minutes). There are no recipes, you decide what to make as a team. At the end we will all be the judge. Teams will be judged on appearance taste, and the best named dish.<\/p> <p>Special prizes will be awarded :-)\u00a0<\/p> <p>So let's get together and have some fun!<\/p> <p><b>We have limited kitchen space so there will only be two teams of three, but if the group is full and you would like to be a\u00a0non-cook guest to be a judge and\u00a0enjoy the meal please send me an email and I will add you to the event.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you wish to drink with us please contribute a bottle of wine or cocktail.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>I have a small 7lb hypo allergenic Yorkie Poo named Pepper, he is really sweet and loves people, but if you have an issue with dogs please refrain from RSVPing to this event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Fine Print:<\/p> <p>Cancellations: Please be 100% committed to attending this event, and cancel 48 hours in advance.

Having seen people in his life join the fight, Boyraz views his work as a sort of \u201cimage-based activism\u201d that he uses to explore the struggle of the Kurdish community in the Middle East, as well as his own roots. Focusing on individuals, <i>Back Drop<\/i> puts a face to a complex political struggle, exploring a culture that struggles for its rights. Faced with the realities of war and an uncertain future, what are the responsibilities of individuals to their communities, their heritage, and their beliefs?<\/p> <p>Kurdistan--an area that is not a country, but an area spread across Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria--is inhabited by the Kurds, a group considered to be the largest ethnic community without its own country. For decades, resistance groups have fought for a homeland for the Kurdish people in a continuously tumultuous region. With no national boundaries, identities are formed through self determination--and political rights in autonomous Kurdish communities are only obtained through the resistance of the people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In a triptych created in collaboration with Martin Nordstr\u00f6m, Boyraz tells the stories of two Kurdish individuals: one who is preparing to leave to join the guerilla struggle against Daesh (ISIS) and one who has returned from the fight. Each individual is situated in front of a backdrop, a prop once used by guerrilla theatre troupes. Set against varied landscapes, the borders of the backdrop provide an oddly precise framing for the portraits. The three stories in triptych format recall religious artwork and encourage the viewer to reflect upon not only the stories being told, but their role in the personal struggles of others. Boyraz not only captures war from the perspective of those fighting it, but explores internal struggles and his relationship with the subjects. He presents the future, present, and past of the Kurdish guerilla struggle, uniting the stories of individuals with one, common backdrop.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Savas Boyraz was born in Istanbul, Turkey. He obtained his BFA in photography from the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University and his MFA from the Art in the Public Realm program in Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design. Boyraz has received awards from the Hasselblad Foundation, the Swedish Arts Grants Committee, and the HSBC Photography Award. He has participated in exhibitions in the Duhok International Film Festival (Iraq), Amed Art Gallery (Turkey), Berlin Kurdish Film Festival (German), Teatro di Nascosto (Italy), Aperture Foundation (US), Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles (France), and Michaelis Galleries (South Africa) among others.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceGallery\/events\/225567213\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"OPENING RECEPTION: Savas Boyraz's \"Back Drop\"","id":"225567213","time":1443913200000,"updated":1443921976000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442518768000,"name":"Open Source Gallery","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18941888,"urlname":"OpenSourceGallery","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Astoria","address_1":"27-16 23rd Ave","name":"QED Astoria","lon":-73.91507,"id":23487596,"state":"NY","lat":40.775856,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.31769657135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443463354000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Sat the QED brings the best in stand up comedy to their stage with the show Nerd is The New Black.

On one hand is a vibrant, bustling dining room that would not feel out of place in Manhattan. The sounds of lively chatter pervade the open space, hanging over rows of wooden tables where napkins stand upright on plates like swans engaged in staring contests. This electric atmosphere juxtaposes neatly with the quieter corners of the restaurant, where eyes are drawn to elaborate woodcarvings and ears perk up at the sound of water burbling across bricks and sandstones imported from Thailand.<\/p> <p><br\/>This fusion between West and East\u2014between fast-paced and meditative\u2014carries over to the\u00a0Zagat\u00a0-rated restaurant's menu. Sweat-inducing spices strike a balance with the sweet flavors of papaya in colorful curries. Similarly, crushed peanuts and handpicked bean sprouts lend a pleasant crunch to the rice noodles of a traditional pad thai dish. Purple- and orange-tinged lamps dangle above guests as they sample the spread of Thai cuisine, giving them the appearance of tigers at a black-light rave.<\/p> <p>Here's a great review by a prior diner:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"My wife and I had a Groupon and decided to have dinner here one night. The inside is small with about 15 tables with a nice Thai ambience. When it came time to order the hostess was very informative which helped us in making our dinner decision. In addition the owner came out and explained the specials to us. One of the specials was salmon which he stated was sourced from Prince Edward Island. That made an impression on me and showed that it was important enough for him to mention where your potential meal was from.\u00a0<br\/>We started off with our drink orders with my wife ordering her favorite red wine and I choosing to try a Thai beer. My Thai beer was very refreshing and paired well with the spicy dish I ordered for my entr\u00e9e.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our appetizer was the Steamed pork dumpling. We were given five generous size dumplings that were in a soy type of sauce with a bok choy vegetable accompaniment. The dumplings were very flavorful with the right texture, not chewy and not mushy. We also had the house salads which came with a choice of two types of dressings. I chose the peanut dressing and my wife chose the sesame ginger dressing. Both salads were a mix of greens with cucumber and tomato added in and had the right amount of dressing drizzled on.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For my entree I chose the Prix Prou with shrimp which is noted to be spicy on the menu. I like my food spicy so I ordered it to be a three pepper rating out of a four. This dish consisted of mixed vegetables and cashews with shrimp added in. The sauce was a spicy chili type of sauce that also had jalapenos in it. The shrimp were kind of on the small side but were cooked perfectly with the vegetables. This spicy dish also went well with the Thai beer I ordered. My wife chose the Grilled tiger prawns which were butterflied large shrimps that were seasoned and grilled and put on wedges of sliced potatoes. It came with a lime ginger type of sauce which she thought was very tasty. Our server also bought out hot sauces to try with her dish in case she wanted to make it a little spicier.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We decided to order desert and ordered the fried banana. This turned out to be one of the best deserts I ever had bar none. The banana was coated in a coconut batter and deep fried. It was crispy and not greasy at all. It was accompanied with green tea ice cream and whipped cream. The ice cream had the right consistency not too hard or too soft. Let me warn you that once you have this desert you may become addicted because I have been thinking about it ever since. I also ordered tea and could not decide between the Jasmine or Thai tea. The owner explained what both teas were like and I eventually chose the Thai tea. He also brought me the Jasmine tea to try so I had two teas to finish my meal with.\u00a0This place turned out to be a gem and we will definitely go back again.\"<\/p> <p>wow what a statement!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other diners are more succinct: \"My husband always orders the Pad Thai chicken and loves it. I alternate between the Pad See Ewe and one of the currys. The service is lovely and the atmosphere comfortably intimate.\"<\/p> <p>Another wrote: \"Love this place. Great food is always fresh and super tasty. This red curry is tinglingly hot.....perfect. Service always excellent too. Try it, you will love it too.\"<\/p> <p>And one more, \"I like Thai foods and often choose Thai restaurant when eating out. I'm sure that Full Moon is the best Thai restaurant in Westchester. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. The chef seems to be talented enough to carefully design sophisticated flavors, going far beyond the average level of the neighborhood restaurants.\"<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please find us in the bar...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/diningout-219\/events\/225616673\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Let's go for Thai Food at Full Moon Thai in White Plains!","id":"225616673","time":1443913200000,"updated":1443986322000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1129506815000,"name":"Cheap Eats and other foodie delights of Westchester","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":211795,"urlname":"diningout-219","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Cheap Eats and Foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Flushing","address_1":"132-01 Roosevelt Ave 2FL","name":"New York RUDANCENY Ballroom Dance School","lon":-73.834999,"id":23744332,"state":"NY","lat":40.758183,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.1487531662,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430006338000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We welcome all dance lover join this Satuday Soical dance party.

They will spin original 45s from their own collections.<\/p> <p><br\/>We've been trying for YEARS to arrange to bring these incredible soul DJs over for a UK night and we are so excited we can finally make it happen! So don't miss out. You may wait years for another opportunity to dance to the brilliant 45s played by these fine DJs\u2014or fly to London to do so!<\/p> <p><br\/>Of course it wouldn't be Subway Soul Club if we didn't have resident DJ Phast Phreddie the Boogaloo Omnibus also playing records, a gorgeous wooden dance floor and a big screen projecting images from the Sixties. Plus, Brit hostess with the mostest Lady Dawn will be meeting and greeting in all her Mod finery. You should wear yours, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>This Subway Soul Club event, presented in association with our friends at Cavestomp, will take place at Lucille\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill, located in the legendary B.B.

src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/6\/4\/600_442566500.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This film finds director Wes Craven in a transitional phase between his hard-hitting early work and his later commercial successes. As such, Deadly Blessing is an \"all over the map\" experience for viewers. The script veers back and forth between shock setpieces and an earnest exploration of religious repression, never truly committing to its genre until the last thirty minutes. At that point, it goes haywire with more than a few bizarre plot twists and a shock coda that feels tacked on. That said, Deadly Blessing is quite watchable for Craven fans despite these problems. The schizoid nature of the story ensures that it never becomes dull and the film distinguishes itself from the pack by offering a storyline that focuses on female characters and allows them to drive the plot. In terms of acting, Maren Jensen's lead performance is a bit flat at times but she gets nice support from Susan Buckner as a resourceful friend and Jeff East as a young sect member who finds his burgeoning adulthood bringing him into conflict with his religion. There are also scene-stealing turns by Ernest Borgnine as a brimstone-minded religious leader and Lois Nettleson as an eccentric neighbor (trainspotters will also notice a young Sharon Stone in there as Jensen's other gal-pal). Best of all, Wes Craven directs his unusual narrative with confidence, giving it a distinctive \"American gothic\" atmosphere and handling a number of creepy setpiecies with great skill: highlights include a skin-crawling nightmare involving a spider and a tense sequence where a snake slips into Jensen's bathtub while she isn't looking. In short, Deadly Blessing might be a mixed bag but its got enough eccentricities and stylish flourishes to make it worthwhile for fans of vintage horror.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q5bagblnFSY\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q5bagblnFSY<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/225731561\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Wes Craven's Deadly Blessing 35mm film print Midnight movie","id":"225731561","time":1443929400000,"updated":1443942244000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":10,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441232716000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/2\/c\/600_358564652.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I know I have done this several times before so I am challenging those have come previously to complete two Black Courses &amp; at least one\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.catamounttrees.com\/general-ropes-course-rules.cfm\">Double Black Courses<\/a>, but you can do at your own pace if this is your first time.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This park is an exciting aerial forest adventure that provides a variety of courses that are fun for all ability levels.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The afternoon is concluded with a thrilling joust between four knights on horseback.

We strongly desire to care for other species and ecosystems, and are unsure how we can maximize flourishing for individuals of all species, as well as for ourselves. One key to the many living well is to remember that we exist in an interdependent web where all beings are connected to each other in inherent worth, dignity and beauty.\u00a0<\/p> <p>More information:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rysec.org\/event\/nurture-nature\/?instance_id=2663\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rysec.org\/event\/nurture-nature\/?instance_id=2663\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rysec.org\/event\/nurture-nature\/?instance_id=2663<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>Join us for a more in-depth workshop at 1:30-4:30!\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>About the Speaker:\u00a0<\/b>Birds have always called to LoraKim Joyner. Since an early age she always had birds in the home, out in the pigeon coop, or eating at the yard feeder. Her hope for avian flourishing led her to a B.S. in Avian Sciences and then later to a D.V.M. where she specialized in birds. A later Masters in Preventive Veterinary Medicine emphasized avian research. Hearing birds call to her heart, she worked in other countries as a consultant in avian medicine and conservation, with an emphasis on parrot conservation. Her hopes for the birds led her to the Philippines, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Guatemala where she lived for several years. Her work with birds has also included working as a Clinical Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at the Nondomestic Avian Clinic at the College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University. There she later served as the Community Advocate, where she taught ethics and grief management as well as assisted staff, faculty, and clients in dealing with grief and ethical issues. Leaving active veterinary practice behind, she entered the Unitarian Universalist ministry. She encourages Animal Blessings and Earth Celebrations in congregations and is the president of Unitarian Universalists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (UFETA). She is seeking certification in Nonviolent Communication and is a Sufi Initiate. Today she serves as the minister of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Gainesville, Florida. There she continues her healing work, for her experiences have taught her that the birds cannot flourish if the human heart cannot heal, and the human heart cannot heal without knowing the great depth of suffering and beauty in all life.<\/p> <p><i>Sunday programs are held at 11:00 AM at the Riverdale-Yonkers Society for Ethical Culture.

I was twenty years old with two sons, both by different fathers. I didn\u2019t speak much English, and my manners were better suited to peasant villages and Saigon street corners than a suburb of San Diego, which was to be my new home \u2014 a place stranger to a Vietnamese farm girl than the dark side of the moon.<\/p> <p>\"My background was not like that of my American neighbors. By age twelve I had lost two brothers and countless uncles, aunts, and cousins to the war. By age fifteen I had been in battle, captured, tortured, \u2026condemned to death and raped\u2026.<\/p> <p>\"By sixteen I was an unwed mother supporting my family on Danang\u2019 s black market. By the time I was nineteen my father had committed suicide rather than involve me again with the Viet Cong, and I was married to de quoc My, \u201dthe enemy\u201d\u2014a middle-aged American civilian construction engineer, Ed Munro\u2014 in the desperate hope that would save me and my children from the war.\"<\/p> <p>\u2014 Le Ly Hayslip,\u00a0<i>Child of War, Woman of Peace<\/i><\/p> <p>In 1986, Le Ly returned to her native homeland, Vietnam, and was stunned by the devastation, poverty and illness left by the Vietnam and American War. She went to work.<\/p> <p>She initiated a\u00a0bridge building project to bring American veterans back to Vietnam to work with international volunteers and\u00a0her countrymen to re-build the villages destroyed in the war, providing a long elusive path to reconciliation and peace of mind for countless soldiers and citizens from all sides of the conflict. Her efforts to educate people about post-war conditions in Vietnam and to create new peaceful ties between Americans and Vietnamese were instrumental in persuading the US to re-establish and normalize relations with Vietnam in 1995. In 2000 Le Ly joined a delegation accompanying then President Clinton on his historic trip to Vietnam, the first by an American president since the end of the war.<\/p> <p>To acknowledge those who helped her healing the war and peacemakers throughout the world, she created a Bridge of Peace Awards Gala Ceremony to honor people like Oliver Stone, Ron Kovic, John McCain, John Kerry and many others.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/2\/1\/600_441815873.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"above Think Coffee (look for the brown door to the right\/south of Think and ring the bottom buzzer)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Social-Change-Meetup\/events\/225245455\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":9000000,"name":"A Talk with Le Ly Hayslip, inspiration of Oliver Stone\u2019s film \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d","id":"225245455","time":1443974400000,"updated":1443990607000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1419031359000,"name":"Spirituality & Social Change Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18263547,"urlname":"Spirituality-Social-Change-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Spiritual Activists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.73755836487,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423243845000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A small, supportive group for artists of all types to come together and talk about and share their creative projects in a fun, non-judgmental environment.

Walk north along Margaret Corbin Drive for approximately ten minutes or transfer to the M4 bus and ride north one stop. If you are coming from the Museum's Main Building, you may also take the M4 bus directly from Madison Avenue\/83rd Street to the last stop. (Please allow more time for this option.)<\/p> <p>By Car<br\/>Take Henry Hudson Parkway northbound to the first exit after George Washington Bridge (Fort Tryon Park\u2014The Cloisters). This exit is only accessible from the northbound lane; if coming from the north, take Henry Hudson Parkway southbound to exit 14\u201315, make a U-turn, and travel north one mile to the exit marked Fort Tryon Park\u2014The Cloisters.<\/p> <p>Parking<\/p> <p>Visitors to The Cloisters may use free city parking available in Fort Tryon Park.<\/p> <p>Weather permitting, we will meet at 12PM AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE of the Cloisters Museum. There are a couple of benches right next to the bus stop. I'll wait there.<\/p> <p><br\/>*****<\/p> <p>I suggest splitting up into smaller groups before entering the festival. \u00a0Be warned that it\u00a0will be extremely crowded and most likely some of you will fall behind and get lost. \u00a0Don't worry, just enjoy the festival and take lots of photos. It ends at 6PM. There\u00a0are plenty of stands for food, handcrafts, arts, etc. There is also a couple of tournaments you may want to watch. Be early at the tournament field, again it will be crowded! Click on the link above for their website to review the program and the map.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Bring some snacks and water, or money to grab something to eat at one of the many food stands.<\/p> <p><br\/>* There are four locations with\u00a0toilets\u00a0in the park. Check the map.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Dress appropriate for the weather and wear comfy shoes.<\/p> <p>\u2022 As always, please be on time. Allow yourself enough travel time and check the MTA for any subway updates.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225653983\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflytnbgb","time":1443974400000,"updated":1443987353000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1000 5th Avenue","name":"The Metropolitan Museum of Art","lon":-73.961349,"id":23878857,"state":"NY","lat":40.596054,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":10.7641735077,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438315694000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>EVENT TYPE:<\/b> Class<\/p> <p><b>ADMISSION PRICE:<\/b> $1<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-zBLJ-o-Mmi4\/TqNZpD8RE2I\/AAAAAAAAAFk\/v9NAigNPYig\/s1600\/GR_153_1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DESCRIPTION:<\/b><\/p> <p>Try your hand at creating works of art in the galleries.

Perhaps best known for her self-portraits, Kahlo's work is remembered for its \"pain and passion\", and its intense, vibrant colors. Her work has been celebrated in Mexico as emblematic of national and indigenous tradition, and by feminists for its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.<\/p> <p>\u00a0At the age of 18, she was seriously injured in a bus accident.<\/p> <p>At 22 she married the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, 20 years her senior. Their stormy, passionate relationship survived infidelities, the pressures of careers, divorce, remarriage.<\/p> <p>During her lifetime, Frida created some 200 paintings, drawings and sketches related to her experiences in life, physical and emotional pain and her turbulent relationship with Diego. She produced 143 paintings, 55 of which are self-portraits.<\/p> <p>Both Frida and Diego were very active in the Communist Party in Mexico. In early July 1954, Frida made her last public appearance, when she participated in a Communist street demonstration. Soon after, on July 13th, 1954, at the age of 47, Frida passed away.<\/p> <p>Tikets: $25<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/tickets.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/tickets.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/tickets.php<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Directions:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/directions.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/directions.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/visit\/directions.php<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>2900 Southern Blvd., Bronx, NY 10458<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brodyaga\/events\/225814737\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life","id":"225814737","time":1443978000000,"updated":1444010870000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372387976000,"name":"Brodyaga \/ Russian adventure group","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":9125272,"urlname":"Brodyaga","group_lat":40.6399993896,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"137 Ludlow btw Stanton & Rivington","name":"Libation, 3rd Floor (last temp location)","lon":-74.005943,"id":24091763,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443558488000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>After getting their first win of the season The Texans head to Atlanta this weekend to take on The Falcons.

Cantor's counterintuitive discovery of a progression of larger and larger infinities created controversy in his time and may have hastened his mental breakdown, but it also helped lead to the development of set theory, analytic philosophy, and even computer technology.<\/p> <p>Smart, challenging, and thoroughly rewarding, Wallace's tour de force brings immediate and high-profile recognition to the bizarre and fascinating world of higher mathematics.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-math\/events\/223216032\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"name":"BOOK CLUB: \"Everything & More: A History of Infinity,\" by David Foster Wallace","id":"223216032","time":1443981600000,"updated":1443994393000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293578639000,"name":"Math for Math's Sake!","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1755448,"urlname":"nyc-math","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Pythagoreans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"2 West 64th Street","name":"New York Society for Ethical Culture","lon":-73.979698,"id":16393712,"state":"NY","lat":40.77116,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.5613951683,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400334436000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WHERE: New York Society for Ethical Culture, Celebration Hall\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>WHEN: 2 PM, every first Sunday<br\/>WHAT: An hour that combines engaging speakers and toe tapping songs.<br\/>WHAT ELSE: Socializing, coffee and cookies after the event<\/p> <p><br\/>GUEST SPEAKER: Melanie Brewster<\/p> <p>Melanie Brewster, Assistant Professor of Psychology and Education at Columbia University, earned her Ph.D from the University of Florida.

From Midtown or Greenwich Village, you could take the PATH train from the following PATH stations: 33rd Street\/6th Avenue, 23rd Street\/6th Avenue, 14th Street\/6th Street, 9th Street\/6th Avenue, or Christopher Street (between Hudson Street and Greenwich Street.) Once in New Jersey, the PATH subway train will stop in Hoboken, Newport (Jersey City), and then Grove Street (Jersey City). Depending on where you get in the PATH subway system, the train ride is about 14 to 22 minutes.<\/p> <p><b>More Transportation (from Manhattan):<\/b> You can take a NYC subway train (2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, or R) to the Fulton Center in lower Manhattan. Then walk a short distance and take the PATH subway train from the World Trade Center to Grove Street in Jersey City. Once in New Jersey, the PATH subway train will stop in Exchange Place (Jersey City) and then Grove Street (Jersey City).<\/p> <p><b>The PATH subway fare is $2.75 each way. You can use a New York City MetroCard to pay the fare (as long as it isn't a New York City unlimited MetroCard or a New York City Senior MetroCard.) Therefore, PATH takes only the New York City paid-per-ride MetroCard.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Transportation (from New Jersey)<\/b>: One option is to\u00a0take a New Jersey transit railroad train to the Newark Penn Station and then switch to a PATH subway train that is going to Grove Street.

Along the way they meet a recently reawakened carebot, BG-29, who serves as midwife at the birth of Sara\u2019s children, and begins to teach them about the world they find themselves in.

Send me an email with your email address so i can let you access the program.\u00a0 Each audio is approximately an hour long. I recommended listening up to 2x to each audio..don't listen to the same one over and over....maybe twice then on to the next....you can re-listen to the whole thing again after if you wish. I actually strongly encourage that.\u00a0 That has you internalize and become the information more and have you actually create and<b> manifest the circumstances you desire in your life faster and easier.<\/b><\/p> <p>I'm considering then setting up<b> in person meetings in NYC<\/b><\/p> <p>or possibly conference calls where we discuss the material and help each other understand it even more.

Somehow the billions of neurons in your brain work together to produce it, and all of the thoughts and feelings which it incorporates.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>In the Buddhist traditions from which many contemporary mindfulness practices derive, mindfulness techniques evolved as tools for deconstructing our usual view of ourselves and the world, for waking up from conventional, socially reinforced fictions about who we are and how to find happiness. This awakening occurs to the degree that we no longer believe in the self. It involves realizing what\u2019s called in Pali\u2014the language in which the Buddha\u2019s teachings were first recorded\u2014anatta, or non-self.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Resources for Discussion:<\/b><\/p> <p>Ajahn Brahmali gives a practical approach to understanding of non-self, and how to use this understanding in the practice.<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVQpdbAWSS8\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVQpdbAWSS8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVQpdbAWSS8<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Does Your Self Exist?

If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Join us to build a compost windrow at Earth Matter NY's unique midscale Compost Learning Center, a NYC Compost Project site on beautiful Governors Island. Volunteers help empty bins of food scraps, remove contaminants (plastics and other non-compostable items), and chop open whole foods to let in microbes. (We provide grabbers and gloves to protect your hands.) No experience necessary, but closed-toe shoes are a must.<\/p> <p>SIGNUP ON EARTH MATTER'S WEBSITE IS REQUIRED --<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/earthmatter.org\/registration\/?ee=710\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/earthmatter.org\/registration\/?ee=710<\/a><br\/>...and please also click \"Join\" on this page to let others know you're attending. You will receive details, ferry instructions, and any other information you need upon registering.<\/p> <p>Take direct action to join the NYC composting community that works to reduce NYC's waste stream and recycle organics into a fine soil amendment. On this community build we will combine 15,000 lbs of neighborhood food scraps with an equal amount of wood chips and yard waste. If you've ever dropped your food scraps off at a green market, this is one of the places where it is delivered -- help finish the recycling process, meet up with like-minded folk, and say hello to our 100+ chickens and a whole lot o' worms!<\/p> <p>Regular Earth Matter volunteers might be interested in applying for Earth Matter's 140-hour in-depth Compost Apprentice course that teaches all aspects of hands-on composting -- devices, builds, mixtures, animal composting, construction and tools, compost application, data collection, and more.

The event will take about an hour. Our \u201ccivilization\u201d has moved far beyond the days when a person could live \u201coff the land\u201d by picking berries and leafy greens. Today the closest the average person gets to the land is growing a garden, going to a pick-your-own farm, or a roadside stand. But what most people don\u2019t realize is that we are still surrounded by hundreds of wild edible plants in vacant fields, meadows, woodlands, and anywhere Mother Nature can grow her merry way. Join the Fanwood Environmental Commission on an \u201cEdibles Walk\u201d to find those plants that are hiding in plain view. Educator, naturalist, nutritionist, and wild plant expert Debbie Naha will lead us around Borough Hall and the local area in search of nature\u2019s own garden. Ms. Naha is a registered dietitian\/nutritionist and is a featured walk leader at the annual Union County Bio-Blitz held each June. Ms. Naha will point out those plants that can be harvested for salads and snacks (and perhaps a few you shouldn\u2019t touch).<br\/>Please visit the Fanwood Environmental Commission website: www.fanwoodec.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/wild-edibles-of-nj\/events\/225737875\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Take a walk on the \u201cWild Food\u201d side","id":"225737875","time":1444082400000,"updated":1444362205000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1375247909000,"name":"Wild Edibles of NJ","group_lon":-74.2799987793,"id":9596752,"urlname":"wild-edibles-of-nj","group_lat":40.6100006104,"who":"plant lovers, foragers, foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 642-2260","address_1":"40 W 40th St","name":"Cellar Bar @ Bryant Park Hotel","lon":-73.98307,"id":503466,"state":"NY","lat":40.752724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.409218966961,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434590000000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Chers ami(e)s,<\/p> <p>Thank you for making our now\u00a0WEEKLY event\u00a0\"Jadore le French\" a great success : c\u2019\u00e9tait ma premi\u00e8re surprise partie :-)\u00a0Pictures posted below !\u00a0Let's meet again at Cellar Bar to speak French (or at least try a bit with Manhattans).<\/p> <p>Special Thanks&amp;Hugs\u24c7 to the new members : you guys rock !Congratulations to Gabor and Abderaman, winners of the last raffle.<\/p> <p>MegaHugs\u24c7 to Amelia, Hostess Etincelante,\u00a0inventor of a new game using French quotes.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/a\/7\/600_431588615.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>French is not such a difficult language.

How a little girl born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina went on to become the monolithic Nina Simone is itself a story worth every turned page, but for Gilles Leroy, to understand Simone\u2019s life is to start at the end. After a star-studded career filled with peaks and chasms, we enter her life nearly ten years after she has stopped singing. At once an examination of her extraordinary talent and an attempt at understanding the internal and external factors that worked to destroy her, Nina Simone: A Novel positions Leroy as a master of imagining the story behind a portrait. Her internal landscape comes to the forefront of the narrative in terms of how she feels, what she sees, how she reacts, but most importantly, how the world\u2019s obsession with Simone causes Eunice to forget and eventually lose herself.<\/p> <p>Gilles Leroy was born in Bagneux, France in 1958. After studying experimental science in high school, Leroy went on to study literature, eventually obtaining a master\u2019s degree. He then took to learning through travel and immersing himself in American and Japanese literature. The American novel became a major influence for Leroy and influenced his decision to begin writing. He took on a range of odd jobs in the day, writing at night, and eventually became a journalist. Leroy published his first novel Habibi in 1987, and eventually left journalism in 1991 in order to focus fully on writing fiction. Among his most notable works are L\u2019Amant russe (2002), Grandir (2004), and Champ secret (2005). He was awarded the Prix Goncourt, France\u2019s most prestigious literary prize, for his novel Alabama Song (2007), which tells a story from the view of Zelda Fitzgerald, American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s wife. The book takes on a mix of biographical and fictional elements, examining the struggles and tragic fate of Zelda\u2019s life.<\/p> <p>Claudia Roth Pierpont has been a contributor to The New Yorker since 1990 and became a staff writer in 2004. The subjects of her articles have ranged from the Ballets Russes to the Chrysler Building, from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche to that of Mae West. A collection of eleven of Pierpont\u2019s New Yorker essays, Passionate Minds: Women Rewriting the World, was published in 2000. Nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, the book juxtaposes the lives and works of women writers, including Hannah Arendt, Gertrude Stein, Ana\u00efs Nin, Margaret Mitchell, and Zora Neale Hurston.<br\/>Pierpont has been the recipient of a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a fellowship at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers of the New York Public Library. Roth Unbound (FSG), her authorized biography of Philip Roth, was published to great acclaim in 2013.<\/p> <p>About Albertine Bookstore:<br\/>Tucked inside the historic Payne Whitney mansion, Albertine is the only bookshop in New York devoted solely to books in French and English with more than 14,000 contemporary and classic titles from 30 French-speaking countries.<\/p> <p>A project of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, the Albertine bookshop brings to life the French government\u2019s commitment to French-American intellectual exchange.

What we take for granted and what we question? And how do theories in computer science tell us something about the real world? Those are some of the questions that may inspire computer scientist like me (and you!) to look into philosophy of science.\u00a0I\u2019ll present the work of one of the more extreme (and interesting!) philosophers of science, Paul Feyerabend. In \u201cAgainst Method\u201d, Feyerabend looks at the history of science and finds that there is no fixed scientific methodology and the only methodology that can encompass the rich history is \u2018anything goes\u2019. We see (not only computer) science as a perfect methodology for building correct knowledge, but is this really the case? To quote Feyerabend:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Science is much more 'sloppy' and 'irrational' than its methodological image.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>I\u2019ll be mostly talking about Paul Feyerabend\u2019s \u201cAgainst Method\u201d, but as a computer scientist myself, I\u2019ll insert a number of examples based on my experience with theoretical programming language research.

This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity.

Winegrowers experimented with nontraditional French varietals.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll be trying a very unusual local grape that has been saved from extinction\u2014the little-known Sumoll.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Costers del Segre (Catalonia):<\/i>\u00a0 This is Catalonia\u2019s most inland wine region\u2014a harsh, semi-arid region that is isolated from Mediterranean influences. Irrigation here is essential. The cooler regions produce grapes for Cava (Parellada, Macabeo, Xarel-lo), and the warmer areas are suitable for red grapes (Tempranillo, Garnacha). \u00a0And Costers del Segre was the first Catalan region to authorize the use of international varieties in DO wines, such as Cabernet and Pinot Noir.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying an unusual (and intense) Syrah that was fermented in an ancient manner\u2014in stone troughs called <i>lagars.<\/i> \u00a0I tried this wine at a wine bar in Girona\u2014maybe the best \u20ac6 glass of wine I\u2019ve ever had.<\/p> <p><i>Utiel-Requena (Valencia):<\/i>\u00a0 Proceeding about 250 km down the coast, the next wine region you encounter is Valencia.\u00a0 Utiel-Requena, a flat, dry plateau situated 70 km inland, is Valencia\u2019s largest subregion, long known for bulk wine production using the prolific, heat-tolerant Bobal grape.\u00a0 But as is happening in many wine regions around the world, ambitious new producers are focusing on quality winemaking, elevating the reputation of a little-known region and grape.\u00a0 Bobal is deeply colored and tannic, but the tannins are countered by bright acidity, making it a refreshing food wine.\u00a0 The Bobals I tried in Valencia were among the most interesting wine discoveries of my trip.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Bullas (Murcia):<\/i>\u00a0 Further down the coast, Bullas is another hot, dry plateau that straddles the line between Mediterranean climate and the hot summer\/cold winter pattern of a continental region.\u00a0 Monastrell is the signature grape here, a dark, thick-skinned variety that can have savory, smoky, meaty aromas and flavors.\u00a0 The wines have traditionally been drunk young, but more ambitious producers make ageworthy examples matured in oak.\u00a0 We will be trying an oak-aged Bullas Monastrell\/Syrah blend made by Norrell Robertson, a Master of Wine and the <i>escoc\u00e9s volante<\/i> (flying Scotsman) of the wine\u2019s name.\u00a0 A 2006 vintage, this sturdy wine still retains its youth.<\/p> <p><i>M\u00e1laga:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a heavily tourism-dependent region on the Mediterranean coast of Andaluc\u00eda where the signature wines are sweet Moscatel and fortified Pedro Xim\u00e9nez.\u00a0 Dry table wines are produced, but it can be a challenge to find them.\u00a0 This may be the only wine region I\u2019ve ever visited where the local wines are not actively promoted.\u00a0 In M\u00e1laga and Marbella, I\u2019d inquire about local wines, and I\u2019d almost invariably be steered toward a Rioja, Rueda, or Ribera del Duero.\u00a0 But they do make some good stuff\u2014in the town of Ronda, I had a Serrania de Ronda Cabernet Sauvignon that was almost as remarkable as the view from my lunch table.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying two dry wines from M\u00e1laga, a dry Muscat from famed sweet wine maker Jorge Ordo\u00f1ez and an oak-aged red blend that is mostly old-vines Garnacha and includes the rare, local Rom\u00e9 grape.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/8\/d\/600_442348301.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be meeting at Le Village in the East Village, a French bistro with an interesting, mostly vegetarian menu (although if you want p\u00e2t\u00e9, coq au vin, or steak frites, you can get those too).<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/levillagenyc.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/levillagenyc.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/levillagenyc.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2009 Vinyes dels Aspres Blanc dels Aspres\u00a0 (Empord\u00e0, Catalonia<\/b>)\u00a0 <b>$28\u00a0 <\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16.5\/20<\/i> \u2013 Grenache Blanc.

Vinified totally dry, it is a riveting, perfumed, flowery white exhibiting notes of melons, honeysuckle and tropical fruits in a light-bodied, zesty, naked style. There are 5,000 cases of this cuv\u00e9e, which for ten years has been a reference point for what can be accomplished with this grape in terms of making dry wines versus the sweeter wines for which this area is famous.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Pardas Collita Roja (Pened\u00e8s, Catalonia)\u00a0 $33\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Collita Roja is produced from Sumoll grapes from a single vineyard of 0.72 hectares in St. Llorenc d'Hortons on chalky soils, planted in 1949. The wine has a bright ruby color and a shiny nose of bright red fruits intermixed with strong balsamic aromas of wild herbs, intensely Mediterranean with lots of character, and a tasty, light to medium-bodied palate with piercing licorice and ripe fruit flavors that transport you to a Mediterranean forest. With time, more continental and Atlantic notes develop in the glass, which give the wine more depth and complexity. I loved it. Drink now-2020.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Castell d'Encus Thalarn\u00a0 (Costers del Segre, Catalonia)\u00a0 $44\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Antonio Galloni 92<\/i> \u2013 (All Syrah that was fermented in stone pits and aged in 70% new French oak for 10 months.) Inky purple. Black raspberry, cherry and rooty sassafras on the pungent nose. Fleshy and expansive, offering deep cherry and dark berry flavors, a hint of olive and a suave touch of candied violet. Picks up spiciness with air and finishes on a spicy dark berry note, with very good thrust and length.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Viticultores San Juan Bobal deSanjuan (Utiel-Requena, Valencia)\u00a0 $13\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Bobal deSanjuan (red) was harvested from September 27, picked from organically grown vines. The nose is well defined with pressed flowers, crushed stone and a touch of balsamic. The palate is fresh and natural with good acidity, hints of mulberry and briary fruit with a very cool, Rh\u00f4ne-like finish that is pure and focused. This is a bright, breezy Bobal that is very well made. Drink now-2017.<\/p> <p><b>2006 Escoces Volante 3000 A\u00f1os (Bullas, Murcia)\u00a0 $20<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The[masked] A\u00f1os is a splendid example of old-vine Monastrell (50%) blended with 50% Syrah from the little-known D.O. of Bullas. It was aged for 12 months in 500-liter new French oak with batonnage by rotation of the barrels. Opaque purple-colored, it delivers a brooding, very Proven\u00e7al nose of cedar, garrigue, violets, lavender, blueberry, and blackberry. This leads to a layered, ripe, structured, strapping wine with enough tannin to evolve for 6-8 years. The wine has more than enough fruit to provide balance and the finish is long and pure.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Sedella Laderas de Sedella\u00a0 (M\u00e1laga)\u00a0 $18\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91 \u2013 <\/i>In 2008, Lauren Rosillo planted 0.9 hectares with the same field-blend found in the original Sedella vineyard: Rom\u00e9, Garnacha, Ja\u00e9n (Menc\u00eda), (white) Montua and Moscatel Romano. He tried to replicate the old vineyard as much as possible on this plot located at 800 meters on a north-facing slope on slate soils. This first 2012 Laderas de Sedella also followed a very similar process, with all the grapes harvested and fermented together in stainless steel. But in this case, malolactic fermentation was carried out in a combination of oak and cement amphorae where the wine matured for 12 months without racking. The nose is a combination of flowers, Mediterranean herbs, pollen, beeswax and red berries. The palate is medium-bodied, with great acidity, very tasty, elegant and with very fine-grained tannins. Great value. 1,912 bottles produced.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group\/events\/225617070\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Mediterranean Spain","id":"225617070","time":1444086000000,"updated":1444349559000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432265288000,"name":"NYC Gay Men's Wine Dinner Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18616490,"urlname":"NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":" 212-677-8621","address_1":"123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th & 13th streets)","name":"CRS (Center for Remembering & Sharing)","lon":-73.989868,"id":346140,"state":"NY","lat":40.733528,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":1.14061510563,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1376528507000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crsny.org\/drupal\/en\/events\/healing-clinic\">A Course in Miracles Healing Clinic at CRS<br\/><\/a> Mon. &amp; Tue. 7 \u2013 7:40 pm<br\/>and 12 \u2013 1 pm before monthly Miracles in Manhattan lectures (usually 2nd Sun of the month)<br\/><i>Suggested donation $20.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

You need to bring together device connectivity, data integration and management, data analytics, cloud, and mobility all in a way that works seamlessly together and intuitively for all the members of your business. That\u2019s why GE created Predix. In the connected world, GE field engineers work in places where offline is the norm. This presentation will examine how the Predix Experience engineering team built a platform for building applications for the industrial workforce and how Couchbase Mobile complements GE\u2019s Offline First approach. We will look at what Offline First means and how the platform\u2019s offline capabilities were replaced with Couchbase Mobile in less than 90 days.<\/p> <p><b>Agility with Data Modeling at DIRECTV Using N1QL<\/b><br\/>Today\u2019s companies are challenged to change rapidly and while maintaining high quality standards.

In particular, JavaScript offers an end-to-end solution \u2013 from the user\u2019s web browser to the JSON object stored in the database. By integrating Couchbase into the picture, the performance and flexibility offered by projects with these technologies will become the next big thing: fast paced development, agile changes, high performance, easily scalable, and feature rich.

See Couchbase Server 4.0 in action.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Offline First: How GE Integrated Couchbase Mobile in Less Than 90 Days<\/b><br\/>Today\u2019s innovative software is providing new ways for industrial companies to gain a competitive advantage. But harnessing that potential from scratch isn\u2019t easy. You need to bring together device connectivity, data integration and management, data analytics, cloud, and mobility all in a way that works seamlessly together and intuitively for all the members of your business. That\u2019s why GE created Predix. In the connected world, GE field engineers work in places where offline is the norm. This presentation will examine how the Predix Experience engineering team built a platform for building applications for the industrial workforce and how Couchbase Mobile complements GE\u2019s Offline First approach. We will look at what Offline First means and how the platform\u2019s offline capabilities were replaced with Couchbase Mobile in less than 90 days.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Agility with Data Modeling at DIRECTV Using N1QL<\/b><br\/>Today\u2019s companies are challenged to change rapidly and while maintaining high quality standards. Managing Entity\u2013relationship models has become a constraint to these objectives. Now, NoSQL solutions and dynamic languages are offering a simplified approach to modeling real world objects. In particular, JavaScript offers an end-to-end solution \u2013 from the user\u2019s web browser to the JSON object stored in the database. By integrating Couchbase into the picture, the performance and flexibility offered by projects with these technologies will become the next big thing: fast paced development, agile changes, high performance, easily scalable, and feature rich. This presentation is about the benefits and challenges of an architecture based on: Node.js, Couchbase and N1QL.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Introducing N1QL: Query Without Compromise<\/b><br\/>This session introduces Couchbase\u2019s query language for JSON, N1QL, and sets the stage for the rich selection of N1QL-related sessions at Couchbase Connect 2015. N1QL extends the querying power of SQL with the modeling flexibility of JSON. In this session, Couchbase\u2019s Chief Architect of Query, Gerald Sangudi will give you an introduction to the N1QL language, architecture, and ecosystem. Hear the benefits of N1QL for developers and for enterprises.<\/p> <p><b>The conference venue will be at Cipriani Wall Street<\/b>, which stands as a triumph of Greek revival architecture, as well as a grand and luxurious venue for events.

This is one of the easiest boards\u00a0you can\u00a0use to build connected gadgets and I'll show you how to get started and integrate your gadgets with Azure cloud connectivity. This is an awesome session for beginner or veteran makers alike.

Connectivity is a key component in IoT. Without it, all you have is a normal \u201cthing\u201d that is always offline. Connecting devices isn\u2019t always easy however, requiring custom chips, boards or shields and their associated drivers &amp; libraries. A new generation of maker boards is now emerging \u2013 many thanks to successful crowdfunding campaigns \u2013 featuring built-in wireless hardware and everything you need to easily connect to the cloud. One of the most popular of such boards is the Particle Photon (formerly known as Spark, see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.particle.io\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.particle.io\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.particle.io<\/a><\/a>) which features a built-in Wi-Fi in a small &amp; affordable package. The Photon is a $19 development kit for creating Wi-Fi connected products, and the spiritual sequel of the Spark Core. Particle uses Wiring, the same code framework as Arduino.<\/p> <p>This session is your introduction to building connected IoT gadgets with Particle hardware. We\u2019ll explore the hardware &amp; shield options, and the software platform used to program it, including both the Web and desktop IDEs. We\u2019ll cover device setup, the command-line interface, and debugging tools. Next we\u2019ll look at common maker scenarios and we\u2019ll connect our gadgets to Azure \u2013 including Event Hubs and Mobile App Services \u2013 and integrate our cloud solutions with Particle\u2019s REST API. Beginner and veteran makers are welcome to join.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/3\/2\/600_442292050.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (@ActiveNick) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.
