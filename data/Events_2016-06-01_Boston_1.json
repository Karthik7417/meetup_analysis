The evening kicks off with a fermentation-inspired vegetarian kimchi Syrian pie (with gluten free &amp; vegan options) + a selection of sides.

Join this session to see how to use Kubernetes to launch, manage, and rolling-upgrade a fleet of Java application instances with session replication.<\/p> <p>Kubernetes builds on top of Docker to construct a clustered container scheduling service. Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on, which we think of more as \"scheduling\" than \"orchestration\". Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers.<\/p> <p>In this session, you'll learn: - How to containerize different Java-based microservice workloads using Docker and different build tool plugins - Deploying and managing a fleet of Java-based microservices in Kubernetes - Service discovery 101 in Kubernetes - Perform critical DevOps steps, such as canary, rolling update, roll backs... - Tips and tricks!<\/p> <p><b><i>What's new in Kubernetes 1.2<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>I'm sure you are all excited about the fast paced progress Kubernetes is making.

They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words.

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Nonetheless, opinions do not fall along recognizable partisan lines. In her current research, Professor Diana C. Mutz uses surveys and experimental designs to explore the psychological, political, economic, and philosophical underpinnings of American attitudes toward policies such as international trade and outsourcing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mutz finds that the mass public\u2019s views of international trade are strikingly different from those of economists. Surprisingly, the public\u2019s views have little to do with the impact of trade on their personal economic well-being, let alone economists\u2019 views of trade\u2019s impact on the public. Instead, trade attitudes have more to do with attitudes toward the value of cooperation versus competition and on general attitudes toward citizens of other countries.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

She regularly engages in meditation, creative visualization and journaling and closely follows the literature on personal development. She is leaving a long career in K-12 and higher education to turn to her long-time passion for life coaching.<\/p> <p>After developing the Intuitive MoJo process she began teaching it to small groups in her home with great success.

The women and men there are building an egalitarian society based at least in part on the writings of the late Murray Bookchin, a U.S. Anarchist. They are fighting against Isis and also against capitalist nations who oppose what they are doing. Their goal is not to establish a separate nation for the Kurds, but to build a grass-roots society of neighborhoods and communities that practice real egalitarianism including between the sexes (which is especially remarkable in that part of the world). For example, all major offices in Rojava are held by two individuals, one male and one female.<\/p> <p><br\/>You can search on line for \"Rojava\" and several links will come up, including one to an article that appeared in the New York TImes Magazine last November.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

You've no doubt heard plenty about such features as Query Store, JSON support, Polybase, and the other big-ticket items. But there are also a number of very cool features that don't usually make the top 10 lists. In this talk you'll learn about enhancements to indexing (including both Columnstore and traditional b-tree indexes), DMVs, compression, string handling, encryption, configuration, and even timezone support. These smaller features may not be highlighted in the latest glossy ads from Microsoft's marketing department, but they're the kinds of things that add up to make your life easier.

Onshape is a type of parametric CAD, which is quite different than tools like SketchUp and TinkerCAD and is more similar to tools used in industry. Because it is free, easily accessible, and requires no installation, it is a great introduction into the world of professional design. We will start with the basics of 3D modeling and work our way up to more advanced modeling techniques. In addition, we will explore tools unique to Onshape, including simultaneously collaborating on a single part, version control, and best practices for managing CAD data on the cloud.

Jack is enthralled and in awe of his teacher, and, most important, willing to accept Celeste's terms for a secret relationship\u2014car rides after school; rendezvous at Jack's house while his single father works late; body-slamming encounters in Celeste's empty classroom between periods.<\/p> <p>Ever mindful of the danger\u2014the perpetual risk of exposure, Jack's father's own attraction to her, and the ticking clock as Jack leaves innocent boyhood behind\u2014the hyperbolically insatiable Celeste bypasses each hurdle with swift thinking and shameless determination, even when the solutions involve greater misdeeds than the affair itself. In slaking her sexual thirst, Celeste Price is remorseless and deviously free of hesitation, a monstress driven by pure motivation. She deceives everyone, and cares nothing for anyone or anything but her own pleasure.<\/p> <p><br\/>With crackling, rampantly unadulterated prose,\u00a0Tampa\u00a0is a grand, uncompromising, seriocomic examination of want and a scorching literary debut.\"<\/p> <p>via goodreads<\/p> <p>Please support our host restaurant!

If you struggle with staying on beat\/rhythm,you know very little about combination, musicality, or this is a new experience for you I will highly suggest level 1.

Beginning on Wednesday evening May 25th and continuing for about 8 weeks we will meet at Zipcar to review our work together as a group.

Which explains why most of us avoid developing one. They're typically about 30 seconds, which approximates a typical attention span. Or does it?<\/p> <p>Finally, here's a reason to throw away your elevator pitch (if you even have one).<\/p> <p>Melanson believes they're too long, they provide description [vs position against the competition], and it's not a strategy to continue thru the rest of the conversation. \u201cBranding books don\u2019t recognize that the most important branding moments are conversations,\u201d\u00a0 he explains.<\/p> <p>What's the answer?\u00a0 Great verbal branding is direct, honest, and moves action. We'll learn how to intrigue our listener instead of losing their attention. Ever have that sinking feeling of watching your words fly past him\/her?<\/p> <p>Stephen Melanson is an entertaining and dynamic speaker. We'll start working on our personal branding statements in the previous meetup (May 25), and refine and revise them with Melanson at the special June 8 session.\u00a0 The lessons you learn will stick with you for a long time to come.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ........................<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Our Regular Wed, May 11 Meetup:<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>If you're new to Speak Up Cambridge, what should you expect from our usual meetups?<\/p> <p>Learn valuable do's and don'ts for addressing an audience.

If your hand is unintentionally mucked because you didn't protect it, there is no recourse, and the hand is dead. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>-Verbally declared actions are binding. Tapping the table is considered a check. An unintentional action will be forgiven only once\/night. Rules must be enforced fairly with all players, regardless of experience level. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>-No string bets or splashed pots.<\/p> <p>-Don't discuss hands as they are ongoing. Talking about hands or action is allowed only are when heads up, and only by the 2 players remaining in the pot.<\/p> <p>-Hands must remain on table or not more than 12 inches from the edge of the table and must be visible to all players.<\/p> <p>-Everyone makes mistakes but strive to pay attention so you act in turn in a timely fashion. If you have trouble knowing when it's your turn, let me know, and I'll help you with a reminder.<\/p> <p>-If you are in a hand or on the button (dealing), you are not allowed to be on your phone. -Host's decisions on rulings are final.<\/p> <p>-Once a player is done dealing, s\/he must move the button to the next dealer.<\/p> <p>-Cut-off shuffles, then passes the shuffled deck to the small blind to be ready for next deal.<\/p> <p>-Rule violations that influence the course of a hand will be dealt with as follows: First time=warning, Second time=dealt out for next hand. Third time=dealt out for a round. Again, everyone makes mistakes, but an awareness of the game is important.

All are welcome to join us, regardless of experience level!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have a game you are particularly interested in playing, you are welcome and encouraged to bring it. But this is not required; many people typically bring a selection of their favorites and we're always happy to teach. The only things you need to bring are an open mind and a good attitude. If you're particularly hot to try something out, you are encouraged to leave a comment and see if you can drum up some interest beforehand. Please bear in mind that table space is limited, so an especially huge or epic game may not be appropriate for the venue (but see our Sunday night event at Pandemonium in Central Square for an alternative venue).<\/p> <p><br\/>The event officially opens at 7 PM, but some people like to show up early; those who show up early should feel free to get started on a shorter warm-up game if time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/>We look forward to seeing you at the gaming table!<\/p> <p><br\/>WHERE WE SIT: Unless the restaurant is super-crowded, we gather in the basement dining area; just look for the games and say hi. We're friendly, honest!<\/p> <p><br\/>GETTING THERE:<\/p> <p><br\/>The Panera is located within easy walking distance of the Red Line T and several bus lines, and public transit is probably the easiest way of getting there. If you drive, mall parking is (theoretically) limited to 2 hours except where posted. I've never heard of anyone getting towed for overstaying this limit. For the extra-cautious, there are metered spots on Mass Ave; check the meter to be sure but most Cambridge meters don't need to be fed after 6 PM or 7 PM. There is also a Hubway bike-share station less than five minute's walk from the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>SOME NOTES:<\/p> <p><br\/>As a group, we don't usually make a huge deal about attendance policy, however: attendance at these events is limited, and our Panera events are usually not huge; one side effect of this is that RSVPing and then not showing up can have a disruptive effect on our events, and for particularly popular events, \"no shows\" take up a spot from someone who wanted to be there. Bottom line: If you RSVP for a Panera event, please make a good-faith effort to show up or at least let us know if you can't make it.<\/p> <p><br\/>As far as possible, please also let us know if you're going to be more than a few minutes late. As a rule of thumb, if we haven't heard from you and you arrive after 7:15 or so, you're likely to be limited to a spot at whatever game has room for an extra player. Much later than that, and we'll almost certainly be underway without you! You're welcome to show up and socialize and of course we'll try to accomodate you if we can, but we can't guarantee you a game. Because we as a group tend to play longer and more involved games, most groups at our events tend to play one and only one game per night.<\/p> <p><br\/>Panera has been quite gracious about hosting our group with minimal fuss. To ensure that this happy state of affairs continues, please give them some business if you're hungry or thirsty and (especially) respect the hardworking people who work there, and their desire to go home after a long shift -- be ready to leave when the restaurant closes at ten.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/230672120\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Wednesday Gaming In Porter Square","id":"rgfbqlyvhbpb","time":1463007600000,"updated":1463019904000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"25 St. Mary's Court","name":"CommonWealth Center for Holistic Herbalism","lon":-71.10743,"id":23555415,"state":"MA","lat":42.346603,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.12818074226,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462374794000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Psychological injury and pain are as much in need of relief as phsyical hurts.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

From running resource-heavy applications to hosting your entire desktop infrastructure in the cloud - only\u00a0yesterday, all this was impossible. But the proliferation of technologies and increased VDI adoption rates also introduce new security issues. Benefits offered by VDI include data security (no critical data on remote\/mobile devices), hardware agnosticism, flexible control over the working environment and easy, centralized, applications provisioning. Retaining the user experience delivered by physical workstations, with fast response times and similar working patterns, is usually a prerequisite, but thanks to VDI solutions (such as VMware Horizon View) this in fully attainable. However, the benefits of virtualization can easily be eroded if the specifics of such systems are not taken into full account. And with virtualized infrastructures offering attack surfaces directly comparable to those of their physical counterparts, this is particularly true when it comes to protection. Many vendors do offer specialized solutions for virtualized environments. But these tend to show their shortcomings when it comes to desktop environments. Resource consumption, for example, or lack of specific protective capabilities (such as controlling processes in RAM), make many virtualization security solutions unsuitable for protecting VDIs. Specific usage scenarios can also introduce challenges - so that even the most conventional malware attacks can have severe effects. Further VDI proliferation and the centralization of valuable data storage will inevitably attract increased interest from cybercriminals. Potentially terrifying Proof-of-Concept attack scenarios could soon become our new realities. Understanding this, Kaspersky Lab's virtualization security solution offers a technology specifically designed to address such issues: the Light Agent. While avoiding VDI bottlenecks, the technology offers a full spectrum of multi-layered protection for virtualized workstations and supports the vast majority of known usage scenarios.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>8:45-\u00a0Cleanup and prizes\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Swag Alert !!<br\/>(Hint - Don't miss this one!) \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/a\/1\/600_449330081.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/virtg.com\/default.aspx","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VirtGBoston\/events\/230633074\/","yes_rsvp_count":58,"duration":10800000,"name":"Hyperconvergence 3.0 with SimpliVity & Security with Kaspersky Lab","id":"230633074","time":1463090400000,"updated":1463581456000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334498408000,"name":"Virtualization Meetup Group\u2013Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":3673212,"urlname":"VirtGBoston","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":125,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861012935638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455654428000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi All,<\/p> <p>Only two more days until the event!

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

This is happening: First up, it's Mister Bismuth - The collective minds of sexually adventurous sketch group Mister Bismuth bring you the latest in their special brand of humor, making you laugh, cry, and question everything. From their short films Bleak Moments and Inexorable, to their runs at SketchHaus, Miyamoto's Revenge and Super Gay Comedy Fun Time, this group will have you rolling in the aisles. Maybe from joy, maybe from diarrhea. Pepto not provided.<\/p> <p>THEN YOUR HEADLINER! Ike &amp; Clark - Sam Ike and Laura Clark are best friends despite having very little in common. The show they do together is a mix of stand up, storytelling and sketches about love, death, sex, racism, feminism and Drake songs. Your host is the brilliant and hilarious Niraj Shah! Our special guest star is the equally hilarious Liam McGurk! Produced by Kevin Quigley, the guy writing this promo. A slopton of sketch and comedy for only $12.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The question is not as ridiculous as it seems. When Plato appears at Google headquarters, he makes a strong case that just as you trust the straightening of your teeth to an orthodontist, it makes sense to trust the straightening of your path to a philosopher. But no sooner does Plato convince us, than a Google employee and Plato's book-tour manager (neither one a philosopher) make compelling cases for other views. Their Socratic debate is a literary and philosophical tour de force that you will not soon forget.<\/p> <p>To set it up, author Rebecca Goldstein provides a chapter of scholarly background, which we will also discuss.

It\u2019s a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation\u2014a place where everyone gets to say the truth and feel heard.

You don't have to do anything you don't want to, or answer any questions you don't want to answer.

Longfellow visited the Wayside Inn in 1862, when it was called the \"How Tavern\". In his book \"Tales of a Wayside Inn\", Longfellow re-published his poem \"Paul Revere's Ride\" as \"The Landlord's Tale\".<\/p> <p>Henry Ford was the last private owner of the Wayside Inn. He purchased it in 1923, and he also purchased 3,000 acres of land surrounding the Inn, with the aim of developing it into a historically oriented village and museum. Although his original aims were not accomplished at the Wayside, he did establish the non-profit institution that operates the Inn and associated museum, watermill, and archives today.<\/p> <p>Less well known is Ford's attempt to create a reservoir for the Wayside Inn. Across US Rte. 20 and now secluded in a wooded area behind private homes is a 30 ft. high stone dam. Dubbed by the locals as \"Ford's Folly\" the structure failed to retain water because the feeding brook provided insufficient volume and the ground was too porous for a pond to fill.<\/p> <p><b>After Hike, Food and Drinks:<\/b><\/p> <p>After the hike, we will gather for food and drinks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Conrad\u2019s Restaurant<br\/>120 Boston Post Rd, Sudbury, MA<\/p> <p><b>RSVP Responsibility!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Only RSVP if you can go and update your RSVP (don't wait until the day of the event) if you can't make it.<\/p> <p>I am only a volunteer.

After all bags have been thrown, a bag remaining on the board is worth 1 point. A bag that went in the hole is worth 3 points. Add up how many points you earned and compare them to your opponents. Equal points cancel each other out so that only one team can score per round. For example, if you scored 5 points and your opponent scored 3, you will add 2 points to your overall score and your team will throw first in the next round. If you scored 6 points and your opponent scored 6 as well, there will be no points awarded and whoever threw first in the last round will throw first again. A game is won when a team reaches 21 points with a lead of 2 or more points.

Learning to see creatively means slowing down to notice simple details right in front of you the have the potential to make a great photo. The things other people walk right by will suddenly jump out at you begging for your attention.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/8\/4\/600_449874916.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0I will introduce you to some simple step by step practices for creative seeing so you can find beauty in the most unexpected places. I will show you some inspiring example photos to help get you started. I will help challenge your assumptions about what makes an interesting photo.<\/p> <p>I have designed a series of three specific assignments to challenge your creativity and get you out of your habitual ways of seeing. We will start with macro, then mid range and end with landscapes. You will also have some free time to just wander on your own or with a photo buddy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/7\/b\/600_449874907.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nYou will have a chance to try these out right away with my guidance out on the grounds. \u00a0You will receive individual coaching and critique while we are in the field shooting.

As always, this is a non technical jargon zone. It is all about the creative act of seeing and capturing the moments of life with a fresh eye. There is a sudden sense of discovery when you get a glimpse of nature in this way.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/e\/600_363303422.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This workshop is for you if:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You want to develop your eye to see beyond the basic, obvious images.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You would like to go off auto and explore depth of field with aperture priority.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Your photos are \u201cnice\u201d but not jaw dropping all that often.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 You would like to go beyond the basics of composition and learn more advanced ways of composing your images using dynamic tension and harmony.<\/p> <p>Taking better photos takes practice and with guidance the you know what to focus on and how to see with the creative eye of an art photographer.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am very excited about offering this intensive workshop.

He wasn't born a soldier, but the English had press-ganged some of his closest friends into slavery on their warships, stolen his family's livelihood, and set his home of Salem, Massachusetts, on the path to financial ruin. Like many other merchants, fishermen, and ship owners, Webb and his crew outfitted whatever boats they could find to fight the English during the War of 1812, and the 70-foot\u00a0Fame\u00a0was no exception. The original\u00a0Fame\u00a0went on 11 more journeys before being wrecked in 1814 and now lives on as a luxurious home for the retired actors ofThe Little Mermaid.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/4\/c\/600_448918956.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/e\/7\/600_448918855.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/e\/2\/600_448918850.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/c\/600_448918844.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/d\/7\/600_448918839.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\nSome of the things you may see during our sail are:<\/p> <p><br\/>Salem from the water!Winter IslandFort PickeringFive lighthouses: Derby Wharf, Fort Pickering, Hospital Point, Baker's Island and Marblehead NeckMagnificent waterfront homes in Beverly and MarbleheadThe outlying islands: Misery, Baker's, Eagle, Children's, and the RockAnd you'll see them from a beautifully maintained\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>authentic wooden schooner<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0which personifies Salem's storied past.<\/p> <p>\n\nTake the tiller, help raise the sails, or just sit back and watch the world glide past.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>It's a different world out on the water.<\/b><\/p> <p>What Is Not Included?<\/p> <p><b>Food and beverages<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0are not included, but are for sale on board at reasonable prices.\u00a0 We offer beer, wine, soft drinks, water and assorted snacks.\u00a0Guests are encouraged to bring their own snacks and sandwiches, but no alcohol can be brought on board due to state regulations.<\/p> <p><br\/>Meeting LocationPickering Wharf Marina (Salem, MA)(Exact meeting location details will be provided immediately upon purchase of tickets.)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"$21   for one   ($35 value)   $39  for two on the schooner Fame ($70 value)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/230399714\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Salem Triple (Schooner Ride) - \"Fame\" - Salem, MA","id":"230399714","time":1463256000000,"updated":1463496792000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02026","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Dedham","address_1":"150 Bridge St, Rte 109","lon":-71.176997,"phone":"781-326-9616","name":"McGolf","id":908372,"state":"MA","lat":42.26328,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":8.65169906616,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460425328000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>**<\/b>*Please check back for weather updates.

The cost is usually around $12-20\/person (not including any drinks for which people pay their own way). \u00a0We are open to restaurant suggestions. \u00a0However, I am not willing to get into dividing up large numbers of orders on one giant check, which is why we generally go to Chinatown and split everything down the middle. \u00a0If you don't want to eat at all, you can come and just enjoy the company for free. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Please BRING CASH if you can and want to go to dinner - many of the restaurants limit cards to two per table, so if a lot of people have no cash it can be a problem.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/d\/a\/600_446055322.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Stuart Street view<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/1\/2\/600_446055378.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We usually have several tables pulled together at the highest point of the food court nearest the elevator.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-japanese\/events\/230603190\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":7200000,"name":"Saturday Social Meetup at City Place","id":"zbclplyvhbsb","time":1463256000000,"updated":1463264016000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1042101769000,"name":"Boston Japanese & English Language Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":86694,"urlname":"boston-japanese","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Japanese\/English Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02420","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lexington","address_1":"13 Depot Square","name":"Lexington Depot","lon":-71.227913,"id":4464152,"state":"MA","lat":42.448357,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":80,"headcount":0,"distance":10.129029274,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462411551000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Personal Growth Network is a personal growth community that brings people, ideas and passion together in\u00a0many different ways. \u00a0This event is one more way to support one another ... directly ... helping each person to find what they are looking for.<\/p> <p>Come with an idea of at least one thing you want support on.\u00a0 And leave with lots of support from people who can help you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here are some examples of what you may desire...<br\/>- create a support group on X<br\/>- find a job in Y<br\/>- find a wealth consultant<br\/>- find a client who wants coaching on Z\u00a0<br\/>- find an investor for your business<br\/>- find a therapist\/coach who handles A\u00a0<br\/>- find a buddy to explore B\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About Dennis Pratt:<\/b><\/p> <p>Dennis\u00a0Pratt is the founder and chef r\u00e9alisateur des r\u00e8ves of the Personal Growth Network.\u00a0 He is looking for plenty of things in his life, including more speaking opportunities and more leaders who will help him build the most vibrant, most active, most supportive, and most transformative personal growth community in the world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>**************************************************<\/p> <p><b>Enjoy the full day mini-Expo and Social for only: $10\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Make sure you secure a spot before it sells out!<\/p> <p>Save money and\u00a0pay ahead of time\u00a0for the full day and night:\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/PUYL-MU051416\">bit.ly\/PUYL-MU051416<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>(Price at the door: $15)<\/p> <p>Dennis' miniWorkshop is just one offering during our all-day PUYL mini-Expo. \u00a0You can enjoy this miniWorkshop, as well as the many other miniWorkshops, and the party afterwards, for one low price. \u00a0(The Power Up Your Life miniExpo takes place 12:45 -7:30, and the Social is 7:30-10:30 pm.)<\/p> <p>This event is being announced at lots of other places.

We will walk across the street to the North Point Park as we make our way through the park taking photos we will go under the zakim bridge and then to the Charlestown bridge to take photos. Afterwards we will walk down to the Lovejoy Wharf stopping to take more photos before crossing the walkway at the locks. After crossing the walkway we will continue to take photos under the zakim bridge and then returning to North Point Park in darkness. My best estimate is the total round trip is no more than 1.5 miles. Great locations to photograph the zakim bridge. The museum of science is easy access by the t and parking can be found at the Museum or at the CambridgeSide Galleria.<\/p> <p>Remember: we are volunteers.

That's why we have Laughing Liberally Boston, a monthly progressive political comedy show featuring some Boston\u2019s top liberal and progressive comedians. Comedians on the May 14th bill include: Christine An, Phoebe Angle, Scott Kremer, Pamela Ross, and Jiayong Li. Hosted by Matthew Filipowicz.<\/p> <p>In addition to some of the finest progressive comedians Boston has to offer, each Laughing Liberally Boston show will feature a special interview segment with a local political figure, journalist or activist. This month\u2019s guest is Karen Chen. Karen is the co-director of the Chinese Progressive Association, a grassroots community organization working for full equality and and empowerment of Boston's Chinese community and against gentrification in Boston's Chinatown.

It evolved from the Duxbury Beach Association, which was created in 1919 when a small group of summer residents led by Frederick S. Pratt bought the beach. The Reservation\u2019s statement of purpose clearly defines the purposes of the charitable corporation: \u201c. . . to restore and to preserve the beaches in so far as reasonably possible in their natural state as host to marine life, native and migratory birds and indigenous vegetation, as barrier beaches for the protection of Duxbury and Kingston and as a priceless environmental asset to the Commonwealth and the nation; and to operate for the benefit of the people of Duxbury and the general public a public recreational beach with all necessary and incidental facilities, while preserving the right to limit and regulate such use so as to be consistent with the corporation\u2019s primary ecological objective.<\/p> <p>Since its incorporation in 1975, the Reservation has taken its mission very seriously. To maintain a barrier against the sea, it has added sand to the beach in two dune projects and numerous repairs, then stabilized the new sand with fencing and beach grass. To preserve the natural heritage of the beach, it has developed comprehensive programs to protect vegetation and wildlife. To operate a public recreational beach within the confines of these ecological objectives, as well as state and federal regulations, the Reservation has always relied on the cooperation of beach goers and the assistance of the town of Duxbury.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/f\/4\/600_436676308.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>No dogs and no guests <\/b>are allowed on hikes.

About the speaker: \"Abby Hafer is a speaker, writer and humorist who particularly loves taking on Intelligent Design, Creationism, the politics surrounding them, and science denialism in general.<\/p> <p>\"A few years ago, she realized that Intelligent Design is a political pressure group, not a scientific issue. With this figured out, she realized that what we need are political-style arguments in defense of evolution. Her presentations contain bulletproof science, but are short, easy to understand, easy to repeat, and make the opposition look bad. She uses humor to puncture bad arguments. Crucial questions are raised, such as \"Why do mens' testicles have such a bad location?\" and \"Who does God like better, us\u2014or squid? Once she mentions testicles, everybody pays attention.<\/p> <p>\"Her book The Not-So-Intelligent Designer\u2014Why Evolution Explains the Human Body and Intelligent Design Does Not which was published in 2015.<\/p> <p>\"Dr. Hafer has a doctorate in zoology from Oxford University, and teaches human anatomy and physiology at Curry College.\"<\/p> <p>Learn more about Dr. Hafer from her appearance on the Nontheology podcast -- <a href=\"https:\/\/nontheology.com\/2014\/11\/30\/abby-hafer-unintelligent-design\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/nontheology.com\/2014\/11\/30\/abby-hafer-unintelligent-design\/<\/a>.

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

Prince is the name that my mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros... I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was the Love Symbol, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name.\"<br\/><\/i><br\/>So to use that trite expression, what's in a name? What do names come to mean to us? Do you like your name? Hate it? Do you want to (or have you) changed it? Some countries (like Denmark) have rules that the name you choose for your baby has to be on an approved list or be approved by a government board. Is your name entirely yours, or is it something that is shared with others as a linguistic representation of you? How do you feel about nicknames - camaraderie building, or hurtful and marginalizing?<\/p> <p>Let's discuss...hope to see you there :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/food-for-thought-boston\/events\/230568091\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Names and what they mean to us","id":"230568091","time":1463351400000,"updated":1463422807000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297019838000,"name":"Food for Thought","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1779272,"urlname":"food-for-thought-boston","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02143","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"415 Washington St","lon":-71.10639,"phone":"(617) 661-3254","name":"Dali Restaurant & Tapas Bar","id":669359,"state":"MA","lat":42.378284,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.25113201141,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460992037000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Change in plans...

The advantage to this gem is that you're right in the middle of all the action. You will be able to walk to many of the activities you're looking for. This house is not a definite. It depends on how many people sign up and how quickly, which is why I am eager to get this ball rolling.

they can select some approaches for more in-depth study and application to their lives; they can practice, support, and share a particular approach with other members; and they can return to PGN to explore different approaches or to work on other parts of their life. \u00a0<\/p> <p>PGN is also a community of like-hearted people who share an important, but not widely distributed, combination of values and characteristics (e.g.,\u00a0curiosity, willingness to learn,\u00a0willingness\u00a0to change habits)\u00a0around consciously and proactively crafting a life well-lived. \u00a0For people with this important combination of characteristics, engaging with other members of the community can be fascinating, supportive, and affirming.<\/p> <p>PGN is a toolbox with which members can create successful events. \u00a0Members can create workshops, practice groups, and social events through which they can\u00a0share their journey, their gifts, their joy, their successes, their vision, and their interests.<\/p> <p>And finally, PGN is a marketplace, where leaders uncover numerous ways to serve more people more profoundly and more effectively. \u00a0They\u00a0can offer their service broadly, discover and try out new techniques, tools and approaches, find out what works best\u00a0for them, and iterate towards excellence.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Orientation Series<\/b><\/p> <p>Given the enormous ambition and power of the Personal Growth Network, and its rapid growth, it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed at first, so we offer some \"How-To\" guides to maximize your utilization of the Personal Growth Network for whatever your goals may be. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Our Orientations include:<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>For Participants<\/i>\u00a0<br\/><\/b>- Newbie Introduction:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/230141117\/\">Thu Jun 16<br\/><\/a>. . . . . . . . .

This is more for member's information and is not meant to sound that I am angry. Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large. Oh and add to that I spend 30+ hours every week of my own time running the group which I get paid $0 for.<\/p> <p>Please help keep the group going. Don\u2019t let not giving $11 a year, every year stop all the fun. Oh and you don\u2019t have to pay the $11 online you can pay the $10 in person or e-mail me to pay by check.<\/p> <p>If you want to pay online Meetup has shut down the Amazon payment feature so you can now pay using Paypal and pay $11 to my PayPal account using e-mail address which is <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"mailto:[masked]\"&gt;===================================<\/a><\/p> <p>With PayPal, you can send money to anyone with an email address.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how to send money:<\/p> <p>Log in to your PayPal account.<\/p> <p><br\/>Click Send money to a friend at the top of the page.<\/p> <p>Type the email address or mobile number to whom you are sending money, and the\u00a0amount being sent.

International refugee law protects only the refugees: those fleeing across borders due to a well-founded persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. The world's other 42.3 million people displaced by violence have few protections under international law.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This presentation will argue that the refugee and migration crisis has resulted not only from intractable violence, but from the world's failure to manage it. It will then propose and sketch new international law to address this crucial human rights problem. A new Displaced Persons Convention would better protect the human rights of individuals fleeing violent conflict and state failure, further state interests, and improve international security.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Contact: ISP Program Coordinator, International Security Program - 79 John F.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

What started with dj-ing and dropping parties at the time house music entered nightlife (at the same time he did), is now a full specialism. As a journalist, Mark has been writing about dance music and party culture since 2000 (newspapers, magazines and now for his own founded blog Our House). He interviewed most of the key players in the scene and visited dozens of major events \u2013 mainstream and underground.In 2013 he released his first book: \u2018Dutch Dance\u2019, about 25 years of the infamous scene in his country. This first overview story of dance music\/culture in The Netherlands was rewarded with the Pop Media Price, the most important award for music journalism in Holland. Since 2014, Mark is also a lecturer on Dance Industry at Academy for Creative Industries in his hometown Tilburg. He runs the Dutch Dance Industry Lab, in which all dance related activities of this high quality, internationally focused academy are collected.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/togetherboston.com\/\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>Follow Together on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/together\"&gt;Twitter<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/togetherboston\/\">Instagram<\/a>, &amp;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TogetherBoston\">Facebook<\/a>!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/togetherboston.com\/2016-schedule\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mmmmaven\/events\/230851765\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":3600000,"name":"AMERICA & THE NETHERLANDS: A HISTORY OF DANCE MUSIC","id":"230851765","time":1463436000000,"updated":1463441696000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420320712000,"name":"Mmmmaven","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18296076,"urlname":"mmmmaven","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Mmmmaniacs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"1154 Boylston Street","lon":-71.08993,"phone":"(617) 536-1608","name":"Massachusetts Historical Society","id":631419,"state":"MA","lat":42.346428,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.3866301775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462228907000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Jefferson the Architect<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Registration required.
