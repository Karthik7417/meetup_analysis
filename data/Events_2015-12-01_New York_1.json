Note - lockers are quite small so if you have a lot of stuff or wear size 13 shoes like me, you may need to use two lockers - so bring two locks.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost:<\/b><br\/>Access to the ice skating rink is free, and so is the use of lockers (you need to bring your lock!).<br\/>However, the ice-skates rental is not free.<br\/>If you have a pair of ice skates, then you won't pay a dime; but if you do not have your own ice-skates, and can't borrow them from a friend\/relative, you'll have to rent them at the facility for $15 for a skating period (you can stay as long as you want 8AM-10PM).<br\/>If you plan on ice skating more than 2 times this season, I suggest you to purchase a pair of ice skates; there are some incredibly cheap skates out there - girls can pick up a pair for as low as $30...<br\/>Just make sure they fit you OK (thigh but not blistering tight), get the cheapest pair, and disregard all selling points salesman will try to put out there...<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Transportation:<\/b><br\/>Getting to the Bryant park is easy.<br\/>Take subway line B,D,F or M to the 42nd Street - Bryan park stop...<br\/>or 7 line to the 5th Ave stop...<br\/>or N, R, Q, 1, 2 or 3 line to the Times Square - 42nd Street stop and walk one Ave block east.<br\/>The entrance to the ice skating rink is from the south side of the park - 40th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues.<\/p> <p><b>What to wear:<\/b><br\/>What usually works best for me is a base layer top (thin, body tight, moisture wick shirt) with a warm sweater on the top, a scarf, a warm hat, and a pair of gloves; everything else stays in the locker - it could be a bit cold at first, but as soon as you start skating you'll start rolling your sleeves up; Again, this is what works for me - you may want to adjust the amount\/type of clothing to best fit your needs.<br\/>Cell phones are not permitted on the ice - if you need to make a call\/send text, you have to step off the ice.<\/p> <p><b>Checking in:<\/b><br\/>When you enter the facility you will be directed to the counter where they will ask you if you have your own skates or if you need to rent a pair, ask you to sign a waiver and give you a bracelet.<br\/>After you get the bracelet, you can proceed to the lockers area.<br\/>There are some snacks\/drinks sold at the facility but the prices are as they usually are in places like this...I recommend bringing a bottle of water\/drink and keeping it in your locker...<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/6\/8\/600_206601352.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities; per Meetup.com's Terms of Service Agreements, organizers and hike\/trip leaders are released from any and all forms of liability related to events.Full text of our liability waiver can be found on the following page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/events\/226320542\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Ice Skating @ Bryant Park *All Levels Welcome*","id":"226320542","time":1446679800000,"updated":1446691332000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1357706438000,"name":"Adventure Outlet","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6566782,"urlname":"Adventure-Outlet","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":65,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445374984000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us again as hour hosts,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thsh.com\/Attorneys\/S\/Vincent-J-Syracuse.aspx\">Vincent J.

Do feel strongly about things and have difficulty moving past your feelings? Does it take you days to process and understand what you feel? If you wish you had more emotional control and intelligence and are seeking to have a more even emotional life, this 12-week online group coaching series is for you.<\/p> <p><b>The Details<\/b><br\/>The series will begin Wednesday, October 21st, 2015, at 7:00pm EST. Live video conferences take place every Wednesday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm EST (12 sessions in total) with unlimited Q &amp; A with Pierre on the private Facebook Group Page.<\/p> <p>Session One: Understand human biology and the provenance of your emotions, from the limbic system to the release of hormones, which change your cellular structure. Learn how to manage your emotions: identify what you are feeling and legitimize your perception of pain and suffering.<\/p> <p>Session Two: Learn about the Desire to Give and the Desire to Receive: the two great impulses that create the Tao, Chi or Prana, which permeates the entire Universe. How do you enter into an exchange in a balanced manner, aligned with spiritual laws?<\/p> <p>Session Three: Fear is the result of a perception that the outside world has negative intentions toward us. It has many forms, but its roots are about fragmentation and separation. It is the loss of merger. Learn how to manage your fear and to determine if your fear is real or perceived.<\/p> <p>Session Four: When we feel emotions that trouble us, we tend to judge and repress them, or worse, try to distract and medicate ourselves into a different state of being. Emotional intelligence implies the management of emotions, both good and bad.<\/p> <p>Session Five: Love is the positive force that creates merger and blending. It allows us to overcome the basic untruth of separation in 3-D reality. Addressing self-love a with body image: How do we value ourselves, and what kinds of programs are sabotaging our self-worth and value? A look at your childhood and inner child will heal your unworthiness better than any other tool.<\/p> <p>Session Six: You can only truly love someone to the degree that you love yourself. Giving while being empty will bankrupt your emotional life for you are only giving because you think you are underserving. Sharing your love with others is the most powerful act of blending that you can do: conditional love vs. unconditional love; attachment vs preference.<\/p> <p>Session Seven: We feel positive emotions that tend to uplift and give us good feelings. However, there may be higher emotions for which we understand the dictionary definition but to which we have no actual visceral reaction. Evolve a connection to higher emotions, such as empathy, detachment, and unconditional love.<\/p> <p>Session Eight: Listening is a skill that can be learned. Often we say that we are listening. But we are in fact deep in thought or judging the individual telling the story. To listen is to observe without objections. You have to have a deep level of empathy to be able to do this effectively. Saying the Ho\u2019oponopono helps us become neutral and gives us the tolerance to listen.<\/p> <p>Session Nine: We exist in social settings, and we are interacting with each other in family, social, national, and international situations. Emotions are infectious and can be communicated without verbal clues. This is done through the amygdala in the brain. Individuals who are highly emotionally intelligent can walk into a room and change the mood of the space.<\/p> <p>Session Ten: Neutrality is not disengagement from the injustices of the world. It is a way to engage without being polarized. It is observation without objection. To listen and enhance your social intelligence, you have to listen more effectively, and nothing can increase your listening more than being neutral and observing without objections.<\/p> <p>Session Eleven: Our power to empathize is not limited to sensing other human beings. Given the right kind of consciousness, we can listen to all natural forces for they have a subtle intelligence. It is a kind of intelligence that is heartfelt, and it cannot deceive the forces of nature. They can read your heart and intention. It is a blending of two or more essences.<\/p> <p>Session Twelve: The earth is not an inert mass; rather it is a living organism with a complex series of interconnected processes and systems that balance each other to maintain organic life. Our survival on earth hinges on our assimilation of these processes and supporting the sustainable flow of them. Learn how to listen to the earth.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Find out more!

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

The northern peak is 1531ft and has a series of radio antennas on its summit. The higher southern peak is 1610ft and has a lookout tower on its summit.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226496962\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Thursday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226496962","time":1446760800000,"updated":1446772883000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 45th Street (Between 6th & 7th Ave.)","name":"Cranberry Cafe","lon":-73.94519,"id":6580602,"state":"NY","lat":40.813438,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.9805932045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423802479000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTICE: While we officially start at 5pm, please feel free to join us anytime after 5pm.

Before unseen ornamental structures are filtered through the transformative power of light. The\u00a0London Reflections series here is represented by the images \u201cSt Pauls\u2026\u201d<\/p> <p>Pieces from the\u00a0Calliope\u00a0series offer an entirely different projection of the transformative power of light through the use of infrared photography, which reflects daylight at a different frequency. Calliope, the photographer\u2019s muse, is captured using this unusual type of photography - allowing for the viewer to transcend into an ethereal otherworldliness.<\/p> <p>Other works included in this show at the General Consulate of Germany show her continued love of structure, architecture and reflective light. In the\u00a0Palais Lichtenau Enfilades\u00a0the viewer is enticed to step through the image into another world.

She is also capable of imparting manyhelpful nuggets of information about the process of singing and performing\u00a0that one doesn't usually receive from one's teacher.\u00a0I found her instruction of enormous value.<\/i>___.\u00a0P.

I am eager to do more!\u00a0Anna Bartos is knowledgeable about a broad range of musical styles and genres, acting and character development as well as singing.\u00a0I would definitely like to perform in this type of event again.

Kids who were dropped off and later picked up by a van. Do you ever wonder: Who are these kids? Whose kids are they? Who takes care of them? Shouldn\u2019t they be at school?

Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails.

Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone). Typically about 75% of attendees of this event come alone and 25% bring friends. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>There is a 1 drink minimum at this event.

Are you committed (like me), to getting hired as an actor? One of the essential tools we need to keep sharp is: great monologues. To keep our monologues fresh and kick-ass, I'm creating this meetup so we can practice with each other and be ready when opportunity knocks. Everyone will have a chance to perform at least one (two minute) monologue. Then, your peers (us) will give you feedback \/ suggested adjustments. Take 'em or leave 'em. Then you perform it again. Depending on turnout, we may each do this again with a second monologue. Unless someone has access to free professional space, I will rent space at one of the NY rehearsal studios - in which case, there'll be a small fee to cover the rental space (divide cost of space by number of attendees). So - location TBA. If successful, I'd very much like to do this regularly. So - who's in?

And we\u2019re told that in order to fix what\u2019s broken, we need to narrow our curricula, standardize our classrooms, and find news ways to measure students and teachers. But what if these \u201cfixes\u201d are making our schools worse.In Beyond Measure, we set out to challenge the assumptions of our current education story.<\/p> <p>Rather than ask why our students fail to measure up, this film asks us to reconsider the greater purpose of education. What if our education system valued personal growth over test scores? Put inquiry over mimicry? Encouraged passion over rankings? What if we decided that the higher aim of school was not the transmission of facts or formulas, but the transformation of every student? And what if this paradigm-shift was driven from the ground up? By students, parents, and educators? By all of us?<\/p> <p>In Beyond Measure, we find a revolution brewing in public schools across the country. From rural Kentucky to New York City, schools that are breaking away from an outmoded, test-driven education are shaping a new vision for our classrooms. These are schools that see critical thinking, communication, exploration, experimentation, collaboration, and creativity as the key to good education. And they are dramatically improving outcomes for children of all backgrounds. They are schools where practically every student graduates and goes on to finish college.<\/p> <p>Beyond Measure offers a positive picture of what\u2019s possible in American education when communities decide they are ready for change.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

If you brand-new to country dancing, feel free to come and watch, but you may want to wait one week until a new series begins on November 12th!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Sign in at the lobby desk and take the elevator to the 3rd floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Scottish-Country-Dancing-Meetup-Group\/events\/226427412\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"The New York Scottish Country Dancing Meetup Group End-of-series party!","id":"qqtlskytpbhb","time":1446769800000,"updated":1446782027000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1250470851000,"name":"The New York Scottish Country Dancing Meetup Group","group_lon":-74,"id":1507667,"urlname":"The-New-York-Scottish-Country-Dancing-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Scottish Country Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"167 Bleecker St (between Sullivan and Thompson)","name":"The Village Lantern","lon":-74.005974,"id":11438772,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439840936000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Start the weekend with some FREE LAUGHS!!<\/p> <p><b>This Thursday at 8 PM<\/b>\u00a0<b>FREE LIVE COMEDY SHOW<\/b> at the <b>Village Lantern<\/b>, right in the heart of historic Greenwich Village!!<\/p> <p>Come w. a friend, or come solo.<\/p> <p><b>All comics performing on the show are professionals and have been featured on Comedy Central, MTV, Late Night TV (Letterman, Fallon, Conan, etc) + MORE!!

(An Event for Women Only)<\/p> <p>Charged. Vulnerable. Heated. Curious. Electric.<\/p> <p>What happened throughout our lives - how we felt the timbres of our bones shaking and that undeniable yearning to know ourselves in this world more deeply. To push ourselves further, to love ourselves more; to live what we now know to be an Orgasmic Life. Orgasm. Power. Connection. Sex. Desire. Purpose.<\/p> <p>We were touched by something wordless and visceral, impossible to explain, but harder to avoid. We argued with everything we\u2019d ever been told about how our bodies should look, how much happiness we were allowed, how our relationships were supposed to go; we worked with our minds just enough to get bodies on the mat to feel that first stroke. And from that moment, everything changed. That smallest whisper that started out as \u201cdespite the fear, i want this\u201d became \u201ci can have it, because it\u2019s my birthright\u201d.

Come on out and sip cocktails, mingle and paint a great canvas under the guidance of a master artist! During the 2 and a half hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash bar. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails. We have a fun little ice breaker game that helps everyone get to meet each other where you'll get raffle tickets for a chance to win a prize! Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p><i>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone). Typically about 75% of attendees of this event come alone and 25% bring friends. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend.<\/i><\/p> <p>There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<\/p> <p>Oh - here's a quick note to the men. Guys... this event has been called, \"A secret gem. One of the best places to meet fun, quality women in NYC\". So fellas, if you really want to meet a great woman, ditch the online dating scene and head on out to one of our painting nights!<\/p> <p>* This is a multi-Meetup group event.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atwysingleevents\/events\/226213342\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Speeddating Ages 30-42 - 2M\/1F SPOTS LEFT","id":"226213342","time":1446854400000,"updated":1446866819000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1318274900000,"name":"And That's Why You're Single Events - NYC","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":2624342,"urlname":"atwysingleevents","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"2 West 64th Street","address_2":"(At Central Park West)","lon":-73.97969,"phone":"212.874.5210","name":"New York Society for Ethical Culture","id":866701,"state":"NY","lat":40.771156,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.5610755682,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445968380000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Admission:\u00a0Suggested donation: $5, includes snacks and beverages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysec.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/Nov.%20film.jpg?itok=4lvQAi2z\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nysec.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/images\/Nov.%20film.jpg?itok=4lvQAi2z<\/a> Moderator: Chris Everett\u00a0<\/p> <p>Directed by\u00a0Peter Brook<\/p> <p>After a plane accident, 30 schoolage boys find themselves stranded on an island.

Please let the coach on deck know if it's your first time with us and feel free to message Alex Barclay ahead of time if you have any questions.

If you would like to practice with us regularly, you must become registered with US Water Polo at the silver level and pay our annual membership dues.<\/p> <p><br\/>We ask that any practice participants have some prior experience playing water polo and be able to swim a hundred yards in a row in less than two minutes. If you have a swimming background and are interested in learning water polo, please read the pdf below thoroughly and contact Alex Barclay. The coaching is typically geared to an intermediate level of play and we do work on basic skills at every practice. Everyone should be familiar with the basic rules and concepts of the game, as outlined in this\u00a0pdf:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Practices typically include a swim set and some conditioning at the beginning, drills, and scrimmaging for the last 30-45 minutes (it's also ok to sit out for the scrimmaging portion if it's your first practice). Bob or Jeff are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Tell the desk you're there for water polo.
