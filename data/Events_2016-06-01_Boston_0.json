If you can't print them in advance, you can pick them up at the media tent in the staging area.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Do I get photo credit?<\/b> If one of your photos is used in an article photo credit will be given to you. More about this later once you RSVP.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What kind of photos should I take? <\/b>Kelly is looking for shots of small groups of walkers and individuals.

You can download them at the Walk for Hunger Media Tent on the common that day, OR you can do some edits, select your best photos, and send the files via Drop Box a day or two after the event. Drop box is free and easy to set up.

Indeed, a 2002 British study reported that eight-year-olds could identify Pok\u00e9mon characters far more easily than they could name \"otter, beetle, and oak tree.\" Gathering thoughts from parents, teachers, researchers, environmentalists and other concerned parties, Louv argues for a return to an awareness of and appreciation for the natural world. Not only can nature teach kids science and nurture their creativity, he says, nature needs its children: where else will its future stewards come from? Louv's book is a call to action, full of warnings\u2014but also full of ideas for change. Agent, James Levine.

He entered Harvard College in the fall of 1960. He left a year before graduating to volunteer with the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project. He found a \u201ccalling\u201d as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and, in the fall of 1965, joined Cesar Chavez in his effort to unionize California farm workers. During 16 years with the United Farm Workers he gained experience in union, political, and community organizing, became Director of Organizing, and was elected to the national executive board on which he served for 8 years. During the 1980s, he worked with grassroots groups to develop new organizing programs and designed innovative voter mobilization strategies for local, state, and national electoral campaigns. In 1991, in order to deepen his intellectual understanding of his work, he returned to Harvard College and, after a 28-year \"leave of absence,\" completed his undergraduate degree in history and government. He was awarded an MPA by the Kennedy School in 1993 and completed his PhD in sociology in 2000. As senior lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, he teaches, researches, and writes on leadership, organization, and strategy in social movements, civic associations, and politics. He has published in the American Journal of Sociology, American Political Science Review, American Prospect,Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and elsewhere. His newest book, Why David Sometimes Wins: leadership, organization and strategy in the California farm worker movement was published in 2009, earning the Michael J. Harrington Book Award of the American Political Science Association.

When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure\u2019s reclusive great-uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum\u2019s most valuable and dangerous jewel.<\/p> <p>In a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then a special assignment to track the resistance. More and more aware of the human cost of his intelligence, Werner travels through the heart of the war and, finally, into Saint-Malo, where his story and Marie-Laure\u2019s converge.<\/p> <p>Doerr\u2019s \u201cstunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) are dazzling.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent.

This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening.

This free mass attunement is also actually given as our social service for those who cannot afford Reiki workshop fee but are willing to use Reiki channeling ability to help him\/herself and others.<\/p> <p>You do not need to register in advance to receive this mass attunement, just be ready during the schedule of 6.30pm local time. More details on this below.<\/p> <p>Please understand that this free attunement is not Reiki Tummo attunement, it is Usui Reiki Level 1 attunement. In term of the attunement results, it is not the same as Reiki Tummo attunement because the Usui Reiki attunements will only open upper half of your main energy channel\/sushumna (from crown chakra to heart chakra) while Reiki Tummo attunements will open the whole sushumna from crown chakra up to base chakra. However, this free Usui Reiki Level 1 attunement is given remotely by Mr. Irmansyah Effendi by means of Reiki Tummo attunement techniques, so the result is somehow better than traditional Usui Reiki attunement results.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For more detail information about the difference between Usui Reiki and Reiki Tummo attunement results, please use your yahoo email address to sign in to this group web page (<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\"><a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups<\/a><\/a>) and then visit the file section of this group or click:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/<\/a><\/a> and the file name is: AttunementComparisonUsuiReikiTummo.gif<br\/>You are welcome to explore and study other drawings there and put questions on this list.<\/p> <p>For more detail information about Reiki Tummo You can also buy Reiki Tummo book (\"REIKI TUMMO: An Effective Technique For Health and Happiness\" is written by the founder and Grandmaster of Reiki Tummo, Irmansyah Effendi, MSc.) at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/\">www.amazon.com<\/a> (ISBN:[masked])<\/p> <p>Since it is given by means of Reiki Tummo attunement technique, the result is very good for cleansing your crown chakra, heart chakra as well as palm chakras and energy channels. All alumni of Reiki Tummo workshops from Padmacahaya or Padmajaya are entitled to join and receive this free mass attunement as Reiki Tummo attunement (because you already received one before).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please read the instruction below on DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION. Also since the main benefit of the attunement is to help your heart get better connection to Divine Love and Light so your heart can be opened and cleansed better by Divine Love and Light then we suggest you to also do OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION daily before and after the attunement. Please read more information below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>May you enjoy and get benefit from this mass attunement.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Much Love and Light for your beautiful hearts, :)\u00a0<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION<br\/>Note: No need to register in advance, just be ready during the attunement.<\/p> <p>WHAT TO DO FOR A DISTANT ATTUNEMENT<\/p> <p>1. You do not need to register to receive this free mass attunement of Usui Reiki Level 1. Just prepare your self at the day of the attunement (1st of each month)\u00a0<br\/>2. No need to adjust your local time any longer. The attunement has been programmed to be received every 1st of each month at 6.30 PM YOUR OWN LOCAL TIME, where ever you are, for 15 minutes duration.\u00a0<br\/>3. Please study how to do Self Healing\/Treatment with Reiki. You can find this in some web pages or in some Reiki books. You do need to do self healing right away after the attunement is finished to make good use of the attunement energy flow that is still working on you even though the attunement is over already. Please see Note below for suggested hand positions during self healing.\u00a0<br\/>4. On the attunement day, try to get a room where you will not be disturbed. The attunement will take about 15 minutes. It is best to have a room in which the light is not too bright. If possible, have new age music and incense or aroma therapy ready. Dim light and music will help you to get relaxed easily. The incense or aroma therapy will be needed to neutralize the negative energy that will come out of you during the attunement. Remember the attunement is also a cleansing process.\u00a0<br\/>5. About 30 minutes before the attunement, it is good to start doing simple and light exercises that move most parts of your body, but don't make yourself exhausted. Simply do exercise for about 30-60 seconds for each part of the body. This will help energy flow even better in your physical body layer.\u00a0<br\/>6. Since the attunement will help opening your heart connection to Divine energy, then for better result, we suggest you to do Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation after doing simple exercises. That can be done about 15 minutes before the attunement. Please read more information on Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation below.\u00a0<br\/>7. After the simple exercises and Open Heart Prayer, get relaxed, dim the light, and turn the music on. Light incense before the attunement starts. Sit on a chair; try to keep your spine straight without forcing it. Make sure that your legs are not crossed and it is better if both feet are grounded. Put both of your hands on your thighs with your palms facing upwards. Please don't fall asleep during the attunement! :)\u00a0<br\/>8. During the attunement, simply relax. Do not make any effort to concentrate. Do not practice any breathing technique. Try to be as still as possible and enjoy whatever happens. It is a good practice to always relaxed, smile at your heart and surrender to Divine Source of Love and Light during the attunement. Also be willing to open your heart to Divine Source to receive more Divine Love and Light during the attunement. It is all done by intention only and then relaxed, smile and enjoy the attunement process. DO NOT EXPECT anything to happen since this will make you are not relaxed anymore :)\u00a0<br\/>9. After the attunement, do a complete self-healing directly. Take your time and do it properly and enjoy with smile and happy feeling from your heart all the time.\u00a0<br\/>10. After self-healing, try to do the same simple exercises you did before the attunement to help your physical body absorb Reiki energy better.<br\/>11. Keep on doing self healing for at least 21 days. It is best to do it every day even after you pass the 21-days period to maintain your health and improve your energy. Also, since the main benefit of channeling Reiki energy is to open and cleanse our heart, then it is always better to do Open Heart Prayer also every day to cleanse and keep our heart open better for Divine Love and Light.<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0<br\/>1) Suggested hand positions for channeling Reiki energy during Self Healing are (3 minutes per position sequentially):\u00a0<br\/>FRONT OF THE BODY: Forehead\/face, Cheeks, Throat, Upper chest, Lower chest, Stomach, Thighs, Knees, and Ankles<br\/>BACK OF THE BODY: Back of the head, Nape of the neck, Upper back, Lower back\/waist, Buttocks, Back of thighs, Calves and Soles of the feet\u00a0<br\/>2) More detail and complete techniques about doing healing and other Reiki techniques will be taught in Reiki Tummo workshops. Visit www.padmacahaya.com or www.padmacahaya.org for more information.<br\/>3) Please feel free to share your experiences after the attunement and doing Self Healing for 21 days and Open Heart Meditation every day.<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION<br\/>(By Irmansyah Effendi)<\/p> <p>Each time we have negative emotion, we leave \/ deposit negativities within our heart. How many time a day we have negative emotions, even though we do not show them. To cleanse the heart further (bigger and deeper), the best way is to ask for blessing from the True Source of Love and Light.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Before you start this prayer, you may need to write down the name of the people you don't like (you need to forgive), and for what you need to ask for forgiveness. You can replace the terminology \u201cTrue Source\u201d with any other terminology which you are more comfortable with \/ can relate better to.<\/p> <p>STEPS:<br\/>(Follow your feeling while praying)<br\/>1. Touch your heart (center of your chest) with 1 or 2 fingers<br\/>2. Close your eyes<br\/>3. Relax<br\/>4. Smile<br\/>5. Smile to your heart sweetly and freely<br\/>6. Feel the nice feeling from your heart, smile and stay within that nice feeling along the prayer<br\/>7. Pray (from the heart with feeling and love):\u00a0<br\/>1) True Source, please bless our heart so that all arrogance be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>2) True Source, please bless our heart so that all selfishness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>3) True Source, please bless our heart so that all anger be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>4) True Source, please bless our heart so that all envy and jealousy be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>5) True Source, please bless our heart so that all greediness and cunningness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>6) True Source, please bless our heart to understand that peace, calmness and joy are better than negative emotions. We have to let go of all negative emotions toward others, so that You can bless our heart, to fill our heart with Your Love and Light, peace, calmness and joy. Please bless and help us to be able to forgive everyone sincerely.<br\/>{Now, forgive everyone sincerely, although the same person has been doing the same negative things repeatedly and is still doing it. Remember that keeping negative emotion in you will simply give you pressure and burdens.}<br\/>7) True Source, as we have forgiven everyone else, please bless our heart so that all hatred, sadness, resentment, disappointment and other negative emotions, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>8) True Source, please bless and help us to realize that You are All Loving and All Forgiving. Please bless and help us to realize all of our mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.\u00a0<br\/>{Now, realize all of your mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.}<br\/>9) True Source, as You have forgiven all of our mistakes, please bless our heart and whole being so that all fear, worry, and burdens because of those mistakes, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>10) True Source, please bless and help us to be able to stay within our heart, within Your Love and Light, to always be peaceful, calm, and joyful.<br\/>11) True Source, thank You for all of Your blessing, Love and Light.<br\/>12) Amen.<\/p> <p>Note:<br\/>a. Since the most important benefit of Reiki attunement for our heart is to open and connecting our heart better to Divine Love and Light to cleanse our heart further, so for better results of Reiki attunement on your self and heart, it is suggested to do this Open Heart Prayer prior to receiving the attunement (say starting 2 weeks daily before the attunement) and every day after the attunement.\u00a0<br\/>b. The Open Heart Prayer CD in English or Indonesian language is available for purchase.\u00a0<br\/>c.

How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/230329473\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"xfbvslyvhbdb","time":1462230000000,"updated":1462288851000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"290 Harvard St","lon":-71.122505,"phone":"617 734-2501","name":"Coolidge Corner Theater","id":726945,"state":"MA","lat":42.342934,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.93505835533,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459985146000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The Coolidge Corner Theatre is proud to welcome back Berklee College of Music Professor Sheldon Mirowitz and the Berklee Silent Film Orchestra for\u00a0the world premiere of the Berklee Silent Film Orchestra\u2019s (BSFO) new, original score to E.A.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/230332313\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvhbdb","time":1462231800000,"updated":1462281235000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02115","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"NEC","address_2":"30 Gainsborough St","lon":-71.086495,"name":"Brown Hall","id":1445263,"state":"MA","lat":42.341397,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.53999602795,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460038627000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>***Please note the different location and time than usual***<\/p> <p>**NEC just moved this concert from Thursday 5\/5 to this date.**<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5014978\">Haydn: Symphony no 44 in E minor, H 1 no 44 \"Trauer\"<\/a><br\/>Allegro con brio<br\/>Menuetto &amp; trio: Allegretto<br\/>Adagio<br\/>Finale: Presto<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5014327\">Kod\u00e1ly: Dances of Gal\u00e1nta<\/a><br\/>Lento<br\/>Allegretto moderato<br\/>Allegro con moto, grazioso<br\/>Allegro<br\/>Allegro vivace<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5013993\">Mendelssohn: Hebrides Overture, in B minor Op. 26 \"Fingal's Cave\"<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zcogD-hHEYs\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zcogD-hHEYs<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantencore.com\/work\/work.aspx?work=5018579\">Beethoven: Symphony no 4 in B flat major, Op. 60<\/a><br\/>Adagio - Allegro vivace<br\/>Adagio<br\/>Allegro vivace<br\/>Allegro ma non troppo<\/p> <p>Date:\u00a0May 2, 2016 - 8:00PM<\/p> <p>Price:\u00a0Free<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0Brown Hall<\/p> <p>Price:\u00a0Free<\/p> <p><br\/>Location:\u00a0NEC's Brown Hall<\/p> <p>NEC's FREE concerts do not require a ticket, unless stated in concert listing.

You'll become part of an authentic learning culture under her expert stewardship, as we experience a discussion method called Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS). Rooted in research from cognitive psychology and arts education, VTS is currently used in business, healthcare, and education. What does VTS have to do with innovation in the workplace? To foster and sustain innovation, companies must cultivate growth mindsets, open communication and emergent leadership skills across team members. In other words, a healthy, productive workplace is one in which people are organized to learn and grow, not merely to execute. Visual Thinking Strategies models and teaches skills fundamental to teams that are structured to learn, break new ground, and achieve personal and organizational success.<\/p> <p>Studies on VTS show that it:<br\/>-Enhances skills in observation, critical thinking, and collaboration<br\/>-Increases the value team members and leaders place on communication, and<br\/>-Develops comfort with ambiguity, which is key to preventing premature decisions in the face of complex problems.<\/p> <p>Experience how developing visual thinking and facilitation skills can cultivate a healthy, productive discussion, within which everyone is accountable and focused, adaptable and creative, secure and open.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229763725\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"New Members Night in Medford","id":"229763725","time":1462312800000,"updated":1462550948000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02210","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"88 Sleeper Street","name":"Docks at the Barking Crab","lon":-71.04866,"id":12855022,"state":"MA","lat":42.353725,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.1748945713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459439473000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come paddle at one of our practice sessions\u00a0with Living Root, your 2015 Boston Dragon Boat Festival Grand Champions!

Unfortunately, lots of microservices anti-patterns and pitfalls emerge during this learning curve. Learning about these anti-patterns and pitfalls early on can help you avoid costly mistakes during your development process. While anti-patterns are things that seem like a good idea at the time and turn out bad, pitfalls are those practices that are never a good idea at the time - ever. In this talk Mark will cover some of the more common pitfalls and anti-patterns you might encounter while creating microservices, and most importantly describe some of the ways of avoiding these pitfalls and anti-patterns.<\/p> <p><b><i>Directions:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Address:\u00a0Pivotal Labs,\u00a0145 Broadway, Cambridge MA 02142<\/p> <p>It's at the corner of Broadway and Galileo Galilei Way.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

No exceptions.<\/p> <p><br\/>-No string bets or splashed pots.<\/p> <p>-Don't discuss hands as they are ongoing. Talking about hands or action is allowed only are when heads up, and only by the 2 players remaining in the pot.<\/p> <p>-Hands must remain on table or not more than 12 inches from the edge of the table and must be visible to all players.<\/p> <p>-Everyone makes mistakes but strive to pay attention so you act in turn in a timely fashion.

He studies exploration and its place within the cultural imagination. \u00a0 He also writes about the history of science and exploration on his blog \"Time To Eat the Dogs\".<\/p> <p><br\/>___________________________________________________<\/p> <p>The Social Hour begins at 7:00 p.m. in the hotel's (cash) bar and lounge above the second floor, and the PRESENTATION will begin at 8 p.m.<\/p> <p><br\/>Cost: to help defray the costs associated with room and equipment rental, the pith helmet will be passed around at the event for a requested $10 donation per person.<\/p> <p>Parking: $10 in the Hotel Garage<\/p> <p>For more info about the Explorers Club: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Explorers.org\">www.Explorers.org<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/9\/7\/600_449442391.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/culturevulturesBoston\/events\/230745156\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Race & Exploration Talk: \"Lost White Tribe--the Theory that changed the World\"","id":"230745156","time":1462316400000,"updated":1462331018000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1211836130000,"name":"Culture Vultures - Singles over 50","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1165987,"urlname":"culturevulturesBoston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Culture Vultures"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"9 Landsdowne Street","name":"Landsdowne Pub","lon":-71.097916,"id":10037982,"state":"MA","lat":42.361603,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.43273234367,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460568399000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We're inviting all single Boston\u00a0 professionals ages 25-45 to join us a for a casual after-work networking social and speedmeeting social.<\/p> <p>This gathering is for professionals who have completed or are currently pursuing an advanced or specialty degree i.e. Masters, MBA, PhD, Paralegal, JD, or other specialized certificate program.<\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$20 - PREPAY ONLY<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/advanceddegreeboston.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/advanceddegreeboston.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/advanceddegreeboston.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p>Schedule:<\/p> <p>7pm -\u00a0 Check in and mingle (Please try to check in by 7:30pm) Appetizers served from 7-7:30 or until gone.<\/p> <p>7pm-8:00pm - Icebreaker &amp; Mingle<\/p> <p>8:00-8:30pm - A select amount of 3 minute speed rounds with other guests of the opposite sex.<\/p> <p>8:30-9pm - More mingling<\/p> <p>How it works:<\/p> <p>-Arrive at the venue for socializing, cocktails and registration.

Who will take us on an illustrated journey with his recently released and thought-provoking book \"THE LOST WHITE TRIBE: EXPLORERS, SCIENTISTS, AND THE THEORY THAT CHANGED A CONTINENT\"<\/p> <p>In 1876, the famed explorer Henry Morton Stanley encountered Africans with what he was convinced were light complexions and European features. Stanley's discovery of this African \"white tribe\" seemed to substantiate the so-called Hamitic Hypothesis: the theory that the descendants of Ham, the son of Noah, had populated Africa and other remote places, proving that the source and spread of human races around the world could be traced to and explained by a Biblical story.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/2\/f\/600_449442799.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>In his book, Michael Robinson traces the rise and fall of the Hamitic Hypothesis. As Robinson shows, race theory stemming originally from the Bible not only guided exploration but archeology, literature, and also shaped the theories of Carl Jung who guided psychological and anthropological notions of the primitive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Hypothesis also formed the foundation for the European colonial system, which was premised on assumptions about racial hierarchy, at the top of which were the white races, the purest and oldest of them all. It was a small step from the Hypothesis to theories of Aryan superiority, which served as the basis of the race laws in Nazi Germany.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Based on painstaking archival research, The Lost White Tribe is a fascinating, immersive, and wide-ranging work of synthesis, revealing the roots of racial thinking and the legacies that continue to exert their influence to this day.<\/p> <p><br\/>Michael Robinson is a professor of history at Hillyer College, University of Hartford. He studies exploration and its place within the cultural imagination. He also writes about the history of science and exploration on his blog \"Time To Eat the Dogs\". ___________________________________________________<\/p> <p>The Social Hour begins at 7:00 p.m. in the hotel's (cash) bar and lounge above the second floor, and the PRESENTATION will begin at 8 p.m.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Cost: to help defray the costs associated with room and equipment rental, the pith helmet will be passed around at the event for a requested $10 donation per person.<\/p> <p>Parking: $10 in the Hotel Garage<\/p> <p>For more info about the Explorers Club: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Explorers.org\">www.Explorers.org<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/3\/7\/600_449442807.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Cultural-Nomads\/events\/230746443\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Race & Exploration Talk:\"Lost White Tribe--the Theory that changed the World\"","id":"230746443","time":1462316400000,"updated":1462329369000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334434371000,"name":"Boston Cultural Nomads","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":3669502,"urlname":"Boston-Cultural-Nomads","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Cultural Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02026","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Dedham","address_1":"25 Allied Dr,","address_2":"East St, Exit off Rte. 128","lon":-71.170684,"phone":"(781)329-7900","name":"DEDHAM HILTON HOTEL","id":881965,"state":"MA","lat":42.224676,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.6944160461,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426471921000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Networking and deal presentation\/bragging starts at 6:30 pm.

Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

At MIT Sloan, Aithan is pioneering workshops, courses, and developing emergent research where art and business meet in leadership development, creative renewal and talent retention, progressive prototyping and systems, culture, and behavior-shifting. He has designed programming for MIT Media Lab, the launch of MIT\u2019s Hacking Arts, Berklee Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship, is a participant at Summit Series and HATCH.

He is also critic\/lecturer at the Museum School of Fine Arts, and in his own studio, he draws, paints, and sculpts as an internationally-exhibiting artist.

Examples of these are provided using the open source ThreadFix plugin for the OWASP ZAP proxy and dynamic application security testing tool. These show opportunities attendees have to enhance their own penetration tests given access to source code.<\/p> <p>This presentation covers the \u201cABCs\u201d of source code assisted web application penetration testing: covering issues of attack surface enumeration, backdoor identification, and configuration issue discovery. Having access to the source lets an attacker enumerate all of the URLs and parameters an application exposes \u2013 essentially its attack surface. Knowing these allows pen testers greater application coverage during testing. In addition, access to source code can help to identify potential backdoors that have been intentionally added to the system. Comparing the results of blind spidering to a full attack surface model can identify items of interest such as hidden admin consoles or secret backdoor parameters. Finally, the presentation examines how access to source code can help identify configuration settings that may have an adverse impact on the security of the deployed application.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDan Cornell is a globally recognized application security expert, Dan Cornell holds over 15 years of experience architecting, developing and securing web-based software systems.

The presentation will be more \"good news\" that we have been \"Beggars At God's Banquet,\" unaware we are creators, and thus unaware of our incredible powers.<br\/>About Barry:<\/p> <p>Barry Harris majored in quantum physics in college, attended a \u201cNew Universe\u201d workshop taught by David Bohm (one of the most significant theoretical physicists of the 20th century), and Karl Pribram (who showed the brain as the decoder of holograms), and took a weeklong course with Karl Pribram\u2019s graduate student assistant.<\/p> <p>Barry also worked at the Hippocrates Institute in Boston, writing health booklets for Dr. Ann Wigmore, discoverer of wheatgrass and founder of the live food movement. Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill. While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries.<\/p> <p>Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics to Energy Medicine, cellular biology, neurophysiology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health, etc.<\/p> <p>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\" which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book \"Beggars At God's Banquet\" based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing in the spring.<\/p> <p>Barry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing\". His voice students learn the relationship of ego to breath patterns, and how to surrender control to a higher power. Barry is qualified to teach about miracles, because he had his own miracle. He restored his singing voice by recognizing the need for spiritual grace and surrender of control to a higher power, after Western doctors said he had damaged his voice beyond repair.<br\/>Barry can be reached at [masked], phone[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HOLISTIC-HEALTH-SPEAKER-SERIES-AND-STUDY-GROUP\/events\/230478087\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":7200000,"name":"Brain's Neuroplasticity and Miracles of Physical Healings with Barry Harris","id":"230478087","time":1462401000000,"updated":1462409923000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1260313056000,"name":"Holistic Health Speaker Series and Study Group","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":1567196,"urlname":"HOLISTIC-HEALTH-SPEAKER-SERIES-AND-STUDY-GROUP","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Concord","address_1":"152 Commonwealth Ave.","name":"Margot's Art Playground","lon":-71.396301,"id":24439217,"state":"MA","lat":42.458752,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.0271244049,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460655647000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will have a model, lightly clothed (underwear or bathing suit), on Wednesdays from 6:30 to 9:30.

All are welcome to join us, regardless of experience level!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have a game you are particularly interested in playing, you are welcome and encouraged to bring it. But this is not required; many people typically bring a selection of their favorites and we're always happy to teach. The only things you need to bring are an open mind and a good attitude. If you're particularly hot to try something out, you are encouraged to leave a comment and see if you can drum up some interest beforehand. Please bear in mind that table space is limited, so an especially huge or epic game may not be appropriate for the venue (but see our Sunday night event at Pandemonium in Central Square for an alternative venue).<\/p> <p><br\/>The event officially opens at 7 PM, but some people like to show up early; those who show up early should feel free to get started on a shorter warm-up game if time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/>We look forward to seeing you at the gaming table!<\/p> <p><br\/>WHERE WE SIT: Unless the restaurant is super-crowded, we gather in the basement dining area; just look for the games and say hi. We're friendly, honest!<\/p> <p><br\/>GETTING THERE:<\/p> <p><br\/>The Panera is located within easy walking distance of the Red Line T and several bus lines, and public transit is probably the easiest way of getting there. If you drive, mall parking is (theoretically) limited to 2 hours except where posted. I've never heard of anyone getting towed for overstaying this limit. For the extra-cautious, there are metered spots on Mass Ave; check the meter to be sure but most Cambridge meters don't need to be fed after 6 PM or 7 PM. There is also a Hubway bike-share station less than five minute's walk from the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>SOME NOTES:<\/p> <p><br\/>As a group, we don't usually make a huge deal about attendance policy, however: attendance at these events is limited, and our Panera events are usually not huge; one side effect of this is that RSVPing and then not showing up can have a disruptive effect on our events, and for particularly popular events, \"no shows\" take up a spot from someone who wanted to be there. Bottom line: If you RSVP for a Panera event, please make a good-faith effort to show up or at least let us know if you can't make it.<\/p> <p><br\/>As far as possible, please also let us know if you're going to be more than a few minutes late. As a rule of thumb, if we haven't heard from you and you arrive after 7:15 or so, you're likely to be limited to a spot at whatever game has room for an extra player. Much later than that, and we'll almost certainly be underway without you! You're welcome to show up and socialize and of course we'll try to accomodate you if we can, but we can't guarantee you a game. Because we as a group tend to play longer and more involved games, most groups at our events tend to play one and only one game per night.<\/p> <p><br\/>Panera has been quite gracious about hosting our group with minimal fuss.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/229683780\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":6300000,"name":"Thursday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"qvltskyvhbhb","time":1462464900000,"updated":1462472263000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Concord","address_1":"152 Commonwealth Ave.","name":"Margot's Art Playground","lon":-71.396301,"id":24439217,"state":"MA","lat":42.458752,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":18.0271244049,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460497964000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Drop in at the Art Playground anytime between 1 and 6 on Thursday afternoons for working with (or playing with, however you like to think of it) art materials in a friendly, setting.

If your hand is unintentionally mucked because you didn't protect it, there is no recourse, and the hand is dead. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>-Verbally declared actions are binding. Tapping the table is considered a check. An unintentional action will be forgiven only once\/night. Rules must be enforced fairly with all players, regardless of experience level. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>-No string bets or splashed pots.<\/p> <p>-Don't discuss hands as they are ongoing. Talking about hands or action is allowed only are when heads up, and only by the 2 players remaining in the pot.<\/p> <p>-Hands must remain on table or not more than 12 inches from the edge of the table and must be visible to all players.<\/p> <p>-Everyone makes mistakes but strive to pay attention so you act in turn in a timely fashion. If you have trouble knowing when it's your turn, let me know, and I'll help you with a reminder.<\/p> <p>-If you are in a hand or on the button (dealing), you are not allowed to be on your phone. -Host's decisions on rulings are final.<\/p> <p>-Once a player is done dealing, s\/he must move the button to the next dealer.<\/p> <p>-Cut-off shuffles, then passes the shuffled deck to the small blind to be ready for next deal.<\/p> <p>-Rule violations that influence the course of a hand will be dealt with as follows: First time=warning, Second time=dealt out for next hand. Third time=dealt out for a round. Again, everyone makes mistakes, but an awareness of the game is important.

Ave.<\/p> <p><br\/>Wasserstein Hall, Milstein East ABC<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>The Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School is pleased to announce plans for our 2016 annual conference, entitled: \u201cBig Data, Health Law, and Bioethics.\u201d \u00a0This year\u2019s conference is organized in collaboration with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and the Health Ethics and Policy Lab, University of Zurich.\u00a0<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Conference Description:\u00a0\u201cBig Data\u201d is a phrase that has been used pervasively by the media and the lay public in the last several years. While many definitions are possible, the common denominator seems to include the \u201cthree V\u2019s\u201d \u2013 Volume (vast amounts of data), Variety (significant heterogeneity in the type of data available in the set), and Velocity (speed at which a data scientist or user can access and analyze the data).<\/p> <p>Defined as such, health care has become one of the key emerging use cases for big data. For example, Fitbit and Apple\u2019s ResearchKit can provide researchers access to vast stores of biometric data on users from which to test hypotheses on nutrition, fitness, disease progression, treatment success, and the like. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have vast stores of billing data that can be mined to promote high value care and prevent fraud; the same is true of private health insurers. \u00a0And hospitals have attempted to reduce re-admission rates by targeting patients that predictive algorithms indicate are at highest risk based on analysis of available data collected from existing patient records.<\/p> <p>Underlying these and many other potential uses, however, are a series of legal and ethical challenges relating to, among other things, privacy, discrimination, intellectual property, tort, and informed consent, as well as research and clinical ethics.<\/p> <p>This conference, and anticipated edited volume, will aim to: (1) identify the various ways in which law and ethics intersect with the use of big data in health care and health research, particularly in the United States; (2) understand the way U.S. law (and potentially other legal systems) currently promotes or stands as an obstacle to these potential uses; (3) determine what might be learned from the legal and ethical treatment of uses of big data in other sectors and countries; and (4) examine potential solutions (industry best practices, common law, legislative, executive, domestic and international) for better use of big data in health care and health research in the U.S.\u00a0<\/p> <p>All panels will include time for audience Q &amp; A.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast\/events\/228190758\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Big Data, Health Law, and Bioethics (HLS Conference)","id":"228190758","time":1462536000000,"updated":1462548169000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164140077000,"name":"The Cambridge Moveable Feast","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":370532,"urlname":"Cambridge-Moveable-Feast","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Citizens of the World"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":21.1240844727,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458567837000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will focus on the basic Yoga asanas, \u00a0energetics of movement.<\/p> <p>This practice is good for beginners and designed for the students who enjoy taking things slow and mindfully.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDrop-in rate: 15 USD<\/p> <p>5 class pack: 60USD<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Acton-Sanctuary-for-movement-meditation-transformation\/events\/230635507\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"Yoga Light Flow","id":"cjhsrlyvhbjb","time":1462539600000,"updated":1462543999000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1433847220000,"name":"Acton Sanctuary for movement, meditation & transformation","group_lon":-71.4499969482,"id":18660144,"urlname":"Acton-Sanctuary-for-movement-meditation-transformation","group_lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Sanctuary Collective"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02135","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brighton ","address_1":"Beacon Street","name":"Chestnut Hill Reservoir","lon":-71.154106,"id":2829901,"state":"MA","lat":42.3339,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.66773271561,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461180402000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's meet up for a morning stroller walk around the Chestnut Hill Reservoir!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Because in the end\u2014I think, the nature of the mind will be understood in scientific terms that previous scientific explanations deemed impossible or\u2014indeed\u2014dualistic. \"Impossible,\" because the monism of mind-body science will be based upon an understanding of physical reality that permits an utterly dualistic appearance that could even encompass elements of parapsychology and non-locality (a term from quantum physics) in which the dualistic appearances are supported by a monistic substratum. So, indeed, both the monists and dualisits could then\u2014arguably\u2014be right. It might be a nice debate to argue which side is more right. But, really, the convergence of both sides will have made the argument largely moot.<\/p> <p>This discussion could appeal to both the Futurology and Mysticism study groups, and many others. I will attempt to develop some discussion points in which mysticism (and related paranormal topics), and the edges of theoretical science and technology may perhaps be converging. As I develop these points, I will update this introduction or post in the comment section at the bottom of the page.<\/p> <p>****************************************\u00a0 <b>ADMISSION FEE:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bronze and Gold Members are admitted free<\/b>.<\/p> <p><br\/><i>If you are not<\/i>\u00a0 a Bronze or Gold Member (paid members), there are two ways by which you may attend:<\/p> <p><br\/>1) Become a Bronze Member ($15 per year): you will find the payment link on the <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Philosophizers\/pages\/Membership_Levels\">Membership Page<\/a><\/b>.<\/p> <p>2) Message Arthur (Organizer) by clicking the message link on his <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Philosophizers\/members\/3026120\/\">PROFILE<\/a><\/b>.

It is often joked\u2014sometimes good-naturedly and sometimes sarcastically\u2014that mystics can be very verbose, writing lengthy books about what indescribable. Wittgenstein said that \u201cWhat cannot be spoken about must be consigned to silence.\u201d Is the post-singularity world a world that is claimed to beyond comprehension because machine intelligence will have taken over from human intelligence: an ineffable world that has similarities to mysticism?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 Everlasting life. Various spiritual traditions in different forms posit everlasting life after death. Ray Kurzweil argues that life can evade death indefinitely if not permanently. The dream (or some might contend, the nightmare) of everlasting life is a common thread that links mystics and singularitarians.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Faith. Faith in God (whatever that concept means to you) is a deep belief in a underlying intelligence that in terms of protection or redemption is something that we mere humans can depend upon and that, in some terms, justifies the very process of living. Singularitians have a faith in the ultimate superiority of machines over humans and their flaws, frailties and self-destructive nature. If we can't save ourselves, then our supercomputers and advancing technology will. Faith in God. Faith in machines. Not very Nietzschean, I must say. What about faith in ourselves?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Philosophizers\/events\/229893593\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Are Post-singularity Scientific Visions the New Mysticism?","id":"229893593","time":1462575600000,"updated":1462587976000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1304716937000,"name":"Social Philosophizers","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1826065,"urlname":"Social-Philosophizers","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Philosophizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01801","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Woburn","address_1":"6 Morningside Circle","name":"Mike Morse","lon":-71.172531,"id":6810932,"state":"MA","lat":42.461117,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.74545860291,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454421940000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Woburn-Drum-Circle\/events\/230246163\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Drum Circle","id":"zzdkslyvhbjb","time":1462575600000,"updated":1462588001000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334872643000,"name":"The Woburn Drum Circle","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":3703932,"urlname":"The-Woburn-Drum-Circle","group_lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Hand Drummers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01923","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Danvers","address_1":"152 Endicott Street","lon":-70.938461,"phone":"978-774-1897","name":"Denny's of Danvers","id":974062,"state":"MA","lat":42.547989,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.6474533081,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1380914570000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Admission FREE ($5.00 donation for non-Members to cover our tip) Coffee (or soft drinks) and snack (donut or dessert) Denny''s of Danvers LLC 152 Endicott Street, Danvers, MA[masked] 7-8:30 PM BEGINNING\/INTERMEDIATE Real Estate Investors Review Basic Selling.

Let's find out:<\/p> <p>Everything that happens once the signal leaves your mixer, how it affects your sound, and what you can do to sound your best in any situation, from the largest venues to the smallest basements.<\/p> <p>Baltimoroder was born out of necessity. The story begins in Illinois, where Baltimoroder (aka Erik Pearson) abused cheap Yamaha keytars and Fisher-Price turntables. In high school, punk shows, record stores and raw performance spaces filled his time. On to college, Los Angeles and the mighty KXLU radio station, where he absorbed avant-garde sounds, ambient music and experimental artists. The turning point came after a cross-country trek to Boston and a low-key house party. He took the decks, mixing tracks he had never heard into a swell that kick-started a dance floor. From that night on, the floor never stopped growing. DJing to dance fiends night after night is his passion\u2014whether thugged-out Baltimore music or the retro-sexual glam of Giorgio Moroder.

It\u2019s a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation\u2014a place where everyone gets to say the truth and feel heard. Through other people putting quality attention on you, and asking you questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening\u2014really listening\u2014to your responses, you have the opportunity to examine yourself. It\u2019s a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good, which allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>You can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you. You don't have to do anything you don't want to, or answer any questions you don't want to answer.

The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and morning of the 4th. The second quarter moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year, but it could still be a good show if you are patient. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>April 22, 23 - Lyrids Meteor Shower. The Lyrids is an average shower, usually producing about 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet C\/1861 G1 Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce bright dust trails that last for several seconds. Unfortunately this year the glare from the full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Lyra, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>May 6, 7 - Eta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower, capable of producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rate can reach about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet Halley, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The new moon will ensure dark skies this year for what could be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>July 28, 29 - Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Delta Aquarids is an average shower that can produce up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August 23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. The second quarter moon will block most of the fainter meteors this year but if you are patient you should still be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>August 12, 13 - Perseids Meteor Shower. The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe, producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will set shortly after midnight, leaving fairly dark skies for should be an excellent early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 7 - Draconids Meteor Shower. The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The first quarter moon will block the fainter meteors in the early evening. It will set shortly after midnight leaving darker skies for observing any lingering stragglers. Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 21, 22 - Orionids Meteor Shower. The Orionids is an average shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Halley, which has been known and observed since ancient times. The shower runs annually from October 2 to November 7. It peaks this year on the night of October 21 and the morning of October 22. The second quarter moon will block some of the fainter meteors this year, but the Orionids tend to be fairly bright so it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 4, 5 - Taurids Meteor Shower. The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks this year on the the night of November 4. The first quarter moon will set just after midnight leaving dark skies for viewing. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 17, 18 - Leonids Meteor Shower. The Leonids is an average shower, producing up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The waning gibbous moon will block many of the fainter meteors this year, but if you are patient you should be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>December 13, 14 - Geminids Meteor Shower. The Geminids is the king of the meteor showers. It is considered by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 multicolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1982. The shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The nearly full moon will block out many of the fainter meteors this year, but the Geminids are so bright and numerous that it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>Source(s):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EverydaySpacer-com2\/events\/225030462\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Next Meteor Shower","id":"225030462","time":1462594500000,"updated":1462607232000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369503037000,"name":"Everyday Spacer Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":8638442,"urlname":"EverydaySpacer-com2","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Everyday Spacers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","phone":"617-607-1981","address_1":"Mt.

We meet at the West Thompson Lake boat launch and be ready to paddle by 8 am. We paddle north up the lake and enter the river mouth. Since we will be working against the spring current it makes sense to go upstream until the arms start to fade or if the boats begin to bottom out, whichever comes first, then fish your distance back down the river, working sections. The river usually yields a few browns and rainbows if all the stars align and you work hard. Must be wearing a PFD and a have a whistle and a light accessible at all times. The rangers have a station on this Lake so I just abide and they leave me alone. Other things that make sense, a net, Dr Slick or needle nose pliers, brimmed hat, polarized eyeglasses, food + water. Light spinning gear works, feel free to use a flyrod. If its a total downpour I will have to cancel, light rain though, can make for a good day. This trip can be a lot of exercise if we have to deal with wind and chop on the lake and the river currents so keep that in mind.

Meetups are informal gatherings for educators who work with (or are interested in working with) Scratch. The meetups are organized into three parts:<\/p> <p>1. We start with networking over light refreshments, getting to know fellow attendees and sharing what people want to explore during the meetup.<\/p> <p>2. We collaboratively decide how to structure our learning and then form small groups based on our different interests. Maybe you want to have a discussion about classroom strategies or get more practice with Scratch\u2014or something else entirely. Feel free to move between groups if the session that you're in isn't working for you.<\/p> <p>3. We gather as a whole group for lunch and group sharing. You might pose a question to discuss with the group, or share something from your classroom. This is a great time to inspire and be inspired.<\/p> <p>Want to know more about meetups?

Every 3 minutes, one of the players will substitute, so that each player plays for 12 minutes at a time.<\/p> <p>The show will be free to watch, but I will request small donations from those who play.

The 3-hour timeslot includes setup and takedown, so try to be prompt. Lilypad supplies drums, PA, mixer, and amps. Let me know if I'm forgetting anything important in this description. Parking around Inman Square can be difficult! Be sure to schedule plenty of time for parking and walking.<\/p> <p>Remember, the goal is to play with minimal discussion. Listen; try something while listening; listen; try it again while listening; if it sounds good, repeat with variation.

After all bags have been thrown, a bag remaining on the board is worth 1 point. A bag that went in the hole is worth 3 points. Add up how many points you earned and compare them to your opponents. Equal points cancel each other out so that only one team can score per round. For example, if you scored 5 points and your opponent scored 3, you will add 2 points to your overall score and your team will throw first in the next round. If you scored 6 points and your opponent scored 6 as well, there will be no points awarded and whoever threw first in the last round will throw first again. A game is won when a team reaches 21 points with a lead of 2 or more points.

For brunch, consider the following :\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Gentlemen\/ish, here's your chance to steal the show! Go all out for \u00a0Brunch \u00a0and sport a seersucker or three-piece tweed suit. Top it off with a fedora or bowler hat and ground your look with loafers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ladies\/Ladylike,\u00a0A pantsuit, cocktail dress or business formal attire is recommended. Of course, you'll want to accessorize accordingly. Pearls, a \u00a0clutch and a stunning Derby hat are a must!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Hats\/Fascinators!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>From the fantastic to the sublime, there are no rules or limits when it comes to choosing your Derby hat.<\/p> <p><br\/>Wearing a hat to the Kentucky Derby is believed to bear good luck! The long-established fashion was started by the women, however, over the last few years, many men have taken part in the tradition as well. Wearing a hat is much like getting into costume, you might be pleasantly surprised to see what type of character you become.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Generally speaking, wide-brimmed, \"Southern Belle\" inspired Kentucky Derby hats. The hats can be decorated with flowers, feathers, bows and ribbons of any color to express creativity and individuality.A more recent trend in Kentucky Derby headwear is the fascinator. Smaller than a traditional hat and just as stylish, this piece of headwear has become more popular among Kentucky Derby attendees over recent years.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b> <b>Wardrobe (Ladies &amp; Gents)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0The event is an opportunity to showcase your finest spring look. Both female and male attendees pull out all of the stops when selecting their Kentucky Derby apparel.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to Derby dressing, \u00a0ladies typically wear spring dresses, pastel-colored suits, or bold separates that coordinate with their Derby headwear and accessories.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0The Kentucky Derby is a chance for every female to express her inner Southern Belle so take note and don't hold back when planning your Kentucky Derby wardrobe!<\/p> <p><br\/>When selecting your dress for the Kentucky Derby the recommended practice is to keep it simple, so it doesn't take away from your hat. You can also let the color and excitement of spring inspire you and select a dress full of color, or floral or equine patterns.<\/p> <p><br\/>Starting with the pants because it is the eye-catcher from a distance, gents should turn to sun drenched pants in vibrant colors like Key Lime, Ocean, Bermuda Pink, and Citron. Any one of these colors paired with the right shirt and blazer will make you stand out like no one else.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0Now that you have the pants you know that you're going to have some fun with the shirts. A great dress shirt in a complimentary color will go a long way. Don't be afraid to grab a fun gingham or striped shirt to turn it up. This is the one day of the year that more is better. One option that is a must for some is the monogram on the shirt!<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0The jacket is what brings everything together and you can't go wrong with the classic navy blazer. If you want to have a little fun on top though, a nice chalk stripe can really make the ladies' big hats turn. As far as 2- button or 3-button it's a person preference but we recommend sporting the 3- button side vent for a more polished look.<\/p> <p><br\/>Next is the tie. Most gentlemen wear a necktie, but a bow tie is always a great option. If you never wear bows, try it out and you may like it.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For shoes, there are many types of horse bit loafers out there and everyone has their idea of who makes the best ones. The most important thing you need to know is that they should be worn sockless.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0Top it all off with a fedora or bowler hat for the complete Kentucky Derby look. Men's Derby hats are generally solid in color and inspired by the style from the 1920s.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lesbians-of-Color-Symposium\/events\/230462400\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":12600000,"name":"Kentucky Derby Brunch","id":"230462400","time":1462642200000,"updated":1462655484000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1456979793000,"name":"Lesbians of Color Symposium","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19655507,"urlname":"Lesbians-of-Color-Symposium","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"50 Milk Street, 5th floor Meridian Conference Room","name":"CIC Boston","lon":0,"id":24498176,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461794762000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Are you curious about programming or thinking about pursuing a career in software engineering?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Then RSVP on this meet-up page for this 2-hour Intro to Coding class happening in the Boston area at CIC Boston.

But you probably won't. You'll likely start with the fact that Venice is built on water. It is a place where people either float slowly down palace-lined man-made waterways or stroll down narrow alleyways. There's no more extraordinary place to find yourself, or lose yourself. Be sure to stay in Venice before your next European cruise.<\/p> <p>Day 2 At Sea --- ---<\/p> <p>Day 3 Corfu, Greece<br\/>8:00 am 3:30 pm Corfu, Greece One of the lushest of the Greek Isles, Corfu is rimmed in dramatic blue waters and topped with tranquil hillside villages. A collection of quaint cafes in the town of Corfu feels very continental, but the island's secluded coves and sandy beaches could only be found in the Greek Isles. Explore more of Corfu on a European cruise!<\/p> <p>Day 4 Santorini, Greece<br\/>1:30 pm 10:00 pm Santorini, Greece Whitewashed villages clinging to the sides of the sea cliffs have made the volcanic island of Santorini one of the most widely photographed places in the world. The island's charm and subtle mystery have even made it a target of speculation as the location of the lost city of Atlantis.<\/p> <p>Day 5 Mykonos, Greece<br\/>8:00 am 6:00 pm Mykonos, Greece Mykonos is a classic Greek Island with whitewashed houses, blue-domed churches and windmills. Add a reputation for beautiful beaches and you'll understand why Mykonos is the most popular island in the Cyclades. Explore the island in a 4 x 4 or take a ferry to the tiny island of Delos. Explore more of Mykonos on a European cruise!<\/p> <p>Day 6 Olympia (Katakolon), Greece<br\/>9:00 am 6:00 pm Olympia (Katakolon), Greece This quaint little seaside town on the Ionian Sea is the gateway to Ancient Olympia, where Greek mythology was born and the first Olympiad was held. You may still be able to hear the distant echoes of the ancient Greeks cheering as you tour the ruins of one of the most important and exciting sanctuaries of antiquity.

But you probably won't. You'll likely start with the fact that Venice is built on water.

But you probably won't. You'll likely start with the fact that Venice is built on water. It is a place where people either float slowly down palace-lined man-made waterways or stroll down narrow alleyways. There's no more extraordinary place to find yourself, or lose yourself. Be sure to stay in Venice before your next European cruise.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Day 2 At Sea --- ---<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Day 3 Corfu, Greece\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>8:00 am 3:30 pm Corfu, Greece One of the lushest of the Greek Isles, Corfu is rimmed in dramatic blue waters and topped with tranquil hillside villages. A collection of quaint cafes in the town of Corfu feels very continental, but the island's secluded coves and sandy beaches could only be found in the Greek Isles. Explore more of Corfu on a European cruise!<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Day 4 Santorini, Greece\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>1:30 pm 10:00 pm Santorini, Greece Whitewashed villages clinging to the sides of the sea cliffs have made the volcanic island of Santorini one of the most widely photographed places in the world. The island's charm and subtle mystery have even made it a target of speculation as the location of the lost city of Atlantis.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Day 5 Mykonos, Greece\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>8:00 am 6:00 pm Mykonos, Greece Mykonos is a classic Greek Island with whitewashed houses, blue-domed churches and windmills. Add a reputation for beautiful beaches and you'll understand why Mykonos is the most popular island in the Cyclades. Explore the island in a 4 x 4 or take a ferry to the tiny island of Delos. Explore more of Mykonos on a European cruise!<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Day 6 Olympia (Katakolon), Greece\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>9:00 am 6:00 pm Olympia (Katakolon), Greece This quaint little seaside town on the Ionian Sea is the gateway to Ancient Olympia, where Greek mythology was born and the first Olympiad was held. You may still be able to hear the distant echoes of the ancient Greeks cheering as you tour the ruins of one of the most important and exciting sanctuaries of antiquity. Explore more of Katakolon on a European cruise!<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Day 7 At Sea --- ---\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Day 8 Venice, Italy (DISEMBARK)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>8:00 am ---<\/i><\/p> <p><b>NOTE:\u00a0Their are various offers and special NCL sales that will be offered at various times till the cruise takes place, ALL THOUGH WILL HAVE DEADLINES.

This is a fairly large complex of an old \"lunatic hospital\", one of many such institutions that we used to segregate mentally ill patients, only 50 years ago. Since it became politically incorrect in the 1970s, Massachusetts has shuttered many such (often very beautiful) buildings. This is one still standing and quite solidly so. All buildings are boarded up and we will NOT attempt to go inside any of these, but rather roam around the outside and try to capture the haunting character of this location.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please don't be late and meet us on-time at the GPS coordinates above, we will need to check in with the local police and move as one group. We will also leave at the same time, around three hours later (but you can leave earlier). This will be a popular event, please do not sign up unless you are sure that you can make it. Day-of-event cancellations will be marked as no-shows. Paid members only. <b>RAIN DATE: <\/b>Sunday, the day after.<\/p> <p>Suggested equipment: wide to super-wide angle lenses, as you will be rather close to the buildings and they are large. Dress appropriately for the weather and wear hiking books, it is uneven terrain.<\/p> <p><br\/>The sun sets at 7:35, we will have twilight left when we arrive to orient ourselves and this is a moonless night for added spook (ghosts, anyone?).

The Cambridge Community Center is just a few blocks from Central Square on the Red Line, and has limited street parking around it. We highly encourage public transit and carpooling -- feel free to start a carpool thread in the comments below! Parking is difficult. If at all possible we recommend that you take the T and walk to event. If you are coming from far away you should drive to Alewife and park in the garage there, take the redline to Central Square, and walk to the dance. If you need to park in central your best option is one of the five pay and display lots in the square.

Each participant would need to chip in $41.<\/p> <p><br\/>The session starts at 1330EST (1:30pm). It's about an hour of preparation plus 30 minutes in their wind tunnel. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes with laces - preferably sneakers. They must not be loose shoes, and don't wear loose jewelry, or they will fall off and become a hazard! Maximum weight is 250lbs. If you have ever had a shoulder separation or shoulder surgery, you will NOT be allowed to participate (for safety sake).<\/p> <p><br\/>If you don't want to go for the indoor skydiving, note that SkyVenture also has an awesome indoor surfing park, so if you want to learn surfing, you can also give that a shot while the others are in the wind tunnel.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll meet starting at 1200 (noon) at the plaza in front of 1 International Place, Boston, MA.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

How to Create an Event orientation is intended to walk\u00a0current -- and future -- PGN leaders through\u00a0the\u00a0mechanics of actually creating an offering on PGN.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If you are thinking about offering PGN members a social event, a practice group, or a workshop, take this workshop.<\/p> <p>(A separate orientation deals with the rationale,\u00a0philosophy, strategy, and practicalities of becoming a leader in the personal growth community.)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Topics<\/b><\/p> <p>- Timing\u00a0<br\/>- Creating a title<br\/>- Writing copy\u00a0<br\/>- Targeting<br\/>- Seeding\u00a0<br\/>- Communicating<br\/>- PGN style<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>A Bit About Leadership on PGN<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>PGN leaders are members of PGN who offer social, practice, or workshop events on PGN. \u00a0PGN leaders create over 200 events a year. \u00a0<\/p> <p>One of the main goals of the Personal Growth Network is to identify and support members who can create personal growth events for the community -- to help them become leaders.<\/p> <p>Any member of PGN may offer an event on PGN,\u00a0sharing their journey, their gifts, their joy, their successes, their vision, or their interests with like-hearted PGN members.\u00a0<\/p> <p>PGN offers such leaders a toolbox of software, of coaching, and of support to help\u00a0create successful events that benefit themselves and the membership.<\/p> <p>For\u00a0seasoned leaders, this is an important overview. \u00a0Newness can be a bit confusing initially. \u00a0(After all,\u00a0the \"growth\" is in our name is also for professional growth.) \u00a0Some\u00a0leaders, already with decades of experience, come to PGN with their own ideas about what has worked for them in the past and with definite ideas about what they expect PGN to do for them. \u00a0It benefits\u00a0seasoned\u00a0leaders to take a bit of time to grow into the new opportunities.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Potential leaders have less to unlearn. \u00a0Any member thinking about maybe creating an event to offer to the personal growth community can find PGN a very powerful and empowering vehicle. \u00a0You just need to learn how to utilize the the toolbox, the support, and the community.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About the Personal Growth Network<\/b><\/p> <p><i>A MetaOrganizer<\/i><br\/>The Personal Growth Network is a first-of-its-kind personal growth meta-organizer, bringing together diverse personal growth and positive psychology tools and techniques that are intended to help generally healthy people create greater joy and more success in all parts of their life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Via PGN, members can sample numerous approaches; they can select some approaches for more in-depth study; they can practice the approach sufficiently to impact their life in their desired direction; they can share their journey with other members, supporting one another; and, when they are complete with that phase of their growth, they can utilize PGN to find and explore a different approach or to refocus on a different part of their life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>A Community<\/i><br\/>PGN is also a community of like-hearted people who share an important, but not widely distributed, combination of values and characteristics (e.g., curiosity, willingness to learn, willingness to change habits, humility). These values not only help members to consciously and proactively craft a life well-lived, they are a way of experiencing the world, a way that is not widely shared in the general population.<\/p> <p>Engaging with other members of this community can be fascinating, supportive, and affirming for people who otherwise might believe that they are \"odd\" for having this important, extraordinary, and admirable combination of core values and characteristics.<\/p> <p>(To see if you share these characteristics,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/pages\/Is_Personal_Growth_Right_for_You%3F\/\">take our ten-question questionnaire<\/a>.)<\/p> <p><i>A Toolbox<\/i><br\/>And finally, PGN is a toolbox with which members can create events that support themselves and other members in the community. Members can create workshops, practice groups, and social events. Organizers might be trained, or they may have deep passion, or they may just want to share their journey, their gifts, their joys, their successes, their vision, or their interests.<\/p> <p>For these \"leaders\" in our community, PGN provides software, training, and support, and respectful access to the core people in the personal growth community who may be interested in joining them in their gifts.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Orientation Series<\/b><\/p> <p>Given the enormous ambition and power of the Personal Growth Network, and its rapid growth, it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed at first, so we offer some \"How-To\" guides to maximize your utilization of the Personal Growth Network for whatever your goals may be. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Our Orientations Include<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For Participants<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>-\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/230141117\/\">Thu Jun 16<\/a>:\u00a0Newbie Introduction\u00a0<br\/>. . .

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Laing quickly settles into high society life and meets the building's eccentric tenants: Charlotte (Sienna Miller), his upstairs neighbor and bohemian single mother; Wilder (Luke Evans), a charismatic documentarian who lives with his pregnant wife Helen (Elisabeth Moss); and Mr. Royal (Jeremy Irons), the enigmatic architect who designed the building. Life seems like paradise to the solitude-seeking Laing. But as power outages become more frequent and building flaws emerge, particularly on the lower floors, the regimented social strata begins to crumble and the building becomes a battlefield in a literal class war. High-Rise is the latest film by cult British director Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Sightseers, Down Terrace), adapted from the J.G. Ballard novel by screenwriter Amy Jump.<\/p> <p>HIGH-RISE opens Friday, May 13 at Landmark's Kendall Square Cinema.
