China, as the world\u2019s biggest exporter, and the United States, as the world\u2019s biggest importer, are two major trade players. However, due to language and geographical issues, there still has been a gap between U.S. and China\u2019s businessmen\/businesswomen in terms of information symmetry and efficiency of resource integration. <\/p>\n<p>We understand that the businessmen\/businesswomen in the U.S. are eager to find accessible sources of high quality products with lower cost, and at the same time, a number of giant manufacturers in China are looking for opportunities to expand their global sales networks and sell their products in a more cost-efficient way.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Our Mission:<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>We

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4. Meetings will be held in Manhattan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Sample articles<\/b><br>\n\n List of abbreviations:<br>\n\n NYT - New Your Times<br>\n\n WSJ \u2013 Wall Street Journal<br>\n\n FT \u2013 Financial Times<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 0.\u00a0The Truth About Our Libertarian Age By Mark Lilla -\u00a0newrepublic.com June 17, 2014<br>\n\n 1.

Our focus is to draw the male figure and depict masculinity in an open-minded, sex-positive nature&nbsp;not found in traditional drawing groups.

Poses are not an excuse to have sex with an unwilling partner. Don\u2019t assume. It\u2019s always okay to say no or stop. If you don\u2019t have CLEAR consent, don\u2019t get sexual. <\/p>\n<p>A little movement is okay, but come back to the same position and hold it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>PRIORITY RSVP AND \"NO-SHOW\" POLICY:<\/p>\n<p>To reward regular attendance and reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d, we have a priority RSVP system similar to airline priority seating.

It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with a little social time before and breaks during. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>BRING ALL YOUR OWN MATERIALS,&nbsp;drawing boards, portable easels, etc. Most guys draw on pads on their laps. There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>Bring a towel or sit on your shirt. Please be hygienic.<\/p>\n<p>Be mindful of your stuff (wallet, phone, etc). MNDGNY or the venues are not responsible for lost or stolen items.<\/p>\n<p>Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please put out some of your drawings so others can see them. If you\u2019re working in a notebook, show your drawings to the person taking photographs so he can take some snapshots. TAKE YOUR DRAWINGS HOME WITH YOU!<\/p>\n<p>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<\/p>\n<p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW; IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION? At regular sessions, there is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. From time to time, there will be special classes with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A NAKED EVENT BEFORE. WHAT'S IT LIKE?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. At studio venues, there are usually about 15-20 artists, at private homes about 10 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed after checking in and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, the poses can be sexual. <\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER POSED BEFORE. Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We'll help you out if you want, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. There is a sign-up sheet for poses with about 12-15 posing slots per session (varying lengths 5-20 minutes) so not everyone poses at each session. First-timers are not required to pose.&nbsp;Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IS THIS A GAY GROUP?&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexual so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT'S THE SEXUAL ENERGY OF THE GROUP LIKE?&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies depending on who shows up and is often higher at private homes but the focus is always on the art. This is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT IF I GET AN ERECTION?&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.<\/p>\n<p>WHO KEEPS THE DRAWINGS THAT I POSED FOR?&nbsp;Each artist keeps his own drawings. The model can ask for\/trade\/buy other artists' drawings.<\/p>\n<p>Organized by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shungaboy\">Shungaboy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our social media:<\/p>\n<p>Our Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.com...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MNDGNY\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/M...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Facebook Page:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mndgny\">https:\/\/www.facebook....<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Wordpress Blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.wordpre...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Updated 3\/12\/2016<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/highres_432143748.jpeg","photo_id":432143748,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/600_432143748.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/thumb_432143748.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":16687501,"name":"Shungaboy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/highres_212791212.jpeg","photo_id":212791212,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/member_212791212.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/thumb_212791212.jpeg"}},"members":359,"name":"Men's Naked Drawing Group NY","id":18232572,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mens-Naked-Drawing-Group-NY","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Naked Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1417727340000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"kali","name":"Kali","id":10041},{"urlkey":"mixed-martial-arts","name":"Mixed Martial Arts","id":15514},{"urlkey":"knife-fighting","name":"Knife Fighting","id":15570},{"urlkey":"japanese-martial-arts","name":"Japanese Martial Arts","id":18460},{"urlkey":"filipino-martial-arts","name":"Filipino Martial Arts","id":19466},{"urlkey":"combat","name":"Combat","id":21208},{"urlkey":"close-quarter-combat","name":"Close Quarter Combat","id":24042},{"urlkey":"stick-fighting","name":"Stick Fighting","id":24043},{"urlkey":"fencing-archery-and-medieval-martial-arts","name":"Fencing, Archery and Medieval Martial Arts","id":26753},{"urlkey":"internal-martial-arts","name":"Internal Martial Arts","id":28022},{"urlkey":"mma-mixed-martial-arts","name":"MMA Mixed Martial Arts","id":35023},{"urlkey":"chinese-martial-arts","name":"Chinese Martial Arts","id":38972},{"urlkey":"knife-defense","name":"Knife Defense","id":92715}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Martial-Arts-Dodgeball-Tennis-Paddle-Ball-VolleyBall\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>When the schedule says a start time it doesn't mean you have to be there at the specified start time. you can arrange to come at any point from start time to 8 pm.

This is accomplished through the following types of monthly events: - Writing Workshops: We bring in industry professionals for hands-on sessions where you can learn new techniques and skills to improve your work. - Feedback Opportunities and Pitching Practice: You will have many opportunities to present in front of your peers in order to gain exposure and gather feedback. - Networking Events: Meet other writers, actors, directors, producers, and other industry professionals to explore and form new collaborations. - Film Screenings: We curate films based on the group's interest to stimulate and facilitate group discussion and learning. - Guest Speaker Series: We invite active industry professionals who will share their experiences, insights, and advice.

Looking forward to getting the dogs together :)<\/p>","lon":-74.3199996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/highres_445753195.jpeg","photo_id":445753195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/600_445753195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/8\/b\/thumb_445753195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8637597,"name":"Sara Wilder","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/highres_5550704.jpeg","photo_id":5550704,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/member_5550704.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/f\/0\/thumb_5550704.jpeg"}},"members":98,"name":"Central NJ Small-dogs","id":18251496,"state":"NJ","urlname":"smalldog-centraljersey-meetup","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.4000015259,"who":"Small dog lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418524227000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"organic-foods","name":"Organic Foods","id":15485},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"wild-foods","name":"Wild Foods","id":22095},{"urlkey":"raw-and-living-food-potlucks","name":"Raw and Living Food Potlucks","id":41683},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"knowledge-sharing","name":"Knowledge Sharing","id":65780},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Food-and-Recipe-Sharing-Meetup-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>If you love food then this is the group for you.

From the point of view of spirit, \"nothing real can be threatened\" [A Course in Miracles]. From this perspective, it is madness to try to change anyone or anything; however, this conclusion hardly precludes action! Once freed from the need to change ourselves or others, we can devote all our thoughts to sharing our love and creativity, and there are an infinite variety of ways we can be kind and helpful to one another. In fact, it is only through sharing our inner creativity and unconditional love that we remember and realize our limitlessness.\n\nTo this end we envision hosting documentary film screenings, mixers, lectures, fundraisers, panel discussions, Q&As, and, perhaps later, organizing and\/or participating in various social good projects. We value diversity and inclusivity  and invite you to share your voice with the community.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1164150,"name":"Christopher Pelham","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/6\/5\/highres_1086757.jpeg","photo_id":1086757,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/6\/5\/member_1086757.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/6\/5\/thumb_1086757.jpeg"}},"members":274,"name":"Spirituality & Social Change Meetup","id":18263547,"state":"NY","urlname":"Spirituality-Social-Change-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Spiritual Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419034483000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"appreciate-and-enjoy-music-concerts","name":"Appreciate and Enjoy Music Concerts","id":23349},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548},{"urlkey":"laughter-fun-and-friendship","name":"Laughter Fun and Friendship.","id":89179}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EnjoyLife\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A community of people dedicated to enjoying life by any means necessary.

If you think that you have a twice exceptional child, but aren't sure, feel free to contact me.<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183083677,"name":"Melissa Sornik, LCSW","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/9\/8\/highres_242353464.jpeg","photo_id":242353464,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/9\/8\/member_242353464.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/9\/8\/thumb_242353464.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"Sea Cliff Parents of Gifted\/Twice Exceptional Kids Meetup","id":18268393,"state":"NY","urlname":"Sea-Cliff-Parents-of-Gifted-Twice-Exceptional-Kids-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Parents of 2e Kids"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419276113000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"new-jersey","name":"New Jersey","id":15569},{"urlkey":"brooklyn","name":"Brooklyn","id":16794},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"young-adults","name":"Young Adults","id":17649},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-and-40s","name":"Singles 30s and 40s","id":19134},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-20s-30s","name":"Singles 20's  & 30's","id":23012},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476},{"urlkey":"manhattan","name":"Manhattan","id":44868},{"urlkey":"jersey-city","name":"Jersey City","id":57300}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/datewalking\/","rating":4.62,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/9\/6\/600_436114198.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>Hello and welcome to Date Walking - The Easiest Way to Meet Someone Special.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>When you come to a Date Walking event, you will take a casual stroll with anywhere from 5 to 15 wo\/men over the course of an hour or two.

I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't.

Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI<br><\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice.<br><\/p>","lon":-74.4599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/c\/a\/highres_432913770.jpeg","photo_id":432913770,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/c\/a\/600_432913770.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/c\/a\/thumb_432913770.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you\u2019re genuinely interested in giving it a shot \u2013 stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and\/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group.

We understand that things come up and life interferes, but please do your best. ;)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*If you find that you can't make it to something you've signed up for -- CHANGE YOUR RSVP as soon as possible, or call\/text\/message an organizer\/event host if it is within 2 hours of the event.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive). We also limit our membership to men who are ADULTS - we will take men in their early 30's, but our IDEAL range is really mid-to-late-30's, 40's and 50's.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/highres_432994493.jpeg","photo_id":432994493,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/600_432994493.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/b\/d\/thumb_432994493.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3053297,"name":"Gil M.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/highres_1996121.jpeg","photo_id":1996121,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/member_1996121.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/f\/9\/thumb_1996121.jpeg"}},"members":67,"name":"NYC Gay Jewish Single Men 30's - 50's","id":18293308,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Gay-Jewish-Single-Men-30s-50s","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Jewish Gay Single Men"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Matawan","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420303616000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"boating","name":"Boating","id":8595},{"urlkey":"pwc","name":"Personal Watercraft","id":9784},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"jetski","name":"Jetski","id":14085},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"waverunner","name":"waverunner","id":20528},{"urlkey":"waterskiing","name":"Waterskiing","id":24058},{"urlkey":"discover-scuba-diving","name":"Discover Scuba Diving","id":65795},{"urlkey":"watersports","name":"Watersports","id":66479},{"urlkey":"jet-ski","name":"Jet Ski","id":93917},{"urlkey":"jet-skis","name":"Jet Skis","id":170789},{"urlkey":"jetskiing","name":"Jetskiing","id":1390482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJPWC-Jet-Ski-Club\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>Water Fanatics unite... <b>yes you!<\/b> We love jet skis and all the fun associated with them.

The awakening of vocal resonators and energizing the body will make you grounded in any job interview or business presentation.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>We may do a series of improvisational acting exercises geared towards getting you out of your comfort zone to create characters, stories and conflict within a scene on the spot. This gears you for being quick on your feet and thinking fast in the work place, and also gets people out of their comfort zone as they create these quirky and extroverted characters.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Other exercises will involve using all these acting tools in a business setting.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>For meet up members the price is $20 per class.

For most events we will charge a $1 maintenance fee, this is not to make money. &nbsp;The money goes toward the group and covers the monthly website fee. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2) ATTENDANCE: Most events will be first come first serve. If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

Other potential activities include theater, laser tag, stand-up comedy, trivia, dinners and cocktail hours, movie night, karaoke, etc. &nbsp; Most of our events are in Chelsea or mid-Manhattan Island.<\/p>\n<p>My original intention in starting this group was to make friends with people who like doing the same things I do. &nbsp;So far, it has worked out great, but to preserve the original integrity of the group, I ask that you follow a few ground rules: &nbsp;(1) You MUST include a photo of your real, actual human self. &nbsp;Unless you really ARE &nbsp;Darth Vader, a cute puppy, or the Manhattan skyline at sunset, please get a different picture. &nbsp;(2) Answer the membership questions. &nbsp; (3) &nbsp;Keep your RSVP status updated. &nbsp;<span>If you are one of those Meetup creepers that RSVP for everything and repeatedly flake at the last minute, you may be dropped from the group.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/0\/1\/highres_448301985.jpeg","photo_id":448301985,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/0\/1\/600_448301985.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/0\/1\/thumb_448301985.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":132094382,"name":"Janice","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/b\/c\/highres_243740412.jpeg","photo_id":243740412,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/b\/c\/member_243740412.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/b\/c\/thumb_243740412.jpeg"}},"members":599,"name":"Gay\/Lesbian Nerds in the City","id":18351477,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nerdy-and-Queer","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"GayNerds"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421643012000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"immigrationref","name":"Immigration Reform","id":10344},{"urlkey":"immigration","name":"Immigration","id":17427},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"visas","name":"Visas","id":125437},{"urlkey":"meet-people-on-working-visa-status","name":"Meet people on working visa status","id":378621}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Foreign-Entrepreneurs-Network-non-US-citizens\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Calling all Non-US citizen Entrepreneurs!

Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<\/p>\n<p>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from <br> these Luso-African countries.<\/p>\n<p>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England. Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<\/p>\n<p>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<\/p>\n<p>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<\/p>\n<p>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance.

I began marathon running in 2010 and consider running a bit of an obsession. After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs. The goal is to accommodate athletes who work abnormal hours and provide the valuable benefits of a running community for those with even the most demanding work schedule.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14630646,"name":"Steve N","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/highres_243261789.jpeg","photo_id":243261789,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/member_243261789.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/thumb_243261789.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"NY After-Hours Runner","id":18379811,"state":"NY","urlname":"After-Hours-Runner","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"After-hours Runners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422278895000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"knitting","name":"Knitting","id":212},{"urlkey":"community","name":"Community","id":15227},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"knitting-circle","name":"Knitting Circle","id":46642},{"urlkey":"charity-knitting","name":"Charity Knitting","id":99164},{"urlkey":"knitting-crocheting-for-charity","name":"Knitting  crocheting for charity","id":1110492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-hugs-nyc-org\/","rating":0,"description":"\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffKnitting Hats Donating Umbrella's, knitting gloves, and scarves.

The constant headlines of change and disruption is enough to leave anyone with more questions than answers.<\/p>\n<p>While its natural to internalize and apply ones thinking to his\/her own interests, experts agree that it's also important to understand a view that is larger than that which transcends our own interests. The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.

I'm Francesca - a 45 year old mom living in Maplewood. As a plus-sized woman, it's harder for me to find a network of like-minded women who come across the same challenges as I do in life... everything from shopping for clothes, to fitting in movie theater seats, to exercise. Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

Non-denominational and undogmatic, the worldwide Oneness Blessing phenomenon attracts  participants of all ages from all walks of life and beliefs (or non-beliefs) who bond over  a common desire for something more in life. \n\nThe blessing is a brief, light laying on of hands of subtle energies transmitted by Oneness Blessing Givers that initiate a neurophysical change in the brain, declutching the mind and quieting inner chatter and divisiveness. Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace. The experience is often sublime, and always tailored to exactly what it is that you need next in your life.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/highres_243811229.jpeg","photo_id":243811229,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/member_243811229.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/thumb_243811229.jpeg"}},"members":170,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423514461000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"lunch","name":"Lunch","id":19892},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"meet-for-lunches","name":"Meet for Lunches","id":28189},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Focused-Networking-Happy-Hours-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi all!

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/highres_66728792.jpeg","photo_id":66728792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/member_66728792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/thumb_66728792.jpeg"}},"members":217,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp;

This group has something for everyone who loves to craft with paper. Learn some tips and tricks from a Stampin' Up! Professional, while hanging out with new friends making cards, hand made gifts and more!! The possibilities are endless... I like to call these events \"Girl's Night Out\" because I want you to feel like you are pampered!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy teaching new techniques, stamping with my friends, and making various home decor items using rubber stamps, die cuts, and beautiful papers.  Join my monthly classes for inspiration, socialization, or to learn something new!  \n\nI have several ideas for upcoming meetups -- some will be classes where we will make several cards or a home decor item, and others will be an open house style where you can each bring your own paper crafting projects, and you can use all of my non-consumables such as punches, the Big Shot die cutting machine (and all the many dies I have), stamps, and ink.  I will provide great snacks (usually involves CHOCOLATE in one form or another) and drinks, and assist you with your creative projects.  Each class will be priced according to materials involved.\nI hope you will join me and I look forward to meeting some new friends who share this hobby!\n\nStampingly,\n\nSelene Ferguson","lon":-73.5899963379,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184446280,"name":"Selene Ferguson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/highres_244070559.jpeg","photo_id":244070559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/member_244070559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/thumb_244070559.jpeg"}},"members":46,"name":"South Shore Stampin Haven","id":18435309,"state":"NY","urlname":"South-Shore-Stampin-Haven","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Stampers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424008402000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"italiancar","name":"Italian Cars","id":4595},{"urlkey":"britishcars","name":"British Cars","id":10826},{"urlkey":"sports-cars","name":"Sports Cars","id":15179},{"urlkey":"car-enthusiasts","name":"Car Enthusiasts","id":16333},{"urlkey":"cars","name":"Cars","id":20578},{"urlkey":"custom-cars","name":"Custom Cars","id":20579},{"urlkey":"exotic-cars","name":"Exotic Cars","id":27721},{"urlkey":"european-cars","name":"European Cars","id":28352}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCExotics\/","rating":0,"description":"Where exotics ignite passion; passion to drive, passion for the streets; exhaust notes like a grand symphony in the busy streets of NYC!

Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other.

Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.

I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","members":138,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/highres_244267464.jpeg","photo_id":244267464,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/member_244267464.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/thumb_244267464.jpeg"}},"members":559,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils.

Here is what sets this group apart: <br><\/p>\n<p>1). We will typically have 1-3 meals per week. Some weeks will have more and some will have less. So far we have averaged around 2 per week. <br><\/p>\n<p>2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue. <br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity. I will cover all the meetup fees for now. If anyone wants to contribute feel free to but for now I am not going to ask.<\/p>\n<p> 4). A lot of groups seem to do the same activities or go to the same places over and over again. I will find new and exciting places to try that have good write ups and reviews. That being said, I am always open to member suggestions, so please send me suggestions of places you want to go. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you join the group and we can have a lot of fun exploring the amazing NYC food scene.

The current power structure will have you believe that all that exists is the physical world before your eyes. Yet, they use spiritual and other supernatural means to control and dominate the planet all the while conspiring to limit your potential as a divine being. They have subversively replaced our moral values given to us by our ancient ancestors with the worship of satanism, sex, money, materialism, militarism, power, racism, and sexism. They have further replaced true spiritualism with religious dogma and the belief in the five senses (physical existence) only. In fact, they are the chief architects of many of the planets conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Project Illuminated is a global effort to reveal the truth of our existence and show you how to create a new reality. One where you don't need to protest, amass a military like arsenal of weapons or get into wars to change the direction of the world. The powerful and free information as presented through this group will reveal the secrets of the universe that will help revolutionize our current thought process.

And by the final class, you will select a movie scene of your choice and direct that scene rehearsal in class to implement what you have learned.<\/p>\n<p>Directors Access&nbsp;Workshop&nbsp;is a fun and safe place to explore your craft of directing actors while expanding your director\u2019s tool box and skill set. When a scene is not working, directors often make a misdiagnosis of where the problem emanates. This workshop is a great opportunity to discover how to correct that common mistake by learning all six points of Jeremy\u2019s ACCESS method. During the workshop you\u2019ll learn to diagnose a performance problem accurately, so the correct method of adjustment can be implemented. This workshop is open to directors of all experience levels.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/6979d2_a82e5b4a78ea4a859a3c2dc73ba2d7c6.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_581,h_390,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01\/6979d2_a82e5b4a78ea4a859a3c2dc73ba2d7c6.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><span>Pictured above: Jeremy Wechter leading a Directors Access Workshop<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Director Rotation: Each workshop will have one movie scene &amp; two actors.

To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment. You are different every time you walk into the room; so is the group and so is your teacher. Therefore, each class holds completely unique possibilities. Class is located at the beautiful studios of Hamilton Health and Fitness (HHF), at 161 Erie Street (by Hamilton Park). HHF is a unique fitness center, offering integrated services for the body, mind and soul.
