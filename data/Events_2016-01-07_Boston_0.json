Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Somehow since then, in spite of living on a smallish income, she has managed to not only visit but live in most of the countries of the world including China, Russia, India, Egypt, North Africa, Europe, South Africa, South America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, North Pole, South Pole, etc.! She has circumnavigated the world many times and can say \u201cPlease, Thank You, and @##!!$%! In at least a dozen languages!<\/p> <p>She lived in Europe for the first time in the late 1980s, arriving in Germany to see the collapse of the Berlin Wall. A year in Tuscany followed, and also managed a year in Prague, Czech Republic, just in time to watch that country split into 2 separate countries. After returning to the US in 1995, a stint in graduate school followed. It wasn't until 2001, however, that a harried travel agent inadvertently launched her on her current obsession... Latin America. The travel agent had to get back to work, so told her to close her eyes, he would spin the globe and she had to agree to go wherever her finger landed. Fortunately, it was Peru, and after her first trip, it was love at first sight. She now spends 4 months every year (January-April) getting to know what really is her second home. Peru and Chile are her 2 favorites, as she has witnessed all kinds of fascinating political and cultural events over her decades of travel.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE DINNER<\/p> <p>Usually about 20 to 35 people composed of members and meetup invitees.<\/p> <p>Social Hour: 6:00 p.m. Dinner: 6:30 p.m. Speaker: Around 8 p.m. You can come at any time.<\/p> <p>RISTORANTE GRAN GUSTO<\/p> <p>We have negotiated two reduced (!) price dinners.

For example, what kind of person or group would initiate it?<\/p> <p>Kurzweil says the window for a gray goo attack will close in the 2020s, when strong AI will come to our defense, but then we must worry about the threat from strong AI. What do you think of this?<\/p> <p>The open-source software movement seeks to improve security through transparency. The idea is that if a system is exposed to all, then someone will detect and fix defects and security holes. And this seems to work. Do you think this sort of transparency would improve our defenses against runaway GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics), or do you think we would be better off with secrecy and strict regulation? Do you think it\u2019s possible that nanobots that are so small as to be \u201cundetectable\u201d could also be so capable that they could \u201cmonitor, influence and even control thoughts and actions\u201d? Before you say \u201cNo,\u201d recall earlier chapters, where Kurzweil showed how much computation can be done with very limited amounts of material, properly arranged.<\/p> <p>Do you think it\u2019s possible to relinquish certain aspects of technological progress, yet continue to make progress in other areas?<\/p> <p>What comfort or dread can we derive from our successes and failures in combating super-destructive computer viruses such as stuxnet?<\/p> <p>What do you think of Kurzweil\u2019s characterization of \u201cfundamentalist humanism,\u201d which he defines as \u201copposition to any change in what it means to be human (for example, changing our genes and taking other steps toward radical life extension)\u201d?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Philosophizers\/events\/225500782\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Futurology Study Group: Defending Against the Perils of the Singularity","id":"225500782","time":1449532800000,"updated":1449588306000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1304716937000,"name":"Social Philosophizers","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1826065,"urlname":"Social-Philosophizers","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Philosophizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.73765230179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435257950000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the monthly business meeting of SpeakOUT.<\/p> <p><br\/>All members are invited to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you want a copy of the agenda beforehand, contact [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SpeakOUT\/events\/226466696\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Monthly SpeakOUT Board Meeting","id":"ghlwhlytqbcb","time":1449532800000,"updated":1449541262000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391592871000,"name":"SpeakOUT","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":12729592,"urlname":"SpeakOUT","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Speakers & Other Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"763 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 7","name":"The Breathing Room","lon":-71.105568,"id":8576222,"state":"MA","lat":42.366524,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":1.87491583824,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435871761000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a weekly meeting where pregnant women and couples come to gain new insights about childbirth choices and issues that affect pregnancy and overall health. \u00a0Hear from birth experts ranging from midwives and doulas to registered nurses, educators and holistic healthcare practitioners.

Buckminster Fuller<\/p> <p>So, how do we inspire ourselves and each other into transformative change? And how do we change in ways that are creative and generative? This is where the power of story can act as an essential catalyst.

The compelling story lets us know we matter and why.<\/p> <p>By working in partnership with Nature, we can create an abundant, equitable and democratic future for the 21st Century, while healing and regenerating life on our precious home planet.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227150362\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytqbkb","time":1449534600000,"updated":1449589264000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Broadway","name":"Cambridge Innovation Center: 5th Floor, Havana Training Room","lon":-71.083199,"id":12752612,"state":"MA","lat":42.362732,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":0.701411783695,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433731210000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.80000019073},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bring your prototype, or just your game design sense!<\/p> <p>We'll meet in the Havana Room near the elevator on the 5th floor of the Cambridge Innovation Center.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Game-Makers-Guild\/events\/223093386\/","yes_rsvp_count":34,"duration":12600000,"name":"Playtest Meetup at CIC","id":"vnknhlytqbkb","time":1449534600000,"updated":1449585689000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294953487000,"name":"Game Makers Guild","group_lon":-71.0800018311,"id":1765339,"urlname":"Game-Makers-Guild","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Game Makers and Playtesters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":2.58282089233,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445080673000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will meet at 7:30pm, get settled and have a 30-minute sit; after a short break and discussion we will sit for another 30 minutes.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

You had to be a pretty technical person - the good news is that it has gotten easier to be secure in your online persona.<\/p> <p>These are some of the tools we will look at:<\/p> <p>1. Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging.<br\/>2. Email Encryption using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. There is also the GnuPG system here: <a href=\"https:\/\/emailselfdefense.fsf.org\/en\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/emailselfdefense.fsf.org\/en<\/a><br\/>3. Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity.<\/p> <p>There are also some great apps for secure texting and secure phones that provide end-to-end encryption for your calls, securing your conversations so that nobody can listen in. There is no way to be bulletproof, but knowing about the options available can provide a measure of security. It is ultimately up to you to decide how much security you want.<\/p> <p>Link to hangout: <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/hangouts\/_\/event\/cjfhrydio4rhi9bpgih1coop154?hl=en","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Business-and-Tech-Meetup\/events\/227105243\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":3600000,"name":"Virtual Meetup: Staying Safe - Overview of FREE Encryption Tools","id":"227105243","time":1449597600000,"updated":1449664407000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427807422000,"name":"Boston Business & Tech Industry Meetup","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":18527653,"urlname":"Boston-Business-and-Tech-Meetup","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Tech Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"1290 Tremont Street, next to RLTAC and Madison Park HS, Roxbury (02120)","name":"Whittier Street Health Clinic","lon":-71.098801,"id":24204967,"state":"MA","lat":42.331917,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.43975496292,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447295165000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Whittier Street Health Clinic\u00a0<br\/>1290 Tremont Street, next to RLTAC and Madison Park HS\u00a0<br\/>Roxbury, Boston, MA 02120\u00a0<br\/>Tuesday, 1:30 - 2:30 pm\u00a0<br\/>[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/7\/8\/600_442755992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Do you want to eat fresh produce?

about 5-8 different vegetables and 2-3 fruits, and you're often 'gifted' with extra items - 30 ounce jug of fresh hummus or lentil salad or chickpea salads, pound of garlic, large one-lb plastic container of ground pepper, or lots of other 'big items' we don't typically buy.]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Make us busy -

There are several reasons for this sometimes and unnecessarily contentious communication channel and relationship. The reasons range from stakeholders speaking different languages (some in code and some in colors and fonts), working in silos, ever-changing requirements not communicated properly from design to development or vice versa, and lacking transparency to design or development.<\/p> <p>Some of these issues can be solved by setting proper design and development workflow and standardizations. However there are some principles and tools that can also help solve most of the above outlined strife.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The principle of Atomic Design helps in breaking down the design into its modular and re-usable components. Pattern Lab is the tool that helps implement this principle. Through this principle and tool, we can promote better communication and transparency between the stakeholders. This presentation will demonstrate \"the full power of this battle station!!\" -- oops sorry, wrong quote -- \"the full power of Pattern Lab\".<\/p> <p>About presenter: <b>Kianosh Pourian<\/b> is an user interface developer\/UX and UI designer with 15+ years of experience in the web development industry.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28.

Having become a recognized success, you are exploring cooperative arrangements with others. Teaming agreements enable you to expand the scope of your customer offerings. However, nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) must be negotiated for the protection of your intellectual property (IP). Undoubtedly, your potential collaborator will wish to protect their IP as well. Further, you will need to reach agreement regarding who owns the arguably new and possibly jointly developed IP going forwards. NDAs can preclude you from competing in entire markets, can disqualify key members of your technical team from participating in other opportunities and can even lead to antitrust charges. Our panel will identify key issues with NDAs that you need to be aware of.<\/p> <p>Teaming agreements are the next step in building cooperative arrangements. But will they enhance your business opportunities or will they unintentionally restrict your ability to grow your own brand or expand your product line? These issues are a significant concern when you are working with a larger business partner.<\/p> <p>One form of teaming is to engage a distributor. Will the distribution contract that you sign guarantee that the distributor will promote your product? Is the territory or vertical market assigned to your products appropriate, particularly in exclusive arrangements? A key issue is who is responsible to the customer if the product fails to perform and how is a defect remedied.<\/p> <p>As you can see there are many business issues that can distract you from focusing on your start-up. Being aware of these issues allows you to guide your company's team carefully and efficiently through negotiations with the greatest possible success. Our panel of seasoned legal councilors and CEO will present advice based on their experiences. Join us to listen to and talk with our panelists and to network with fellow entrepreneurs who share your interests in rapid business expansion.<\/p> <p>Panel:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/2\/8\/600_444495400.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>George Hillman, Seldon Technologies, Inc.<\/b><\/p> <p>George Hillman has over 30 years of experience in the financial community with approximately 22 years focused in the life science field.

Generosity\u2014as understood by the ancient masters\u2014extends well beyond the idea of material giving: It refers to a state of mind and heart that is open and magnanimous. Generosity is a state of being that does not cling to anything: not to things, to thoughts, to ideas, to opinions, to respect, to reputation or to outcomes. To go deep with generosity is to let go of grasping at its root, to enter the true spirit of shunyata, spacious reality. This is why Gampopa, in his masterwork The Jewel Ornament of Liberation, explained that generosity can be practiced as a form of material giving all the way up to the ultimate freedom of enlightenment itself.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please join us for a session of natural meditation in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.

Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

no limits!\"<\/b><\/p> <p>Thanks to the efficiency and BI (business intelligence) of Fair Foods of Dorchester (FairFoods.org), founded about 35 years ago by self-reported vegetarian Nancy Jamison, we have way more than AMPLE food for any intended audiences, and the operation is bettered if MORE people take the food than if FEWER take the food.<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is NO QUALIFICATION (no test of need) and no limit to how much you can cart off (just pay $2\/bag and $1\/loaf of bread).\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's why I post it on a\u00a0meetup\u00a0like this (not merely on a volunteer meetup).<\/p> <p>There are tens of thousands of college students who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>There are tens of thousands (myriads) of homemakers and working individuals who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>Lots and lots of seniors AND needy folks, and there's no operational shame in prudent fiscal management if you know that you can get quality produce at a far lower price.<\/p> <p>[The snag is that, unlike in grocery stores - or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items -

Its meaning extends beyond the literal idea of draftsmanship. Disegno is the principle or method which underlies sculpture, as well as fine art painting and architecture. Above all,\u00a0disegno\u00a0constitutes the intellectual component of the visual arts, which justifies their elevation from craft to fine art, on a par with literature and music.\u00a0<br\/>In like manner, in the programming\/software development community, a Design Pattern is a phrase used to describe a langue Franca of software construction whose principles underlies software development. Some associate this idea only with OO but does it equally well apply to FP? \u00a0Is Design just the intellectual component of the programming arts and design patterns just a lingua franca of design independent of programming language paradigm?<\/p> <p><br\/><i>(speech level: Intermediate; duration: 20 minutes)\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Data at rest... Data in Motion<\/b>\u00a0[Craig Lubin]\u00a0<br\/>Lambda Architecture is a design pattern for building scalable and fault-tolerant data processing systems. Nathan Marz designed this generic architecture addressing common requirements for big data based on his experience working on distributed data processing systems at Twitter. This general purpose approach decomposes the problem of data analysis into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer.

We will cover the nuanced complexities of real-world environments, from dual-writer inconsistencies to eventual consistency to cache re-indexing. \u00a0You will leave with both a logical and technological view of how to architect a production-grade stack platform that leverages Riak KV as a scalable, distributed database, and integrates these toolsets in a way that runs smoothly from prototype to production.\u00a0We will use the example of a product-catalogue that begins with an RDBMS backend and grows in complexity as business requirements require them to do so. By the end of the session, you will learn about system architectures, the databases involved and how to weave together the technologies necessary for today's complex applications. \u00a0<\/p> <p><i>(speech level: Intermediate; duration: 40 minutes)\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Happy-Data-Hour-Boston\/events\/227279615\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":12600000,"name":"Happy Data Hour + NoSQL Night #3","id":"227279615","time":1449700200000,"updated":1449713760000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427861560000,"name":"Happy Data Hour Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18528749,"urlname":"Happy-Data-Hour-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","city":"Boston","phone":"617-247-1212","address_1":"655 Boylston Street","name":"Charlesmark Lounge","lon":-71.078569,"id":995309,"state":"MA","lat":42.350043,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.81712859869,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445965735000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's ring in the holidays with Cocktails, Conversation, and Good Cheer at The Charlesmark Lounge in Boston!

In order to release code into production every minute of every day, the code base must always be releasable. Hardening sprints are gone. This sets a new bar for automation coverage at every level and requires a new approach to non-functional testing. It can also eliminate the need for separate testing environments. It is OK for some aspects of testing to occur in production.<\/p> <p>This brave new world is not for everyone. However, it has arrived in some organizations and many others are trying to get there.\u00a0 We will examine the implications of Continuous Delivery on both development and testing and see why it demands that everyone must be able to say \u201cI am a tester\u201d.<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b><\/p> <p>David Grabel is an agile coach at Vistaprint bringing Agile beyond engineering for Lean UX, Marketing, and Creative. He has introduced Scrum, Kanban, XP, and SAFe at both small and large organizations. As a consultant, his clients have included Vistaprint, Trizetto, Bose, and PayPal where he helped them adopt agile at the team and enterprise level. He is certified as CSM, CSP &amp; SPC.<\/p> <p>He was President of Agile New England, a non-profit group dedicated to accelerating the adoption of agile throughout the New England region, from 2013-2015.

Its meaning extends beyond the literal idea of draftsmanship. Disegno is the principle or method which underlies sculpture, as well as fine art painting and architecture. Above all, disegno constitutes the intellectual component of the visual arts, which justifies their elevation from craft to fine art, on a par with literature and music.\u00a0<br\/>In like manner, in the programming\/software development community, a Design Pattern is a phrase used to describe a langue Franca of software construction whose principles underlies software development. Some associate this idea only with OO but does it equally well apply to FP? \u00a0Is Design just the intellectual component of the programming arts and design patterns just a lingua franca of design independent of programming language paradigm?\u00a0<br\/><i>(speech level: Intermediate; duration: 20 minutes)\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0<br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Data at rest... Data in Motion<\/b>\u00a0[Craig Lubin]\u00a0<br\/>Lambda Architecture is a design pattern for building scalable and fault-tolerant data processing systems. Nathan Marz designed this generic architecture addressing common requirements for big data based on his experience working on distributed data processing systems at Twitter. This general purpose approach decomposes the problem of data analysis into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer. This allows for arbitrary queries and computations for both near real-time data as well as historical data.<br\/><i>(speech level: intermediate; duration: 20 -25 minutes)\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Riak KV and the Basho Data Platform\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0[Alexander Sicular\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/siculars\">@siculars<\/a>]<br\/>In this session, we will walk through the technology landscapes involved in utilizing Riak and its integrated components \u00a0- from caching with Redis, search with Solr and analytics with Spark. We will cover the nuanced complexities of real-world environments, from dual-writer inconsistencies to eventual consistency to cache re-indexing. \u00a0You will leave with both a logical and technological view of how to architect a production-grade stack platform that leverages Riak KV as a scalable, distributed database, and integrates these toolsets in a way that runs smoothly from prototype to production.\u00a0We will use the example of a product-catalogue that begins with an RDBMS backend and grows in complexity as business requirements require them to do so. By the end of the session, you will learn about system architectures, the databases involved and how to weave together the technologies necessary for today's complex applications. \u00a0<br\/><i>(speech level: Intermediate; duration: 40 minutes) <\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/new-england-engineers\/events\/225179642\/","yes_rsvp_count":51,"name":"NoSQL Night #3","id":"225179642","time":1449703800000,"updated":1449756451000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425017940000,"name":"New England Software Engineers","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":18464567,"urlname":"new-england-engineers","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Sharp minds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Beverly","address_1":"314 Cabot St","name":"Papa Gino's","lon":-70.878685,"id":23890921,"lat":42.552982,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":16.5534744263,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440628533000,"fee":{"amount":0.5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Map below:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/b\/6\/600_438484022.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>PLEASE SIGN-UP SO OTHER PEOPLE WILL KNOW OTHERS WILL BE ATTENDING.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Official<\/i><\/b> time reset to 6:30 pm, \u00a0of course, there is nothing to change people coming earlier at around 6:00\u00a0as usual.<\/p> <p><br\/>We have had\u00a06 to\u00a08 people lately for each Cribbage night, but having more people is always better.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the cards.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/salemsocialcards\/events\/226587040\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Cribbage Meetup Wednesday @ Papa Gino's Beverly","id":"pdwgklytqbmb","time":1449703800000,"updated":1449715330000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326050741000,"name":"Salem Social Cards","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3068172,"urlname":"salemsocialcards","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"40 Granite St","name":"Morse School","lon":-71.112297,"id":23874416,"state":"MA","lat":42.35569,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.18454289436,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433256350000,"fee":{"amount":8,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join the Red Velvet Steppers weekly instructional class.

Sean won the 2013 Ice House Comedy Club Talent Showcase in Pasadena, CA and soon after became a paid regular. In 2014, Sean was selected to perform in the 1st ever San Diego Comedy Festival in San Diego, CA. In February 2014, Sean was the highest rated and viewed comedian on LAFFEST.com and won their first ever Los Angeles showcase at the Hollywood Improv. In March of 2014, Sean taped a set for Comedy Time TV on Hulu.com. In April and May of 2014, Sean embarked on the successful Great Plains Party Tour where he traveled the Midwest performing 11 sold out shows! In June of 2014, Sean was a featured comedian on Ora TV\u2019s recently cancelled online show, Headline Punchline. Sean also hosts and produces a bi-weekly show named #FreeParking at the Garage in Culver City, CA. Sean is currently starring in, producing, and writing for an online series titled 'Brick &amp; Sizzle' - a buddy cop comedy that follows two LAPD police officers who moonlight as fashion models. This past spring, Sean competed on America's Got Talent! In September 2015, Sean was named an 'UP RISER' fresh face comedian to watch by Stand Up Magazine. Eric Hahn is a stand-up comic and writer based out of Los Angeles. In 2009 Eric was fired from his long standing manager job at a restaurant chain (whose initials are CPK) when he first started performing comedy for joking about said company (aforementioned CPK) on stage. The silver lining to being canned (his first time ever being fired for anything) was a headlong dive into stand up comedy, acting and writing. Eric hates pizzas, pastas, salads and attorneys who start restaurants.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in Boston?<\/p> <p>At TurnON, we play three communication games, and you can participate at whatever level feels good to you. Imagine meeting new people in an environment where they feel comfortable to be themselves; a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>TurnON events give you the opportunity to look deeper into yourself, through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses. What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to be authentic. It's like a giant exhale when the rest of the world is asking you to hold it in. In just an hour, you may even forget that you are in Boston.<\/p> <p>TurnON Boston is an organization that teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and information on where to learn more. The games we play at TurnON events are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without actually doing the practice (or touching anyone, or removing any clothing!).<\/p> <p>$10, payable at the door.<\/p> <p>Limited non-resident parking is available alongside our building on Dudley Street, or plentiful metered spaces on Mass Ave are only one block away (and free after 6pm).

A dazzling examination of a marriage, it is also a portrait of creative partnership written by one of the best writers of her generation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Every story has two sides. Every relationship has two perspectives. And sometimes, it turns out, the key to a great marriage is not its truths but its secrets. At the core of this rich, expansive, layered novel, Lauren Groff presents the story of one such marriage over the course of twenty-four years.<\/p> <p>At age twenty-two, Lotto and Mathilde are tall, glamorous, madly in love, and destined for greatness. A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed. With stunning revelations and multiple threads, and in prose that is vibrantly alive and original, Groff delivers a deeply satisfying novel about love, art, creativity, and power that is unlike anything that has come before it. Profound, surprising, propulsive, and emotionally riveting, it stirs both the mind and the heart.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Easy access by T, near the Orange and Green Line stops at Back Bay, Arlington, and Copley","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Sh-t-I-forgot-to-read-the-Book-Club\/events\/226872042\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Fates and Furies, by Lauren Groff","id":"226872042","time":1449793800000,"updated":1449841928000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377225158000,"name":"The *Sh*&%t, I forgot to read the Book * Club","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":9931052,"urlname":"The-Sh-t-I-forgot-to-read-the-Book-Club","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"270 Tremont Street Boston, MA 02116","name":"Citi Performing Arts Center","lon":-71.064972,"id":13223832,"state":"MA","lat":42.350513,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.705395281315,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445567153000,"fee":{"amount":88,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Check out the show here - I've seen it already and its really excellent!!\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.citicenter.org\/buy\/show-listing\/once\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.citicenter.org\/buy\/show-listing\/once<\/a><\/p> <p><i>Winner of eight 2012 Tony Awards including BEST MUSICAL, ONCE is a truly original Broadway experience.

He has been an experienced CEO for over 18 years driving unprecedented growth and market share expansion. Since 2003 he was President and CEO of PHT Corporation, a leading provider of innovative technology systems used to collect patient-drive eData for clinical research. Phil grew PHT dramatically from 60 people to over 460 people taking the company from under $5MM in sales and annual losses to well over $100MM in sales and significant profitability. Earlier this year, Phil successfully sold the company to ERT Corporation providing a very successful exit for his venture investors. Prior to this, he was also a leading executive at eXcelon Corporation, Clinsoft, BBN Technologies, Interleaf Inc. and Oracle Corporation.<\/p> <p>Philip is a strategic thinker and focuses on operational excellence and flawless execution. He is a leader that seeks to hire the best people in the industry and enable them to thrive by fostering an environment where they can grow and flourish. Philip\u2019s willingness to mentor and work directly with employees is one of the reasons why his companies have been so incredibly successful.<\/p> <p>In both 2012 and 2013, he was a Finalist in the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award, a recognition for outstanding entrepreneurs who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in areas such as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. That same year he was named a finalist for Mass TLC\u2019s CEO of the year, Mass High Tech and the Boston Business Journal Tech Luminary of the year, and in 2011, named one of the top 100 Most Inspirational People in Life Sciences.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/6\/4\/600_444370084.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Asian-Professionals\/events\/226932448\/","yes_rsvp_count":50,"duration":5400000,"name":"How To Think And Act Like A CEO To Propel Your Career Forward","id":"226932448","time":1449793800000,"updated":1449800898000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1171747225000,"name":"The Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":431528,"urlname":"Boston-Asian-Professionals","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Boston Asian Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Waltham","address_1":"240 Moody St","name":"Garcia Brogan's - Waltham","lon":-71.236771,"id":23896231,"lat":42.371986,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.57138633728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449169465000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We haven't seen each other in a while, so I would love to catch up!<\/p> <p>Let's eat, drink, and be merry at Garcia Brogans!<\/p> <p>It's a bit quieter until about 10. \u00a0Then, usually, the music and dancing starts.<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>-Kaitlin<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Ask the hostess - she will know where we are sitting","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Unicorns-Analytics-Fun-and-Fitness\/events\/227191048\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":8100000,"name":"Eat, Drink, and Be Merry","id":"227191048","time":1449794700000,"updated":1449804468000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442004287000,"name":"Unicorns - Analytics, Fun, and Fitness","group_lon":-71.2600021362,"id":18922183,"urlname":"Unicorns-Analytics-Fun-and-Fitness","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Unicorns"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"561 Windsor Place","name":"Bay State Fencers","lon":-71.092857,"id":24043101,"state":"MA","lat":42.375305,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.578130126,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441209197000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Ongoing class in Medieval and Renaissance Longsword in the tradition of Johannes Lichtenauer.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Longsword is the iconic fantasy Knight's sword - a two-handed, straight blade with a cross guard.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The experience is not so much like watching a movie, as like \u2026 well, spying on your neighbors. \u201cHitchcock traps us right from the first \u2026 And because Hitchcock makes us accomplices in Stewart\u2019s voyeurism, we\u2019re along for the ride\u201d (Roger\u00a0Ebert).<\/p> <p>Rear Window\u00a0will be screened on 35mm\u00a0film<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDoes not get better than a Hitchcock Double Feature with discussion after.

In The Other Paris, Luc Sante gives us a panoramic view of that second metropolis, which has nearly vanished but whose traces are in the bricks and stones of the contemporary city, in the culture of France itself, and, by extension, throughout the world. Drawing on testimony from a great range of witnesses\u2014from Balzac and Hugo to assorted boulevardiers, rabble-rousers, and tramps\u2014Sante, whose thorough research is matched only by the vividness of his narration, takes the reader on a whirlwind tour. Richly illustrated with more than three hundred images, The Other Paris scuttles through the knotted streets of pre-Haussmann Paris, through the improvised accommodations of the original bohemians, through the whorehouses and dance halls and hobo shelters of the old city.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A lively survey of labor conditions, prostitution, drinking, crime, and popular entertainment, and of the reporters, r\u00e9aliste singers, pamphleteers, and poets who chronicled their evolution, The Other Paris is a book meant to upend the story of the French capital, to reclaim the city from the bons vivants and the speculators, and to hold a light to the works and lives of those expunged from its center by the forces of profit.<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book - Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

I think that they do, but I'm not sure why. Perhaps my uncertainty exemplifies the topic because the answer may be that mysticism\u00a0 may be important for some people but not for others.<\/p> <p>****************************************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>ADMISSION FEE<\/b>:\u00a0 <b>Gold Members<\/b> are admitted free.\u00a0 All other members are required to pay a $5.50 admission fee, which is due on or before Dec. 1st.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arthurdschwartz.com\/social-philosophizers\/eventadmission5.50.htm\"> <b>PLEASE PAY HERE<\/b><\/a>.\u00a0 Any unpaid registrations as of Dec. 2nd will be changed to \"not attending.\" After Dec. 2nd, please pay before registering your RSVP.<\/p> <p>*****************************************\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>There are many forms of mysticism: rich traditions that crisscross philosophy, spirituality and religion. I would say that the basic essence of mysticism is a belief and\u2014more than belief, a\u00a0 feeling or profound sense of awe that the whole universe is interconnected by One or a unity that many would call God, others a transcendent Mind, and others a universal consciousness in which all conscious beings participate. Also, in mysticism it is often claimed that states of reverie are achieved and said to be states of enlightenment. And, thus, here we have the basic theme for this discussion. From the point of view of philosophy, do mystical traditions and their meditative and ritual practices promote or help us discover wisdom and understanding? And does this understanding go beyond, or at least facilitate, valuable perspectives that philosophical thinking\u2014or reason in general\u2014have difficulty resolving or explaining.<\/p> <p>As I mentioned, I think mysticism is important and valuable but my reasons are not clear in terms of specific principles or concrete examples. But, then, I don't think that mysticism is really intended to provide these things. Mysticism, in my view, is a collection of inspirational and creative metaphors that generate insight for the likes of scientists, philosophers and artists in any media. 'Metaphor' is probably not a good word for what I am trying to express, because while metaphor is certainly involved in mysticism, it does not do justice to the experiential profundity that is claimed, or the creativity that it clearly inspires.<\/p> <p>There are many mystical traditions; here are a some of the major ones:\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kundalini_yoga\">Kundalini yoga<\/a>;\u00a0 Hindu and Buddhist <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tantra\">Tantra<\/a>;\u00a0 arguably <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zen\">Zen<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taoism\">Taoism<\/a>;\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kabbalah\">Kabbalah<\/a>;\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sufism\">Sufism<\/a>;\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gnosticism\">Gnosticism<\/a>;\u00a0 Madam Blavatsky and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theosophy\">Theosophy<\/a>,\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Gurdjieff\">Gurdjieff<\/a> and his student <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/P._D._Ouspensky\">Ouspensky<\/a>.\u00a0 There are, I am sure, many other mystical orientations and traditions.<\/p> <p>I hope that some of you will come to this meeting and share your mystical practices, traditions and perspectives or, on the other hand, discuss why you may feel that mysticism is not rational or, perhaps, even dangerous as a form of non-rational, anti-rational or irrational thinking. And I would welcome hearing from members who have particular experience and\/or knowledge of mysticism and of particular mystical traditions. Or, again, I would welcome hearing from those who reject mysticism, or are perhaps excited about the potential of science to supplant it.<\/p> <p><br\/>I cannot help thinking that there is a real convergence occurring in the modern age between science and mysticism. There is a very interesting anthology by Ken Wilber, <i>Quantum Questions: Mystical Writings of the World's Great Physicists<\/i> that includes writings of the great theoretical physicists of the twentieth century for e.g. Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Max Planck. Almost all of them espoused mystical beliefs about the nature of the universe. In discussing the topic of the\u00a0 technological\u00a0 singularity\u00a0 in the Futurology study group we have seen, I think, a convergence in which machine intelligence appears to be morphing into an organic, universal intelligence. This theme also occurs in recent movies such as <i>Her<\/i> and <i>Lucy, <\/i>which\u00a0 conclude with human and\/or machine intelligence merging into a collective consciousness that might be compared to what\u00a0 some imagine as the mind of God.<\/p> <p>During this dinner discussion, we will ponder the question of whether or not mysticism may be one of the solutions to the problems of humanity's present and future or, on the contrary,\u00a0 a type of thinking that needs to be overcome.<\/p> <p><br\/>GOLD MEMBERS ARE ADMITTED FREE.\u00a0 ALL OTHER MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A $5.50 REGISTRATION FEE, WHICH IS DUE ON OR BEFORE DEC. 1st.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arthurdschwartz.com\/social-philosophizers\/eventadmission5.50.htm\"> <b>PLEASE PAY HERE<\/b><\/a>.\u00a0 ANY UNPAID REGISTRATIONS AS OF DEC. 2nd WILL BE CHANGED TO \"NOT ATTENDING.\"\u00a0 After Dec. 2nd, please pay before registering your RSVP.<\/p> <p><br\/>********************************<\/p> <p>The restaurant is directly across the street from the Kendal MBTA station.<\/p> <p><br\/>Your admission fee does not include the cost of food and drink.

Really, its going to be the sound healing event of the season! If you only go to one sound healing a year, make it this one! Sarah is incredibly intuitive and knows how to work with the sound to allow you to have a transformative experience.<\/p> <p>What do I mean when I say hearing the heart? No, not your heart beat ... but soul beat would be more accurate. Hehe. But anyway, I am clairaudient so I use this healing power to tune into your heart chakra and entrain it back to vibrate at its resonant frequency. I know that might raise an eyebrow but come and experience it and you'll feel what I mean ;)<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?<\/p> <p>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be answering the wake-up call to the divine presence ... And trust me, if you come, you will hear it ringing ; ) Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket\/blindfold) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Donations accepted and please bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!<\/p> <p><br\/>Much love,<\/p> <p><br\/>Brian<\/p> <p>[masked])<\/p> <p>Contact: [masked]<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Directly across the street from Wakefield Convenience Store","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soul-Experiments\/events\/227180200\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"duration":4500000,"name":"Hearing the Heart Sound Healing with Brian and Sarah","id":"227180200","time":1449880200000,"updated":1449961200000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1316996187000,"name":"Soul Experiments","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":2542822,"urlname":"Soul-Experiments","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02458","country":"us","city":"Newton","address_1":"295 California Street","name":"American Legion Post 440","lon":-71.200775,"id":5917092,"state":"MA","lat":42.365017,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.699198246,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1375723748000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/5\/9\/600_444713337.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>The Boston Minstrels Holiday Party <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Please come to our gathering on: Friday, December 11, 2015<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanlegionpost440.org\/\">Post 440, The Charles Room<\/a><\/p> <p>295 California Street, Newton, 7:30 PM<\/p> <p><br\/>The Blues Dogs are our featured band, dancing galore!!!\u00a0Live singing and delightful dancing\u00a0Pot Luck, please bring a finger licking good app or dessert\u00a0$10 at the door covers the hall fee.\u00a0Please bring a friend to show off your favorite\u00a0community music group!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tim McHale - Executive Director<br\/><b><i>The Boston Minstrels<\/i><\/b><br\/><b>Making Music with Heart<\/b><br\/>102 Litchfield Street<br\/>Boston MA 02135<br\/>[masked]<br\/>Email -\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><br\/>Website -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonminstrel.org\/help.htm\">www.bostonminstrel.org<\/a><br\/>Donate -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonminstrel.org\/help.htm\">www.bostonminstrel.org\/help.htm<\/a><br\/>Schedule\u00a0-\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonminstrel.org\/sched.htm\">www.bostonminstrel.org\/sched.htm<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The Charles Room at the American Legion Post 440, Newton, MA","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Boston-Minstrels-Company\/events\/226448407\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Monthly Rehearsal\/Holiday Party","id":"qjxlmgytqbpb","time":1449880200000,"updated":1449891841000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1330435890000,"name":"The Boston Minstrels","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":3381222,"urlname":"The-Boston-Minstrels-Company","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01752","country":"us","city":"Marlborough","address_1":"162 Cook Lane","name":"Breathe Wellness","lon":-71.531174,"id":1637413,"state":"MA","lat":42.346836,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.6132736206,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447765833000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/e\/0\/600_444464768.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>THIS MONTH \u2013 Psychometry (Reading objects)<\/p> <p>Do you wish you could still talk to a loved one you\u2019ve lost?

A five mile route, and a 10 mile route. Both routes begin with runners taking Fairfield Street to the esplanade and then heading east along the river to the Science Museum, before crossing over into Cambridge. Runners then have the option of looping through Lechmere Canal Park (doing so adds about 1\/3 mile) before heading west along the Cambridge side of the Charles. For the shorter route, runners will return to Boston over the Mass. Ave bridge and then cross the Fairfield Street footbridge and take Fairfield back to the start. For the longer route, runners will continue on the Cambridge side to the River Street Bridge before crossing back over. Those looking to run the full 10 will continue to the Arlington Street footbridge and then do a partial loop of the Public Garden (see the map). Anyone looking to do 8 can easily cut the longer run by taking the Fairfield footbridge back to the start. 5 mile route: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gmap-pedometer.com\/?r=6763575\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gmap-pedometer.com\/?r=6763575<\/a><br\/>8\/10 mile route: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gmap-pedometer.com\/?r=6763583\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gmap-pedometer.com\/?r=6763583<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dashing-whippets-boston\/events\/226614560\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Whippets Weekend Run","id":"pmfbmlytqbqb","time":1449925200000,"updated":1449937109000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446688625000,"name":"Dashing Whippets Running Team - Boston Chapter","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19091782,"urlname":"dashing-whippets-boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Boston Dashing Whippets"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02368","country":"us","city":"Randolph","address_1":"43 Scanlon Dr.","address_2":"Exit 5A, RTe. 28 off Rte. 128","lon":-71.062899,"phone":"781- 961-4660 ","name":"THE LANTANA","id":896011,"state":"MA","lat":42.201097,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.0076370239,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448328463000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>*Super Sat.-Financial Education and Business Forum*<\/p> <p>Financial independence is not a dream.

To fully understand why we are hosting this charity, you must first understand her story:<\/p> <p>\n\nFrom her sister, Sofia Hart:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"Olivia always thrived to do the best she could. Being gifted with horse back riding as our hobby (or life passion) growing up, she was incredibly fearless and passionate with everything in her. She was also happy to be a Vineyarder during her years playing Hockey and Soccer, representing the place she loved most, home. Her determination was unstoppable on and off horse back, the field, and the ice. These characteristics followed her through her life growing into adulthood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nAs a recent University of Vermont graduate, she did just the same in her studies. When she felt defeated, she would do everything in her power to figure out what went wrong, and how she could fix her mistakes. While at her graduation, tears of joy were brought to my eyes as she smiled receiving her achievements and laughed and hugged with friends. Not only was she proud of herself, but she was even more proud of the people who surrounded her and their accomplishments too.<\/p> <p>\n\nThese qualities and characteristics went even further into the workplace. As a former employee of the Homeport Resturant, she used the skills and experience she learned there and carried it to the Seafood Shanty. Each and every job she has held has meant so much to her. Good days and bad days, she always would talk so highly of her job, especially for how dedicated she was to each establishment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThrough hardwork, fearlessness, dedication and most importantly, love, Olivia has gained a rather admirable reputation growing up on Martha's Vineyard for 22 years, and at UVM during her college years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThese amazing qualities and characteristics have not diminished one bit during these tough times. Her spirit is incredibly high, and she shocks us on a daily basis how positive her attitude is. I can not imagine being in her place, and handling the news she gets on a daily basis. Although she has received bad news many times, her positive outlook has not changed. Olivia is determined as ever, looking toward the brightest future.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nHere is more on Olivias condition, with a post from her Facebook page:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"So here it is. On the 9th I was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and diagnosed with a condition known as cardiomyopathy which is a disease of the heart muscle. There is damage to both the right and left portions but the majority of the damage is in the left ventricle. It wasn't until I had a cardiac MRI that the doctors realized my condition was most likely irreversible. The doctors believe it either began years ago when I most likely contracted a viral infection that attacked my heart or may have been something I was born with... the overall cause is unknown. My age enabled me to live and thrive with the condition until a couple of months ago. Currently, I am in the process of being placed on the heart transplant list, which I will hopefully be accepted to by the end of the week, and will receive a new heart by the start of the new year. For now that is about all that we know.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Important Information:<\/p> <p>\n\nWhen - October 31st, 11:00am<\/p> <p>\n\nWhat to bring - This will be a costume workout, so please wear an AWESOME halloween costume.

Peace is an active\u00a0consciousness that we can learn to enter into,\u00a0enriching our individual lives, our social situations and the world at large.\u00a0<\/p> <p>During this evening, we will practice discovering the peace that is always present within us -- no matter what else is going on inside us or outside us in the world. \u00a0 As we practice recognizing our inner core of peace, we become increasingly able to choose to live in that consciousness of inner peace, even at difficult times of our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will look at where we unconsciously practice \"against-ness\", and learn to let go of that feeling of against-ness, to better work with reality and with the people who surround us.

As Winter Reimagined has become increasing popular,\u00a0we request our visitors to plan extra time for admission and parking. During evening hours, when visitation is highest, we encourage carpooling when possible. We also recommend that\u00a0VISITORS FRESS WARM and WEAR STURDY SHOES \/BOOTS for \u00a0outdoor walks around the gardens. To expedite entry at the gate, we encourage non-member visitors to bring exact change for admission (although we do accept major credit cards).\u00a0<\/p> <p>After strolling through the glowing gardens, visitors are welcome to explore the indoor facilities.<\/p> <p>LIVE MUSIC SCHEDULE: The Tedescho Duo will be performing @ 6:00 -8:0 pm<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/c\/8\/600_443830440.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>***\u00a0PLEASE NOTE: Accessibility during Winter Reimagined<br\/>Tower Hill\u2019s\u00a0INTERIOR\u00a0 spaces\u00a0are accessible on foot and by wheelchair.\u00a0These interior spaces include the Garden Shop, Twigs Caf\u00e9, the Library, the Milton Gallery and the Conservatories.

Think \"light at the end of the tunnel\" or \"explosion of the Christmas lights\". This is also educational, because it will give you more experience figuring out the exposure range.

The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comingsoon.net\/films.php?id=53397\">In the Heart of the Sea<\/a> reveals the encounter\u2019s harrowing aftermath, as the ship\u2019s surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-movie-group\/events\/218940913\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"In the Heart of the Sea  (7:30 IMAX 3D Show)","id":"218940913","time":1449963000000,"updated":1450024185000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1140735210000,"name":"Boston Movie Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":225256,"urlname":"boston-movie-group","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Movie Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02109","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"340 Faneuil Hall Marketplace","name":"The Hideout","lon":-71.054047,"id":12265062,"state":"MA","lat":42.360298,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.816166579723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448315580000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Co-posted with New England Flash Mobbers.<\/p> <p>WOW!

There won't be any awkward \"I hope I'm chosen before the kid in the full body cast\". The \"rules\" will be explained by the referee before playing starts. They aren't complex, and there won't be any instant replays for controversial calls.<\/p> <p>It's designed to be fun, playful, and casual. The only rule I can remember is not aiming for someone's head. Ladies, I can't guarantee that the guys are going to follow that one : ) Guys, this is still not the best way to get a woman's attention\u2026.<\/p> <p>All levels are welcome!

I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not the purpose of this event. The purpose of this event is to create an opportunity for us to get to know each other. The presence of something like a fursuit may make someone, who is new to the group, uncomfortable. Furry artwork, illustrated clothing, convention badges, ears, tails and even collars will be allowed. After all, it will help someone new find our group! ^.^ If anyone feels uncomfortable because the rest of our are \"showing too much furry pride,\" please bring the matter up with me, first.<\/p> <p>Note: It is not essential, but I\u2019m encouraging each and every one of us to tip. This will ensure that we maintain a good relationship with the staff. The minimum wage for \u201ctipped services\u201d is about half that of other forms of employment. Therefore, most waitstaff rely heavily on tips, as their source of income. An average tip would be between 15% and 20% of the total cost of your meal.

Guests will be given numbers as they arrive, and they select and unwrap gifts from the pile in that order \u2014 with a twist....<\/p> <p>The person who receives the number 1 will pick a gift (that is not their own) from the pile and open it for all to see (or models it, reads it, or demos it). During the selection of a wrapped gift, the participant may visually inspect the gifts, pick them up and\/or gently shake them.<\/p> <p>The person who receives number 2 then chooses a gift and opens it, and then must decide whether to keep it or swap it for the first player\u2019s gift.<\/p> <p>Each person in order then gets to select a present, open it and decide whether to keep it or swap it for any other gift someone has already opened. Opening of gifts and swapping takes place until all the presents have been chosen. Finally, the person who picked first gets to choose from all the gifts or keep what he\/she has already received. In the end, the gift you are holding is the gift you take home.<\/p> <p><b>TIPS ON WINNING A YANKEE SWAP<\/b><\/p> <p>Always buy something that you want \u2013 there is a good chance that you could end up with your own gift\u2026shop accordingly. Make sure what you purchase for the Yankee Swap is something that you wouldn\u2019t mind walking out of there with.<\/p> <p>Be shrewd \u2013 If you see a gift that you want\u2026take it. I don\u2019t care if you are taking a gift away from your grandmother that she absolutely loves\u2026take it.

Calzada (of breakfast tamale pop-up fame) explains that the Aztecs would sacrifice people as a gift to the corn gods, in hopes of better corn crops. Because corn was so important to the Aztec belief system, dishes featuring corn, like pozole, took on a ritual significance. These days, pozole is eaten all over Mexico, especially on September 26th, the day of Mexican Independence. Estela's signature pozole features corn ( large hominy kernals ) pork, chile ancho, chile guajillo, garlic and onion, and topped off with shredded lettuce, radishes, oregano and lime\u2014to suit your individual taste. to accompany our Pozole,Estela will teach students how to make a delicious Ponche; a traditional fruit punch served during Christmas time to warm you up when the grasp of winter is at it's strongest.

Cars -- filled with children young and old -- marvel at the incredible sights as they wait in line to see magnificent displays of dazzling lights.<\/p> <p>\u00a0The story of Rockvale Road\u2019s amazing Christmas lights began for Mike Dascoli fifteen years ago when he started decorating his home for the holidays.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u201cI started out small with my decorations but, after my Dad passed on, I started to expand the display.\u00a0 Christmas was his favorite holiday.\u00a0 It brings me great enjoyment to do it because, while I\u2019m putting up the lights, I think about him.\u00a0 I think he would love these lights.\u00a0 So, I guess it really is in honor of him that I do it,\u201d explained Dascoli.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Most of the neighbors enjoy decorating for Christmas, too, and, like Dascoli, they just laugh about the added traffic and say to each other that it\u2019s only for the month of December, so they can live with it.<\/p> <p>\u00a0You can enter the wondrous world of holiday lights if you go to Rockvale Road from about 4:30 in the afternoon until 9:30 p.m. or until 10:00 p.m. on the weekends.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dascoli says, \u201cOn Christmas Eve we keep them on until 12:00 a.m. for the people who want to stop by on the way to Midnight Mass.\u00a0 We turn our lights on every year on the Friday after Thanksgiving and leave them on until New Years Eve \u2013 weather permitting.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u201cI put all the lights on and the displays up by myself except for the big trees.\u00a0 Chuck\u2019s Tree Service comes here every Thanksgiving morning with his bucket truck and we decorate the trees,\u201d adds Dascoli.<\/p> <p>Dascoli\u2019s wide variety -- of more than 100,000 lights and countless displays -- includes a family of Snowmen, Mickey Mouse &amp; friends, Santa Claus, huge blow-up figures and much, much more.<\/p> <p>Several years ago, Dascoli started collecting donations at his house to benefit local organizations.\u00a0 Over the years he has donated the money collected in a wishing well at the end of his driveway to the Tewksbury Senior Center, the Tewksbury Recreation, and the Tewksbury Community Pantry.<\/p> <p>In keeping with the theme of his extravagantly decorated house, Dascoli\u2019s wishing well has beautiful lights and an illuminated teddy bear with a sign that reads, \u201cWe hope our display of lights brings a smile to your face and joy to your hearts\u2026\u00a0 This year\u2019s wishing well proceeds will be given to the Tewksbury Community Pantry.\u00a0 Over the years, Dascoli estimates that he\u2019s collected more than $10,000 for charity.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, last year a thief tried to steal the joy of Christmas by knocking over the wishing well and absconding with about $200.\u00a0 Well, everyone knows you can\u2019t steal the spirit of Christmas so one of Santa Claus\u2019s helpers, Kraft Power in Woburn, stopped by to help the Dascoli family continue to collect donations for the charity of their choice. Kraft Power donated the use of a generator for the lights and replaced the wishing well with a larger, sturdy one.<\/p> <p>Dascoli starts stringing more than 100,000 lights the day after Halloween and his wife, Pattie, estimates the cost to light their Christmas display from November to January at about a $1,000 a year.<\/p> <p>Over the years, Dascoli has been dubbed as \u201cone of the good guys\u201d by many residents of Tewksbury.\u00a0 He keeps adding to his display as well as replacing figures that get tattered and worn. He does it for his family \u2013 his wife, Pattie, twin boys, Kevin and Keith, daughter, Deanna and youngest son, Michael. Michael serves in the Marine Corp and has just finished boot camp. He will come home from Parris Island this week.\u00a0 But the newest addition to the Dascoli family this year is grandson, Justin Keough who is just 10 months old.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis year is really special because I\u2019m doing it for Justin so he can enjoy the lights,\u201d says Dascoli, with great pride.<\/p> <p>And so, Dascoli\u2019s labor of love (to light up his little corner of the world) continues -- to the incredible delight of all who travel down Rockvale Road during Christmas time!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com\/homenewshere.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/eb\/ceb71a00-2282-11e1-88ed-001871e3ce6c\/4ee23724b1a22.image.jpg?resize=300%2C201\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com\/homenewshere.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/eb\/ceb71a00-2282-11e1-88ed-001871e3ce6c\/4ee23724b1a22.image.jpg?resize=300%2C201<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/227290783\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Pre Football hangout w\/Amazing Xmas Display at our home in Tewksbury","id":"227290783","time":1450036800000,"updated":1450066628000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"Aberdeen Ave & Huron Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138","name":"Aberdeen Ave & Huron Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138","lon":-71.147324,"id":14915262,"state":"Ma","lat":42.378754,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.16296482086,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449353922000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The oldest, established, permanent floating Community Walk in Cambridge and environs.<\/p> <p>Please join the Fresh Pond Community walkers + five other meetup groups for this delightful sunset walk.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let's join 20+ walkers and some other walking groups for:<\/p> <p>Over 3 years of reliable walking<\/p> <p>\n\nPlease note that this walk does not start at the same place as the other Fresh Pond walk.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe'll go out to dinner at a local pub or chinese restaurant - you can get a decent dinner for under $10.<\/p> <p>Frequently, if we eat too much food, we'll go for another walk.<\/p> <p>Come see why this walk is so popular.

It's another excuse to cook and to get together with you all (a good enough reason for me)!<\/p> <p>So here we are in the height of the holiday season. Dare I squeeze in another event?! Yep, I'm going for it.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please join me for a Food Swap of Holiday Cookies!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you love to make cookies or love to eat them . . . then this event is for you.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The concept is simple: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>1. Pick a single recipe. Yep, just one. It could be a personal favorite, Grandma's secret recipe, or one that you've bookmarked on Pinterest.<\/p> <p><br\/>2. Next, make a <b>minimum of 3 dozen cookies<\/b> with your chosen recipe. You can make as many as you want, as long as you bring at least 3 dozen for swapping.<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Once the cookies have cooled, divide them into separate groups of <b>6 cookies per group<\/b>. For example, 48 cookies will make 8 groups. If only math could always be so delicious, right?<\/p> <p>4. Take your groupings (6 cookies each) and package them up for swapping. Keep it simple or get creative\u2014your choice. At least include a label for the cookies.<\/p> <p><br\/>5. In addition to the package labels, please print out a list of the ingredients to display at our event. You don't have to print the recipe . . . just the ingredients is enough.<\/p> <p><br\/>6. Oh, and save a couple cookies to put out on a plate for sampling.<\/p> <p><br\/>7. Be ready to bring home a fun variety of cookies, and maybe get a little inspiration for some new recipes!<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/p> <p><br\/>If you think about it, this type of event is really efficient. Seriously!<\/p> <p><br\/>No need to make several different types of cookies for a holiday party. It's time consuming and messy, with boatloads of dishwashing.<\/p> <p><br\/>Instead, you can take the variety of cookies from our Food Swap, group them on a platter, and look like the rock star that you are.<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/p> <p>Please feel free to invite your friends! Even if they are not members of the cookbook club, they are more than welcome to participate in our Food Swap events. Have them follow the directions listed above, and add them to your RSVP (so we have a head count).<\/p> <p>The venue offers a cash bar if you'd like to enjoy a refreshing beverage during the event. I'll bring some savory snacks for us to enjoy. Venue located near the Beverly MBTA station. On street parking available, in addition to a new parking garage across the street.<\/p> <p><br\/>Other than that . . . let's bake some cookies and get a sweet start to our Food Swap event series (January will be a soup swap).<\/p> <p><br\/>Feel free to comment with any ideas, questions, or some fun stories!<\/p> <p><br\/>I hope you can join us.<\/p> <p>Warmly,<\/p> <p>Jessica<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/feast-cookbook-club\/events\/226734913\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Food Swap \u2014 Holiday Cookies","id":"226734913","time":1450044000000,"updated":1450063313000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441822774000,"name":"feast :: a cookbook club","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":18915452,"urlname":"feast-cookbook-club","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Cookbook Collectors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"350 Massachusetts Avenue","address_2":"Between Central Square and MIT","lon":-71.099692,"phone":"(617) 577-9100","name":"The Asgard Irish Pub and Restaurant","id":855720,"state":"MA","lat":42.36236,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":1.52803456783,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448602542000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Salut, tout le monde,<br\/>Nous nous retrouverons le dimanche 13 d\u00e9cembre, au Asgard, Central Square, Cambridge, \u00e0 5:00P.M.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00c0 bient\u00f4t,\u00a0<br\/>Frantz<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Une table nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9e au fond du restaurant","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonFrenchConversationGroup\/events\/227048574\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"Rendez-vous du dimanche!","id":"227048574","time":1450044000000,"updated":1451013459000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1037728347000,"name":"The Boston French Language Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":63770,"urlname":"BostonFrenchConversationGroup","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"French Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"wellesley","address_1":"2 Central St, Wellesley, MA 02482","name":"Wellesley Congregational Church","lon":0,"id":23877198,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.7319068909,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433344678000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet every Sunday at 5:00 pm at Wellesley Congregational Church (2 Central St, Wellesley, MA 02482).

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

Hypnosis is neither Black Magic or Supernatural. Hypnotist or Hypnotherapist are not Psychics or Palm readers with \"Special Powers\". Hypnosis has been found to be a natural state of being and Hypnotherapy based on many years of clinical research by famous psychologist such a Dr. Sigmund Freud, Dr. Carl Jung and others. Would you like to learn how to end a cycle of unwanted behavior, Do you have a feeling inside that you don't like? Do you want to change something about yourself? Hypnosis can help and empowers us to: solve our own problems, gain strength, confidence, focus &amp; control, activate our inner healing powers and more.

Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

I\u2019m not crazy about those, though; I kinda feel like they \u201cmagically\u201d do too much, and that they might not encourage exploration and modification in the same way that Emacs generally does.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>I recently created <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hrs\/sensible-defaults.el\">sensible-defaults.el<\/a> as an alternative. It\u2019s a minimal set of configuration changes and keybindings: just enough to knock off some of the unnecessarily-sharp edges.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226956144\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlytqbsb","time":1450137600000,"updated":1450200273000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"66 Winthrop St.","name":"The University Lutheran Church","lon":-71.11998,"id":24112175,"state":"MA","lat":42.371719,"repinned":false},"headcount":16,"distance":2.68253827095,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449260143000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The first 10 pages of a script are extremely important for many reasons.

My course makes its unique contribution to this spiritual evolution in the following way: Creating Miracles Is A Three Step Process.<\/p> <p>\n\nStep 1) In my 42 hour Course, I will show \u00a0how quantum physics came to the conclusion that mind is prime in the universe, and not matter, and, therefore, mind can transmute matter. I will then give the evidence showing how mind actually enters the cells of the body, even changing the DNA. Applying quantum physics, we will no longer see the body as a machine, but as an energy\/information body operating as a messaging system.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I will show the scientific evidence that optimal health and miraculous recovery is possible when the quantum energy\/information waves carrying the messages are not blocked, but are effectively transmitted.<\/p> <p>\n\nStep 2) Yet, with all the scientific theory and evidence predicting miracles, we must ask why are physical healing miracles so rare. I will answer that question by showing the tricks our ego-mind (i.e., our usual mind) employs to keep us disempowered.<\/p> <p><br\/>Step 3) Once we see the tricks of our ego-mind, we will see the need to go beyond our usual mind by giving our allegiance to spirit in order to be empowered. After we see our need for spirit, for the first time, we will have \"new eyes to see\" all the scientific evidence, and testimonials that are proof of spiritual power.<\/p> <p><br\/>The combination of the scientific and testimonial evidence, and new eyes to see the evidence, results in a \"certainty\" about the reality of spirit, that one will experience being spiritual power, and no longer just \"trying\" to get spiritual power. One will be in the blessed state of \"the peace that passeth understanding,\" and the focused mind, which has proven to be the foundation for healing miracles.<\/p> <p>In addition, I have recently returned from the Institute of Noetic Sciences five day conference on the latest scientific discoveries supporting that spirit\/consciousness is prime in the universe and not matter, and\u00a0supporting\u00a0 the probability that we are immortal souls, and I will share\u00a0 that information in my presentation.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Bio:<br\/>Barry Harris worked at the Hippocrates Institute in Boston, writing health booklets for Dr. Ann Wigmore, discoverer of wheatgrass and founder of the live food movement. Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill. While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries. Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics (ie his college major) to Energy Medicine, cellular biology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\" which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book \"Beggars At God's Banquet\" based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing this fall or early winter.<\/p> <p>\n\nBarry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing. His voice students learn the relationship of ego to breath patterns, and how to surrender control to a higher power, which are insights he uses in his miracles course.. Barry is qualified to teach about miracles, because he had his own miracle. He restored his singing voice by recognizing the need for spiritual grace and surrender of control to a higher power, after Western doctors said he had damaged his voice beyond repair.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HOLISTIC-HEALTH-SPEAKER-SERIES-AND-STUDY-GROUP\/events\/226874177\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":9000000,"name":"INTRO.

The meditation helps to expand consciousness in a way which relaxes the mind, balances the emotions and rejuvenates the body. The meditation includes the chanting of powerful mantras, including the \"bija mantras\" (or seed sounds) for the chakras, and a visualization of kundalini energy as a golden fluid flowing into the chakras.<\/p> <p>Oneness Blessing is free, donations accepted for the use of the Wings Studio at Roots and Wings.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Roots and Wings 317 N.

The energy embodied within this two billion year old stone absorbs and eliminates anything that is harmful to human health. Feeling the vibration of shungite is a special experience and this master healing stone will help you bring its amazing powers into your life.<br\/>Noble shungite has around a 98% carbon lattice and contains the building blocks of life. This natural mineral contains nearly the whole periodic table, yet it only gives us what we need to grow and takes what doesn't serve us. Shungite is so special because it contains buckminsterfullerenes. The dodecahedron shape of these fullerenes is the most powerful sacred geometry found in nature. Sporting a soccer ball-like pattern, the buckminsterfullerene molecule has 60 carbon atoms which form a stable, hollow sphere. It's the largest molecule found in space!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Shungite healing properties:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022A natural antioxidant that can increase human immunity with regards to many serious illnesses and suppress the development of many allergic diseases<br\/>\u2022A sorbent, purifying air and water from many organic and inorganic compounds and from excess of free radicals<br\/>\u2022A catalyst, which ensures decomposition of organic substances sorbed and restoration of the sorption properties<br\/>\u2022A carrier of wide range of microelements and biologically active substances, intensifying biological processes in the bodies of human beings and animals<br\/>\u2022A material, actively interacting with electromagnetic fields of different nature (anthropogenic high-frequency, solar, geopathogenic, biofields) and neutralizing their negative impact.<br\/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be answering the wake-up call to the divine presence ... And trust me, if you come, you will hear it ringing ; ) Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Pllease bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are.
