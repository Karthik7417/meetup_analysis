All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

I've been here with friends a few times so far, usually for dinner &amp; drinks during Friday happy hour. Everything about this place is classy &amp; well done, far superior to most of the other bars\/restaurants on Mamaroneck Ave. The wine: Lily's has a wonderful selection of wine on tap, which can be hard to find. Although it is mostly domestic wines, there's good variety &amp; quality. From these, I particularly recommend the A to Z Chardonnay &amp; the Concannon Cabernet Sauvignon. Aside from the wine on tap, there are a few other wines that can be ordered by the glass &amp; then a great selection of wines by the bottle. Here they have a wide selection of quality wines that one would expect from a wine bar. I'm particularly impressed by the variety of Italian wines.<\/p> <p>Aside from wine, there is a great selection of beers and a full bar. During happy hour (Mon-Fri 4-7pm), beer and wine on tap is only $5! \u00a0<\/p> <p>The food: I've tried two of the personal pizza selections at Lily's - pizza fresca &amp; meat stacking pizza.

Their show is built around the astounding songs and music collected by Englishmen Cecil Sharp and Maud Karpeles.

The night will feature eight leading artists presenting works of immersive audience experience. It will be presented in partnership with CultureHub at their new space in La MaMa.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Artists involved include: Catalonian Cyborg pioneers Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas. Harbisson will perform A Concert from Space via his antenna that is embedded into his skull. Ribas will showcase her piece Waiting for Earthquakes, where she connects her sensors to the seismology satellite in space and dance as earthquakes happen at any given moment, The two artists will perform simultaneously.\u00a0<\/p> <p>MSHR duo and Portland-based artists Brenna Murphy and Birch Cooper produce unusual installations and live performances that revolve around a unique system of light-audio feedback, employing handmade synthesizers, sculptural interfaces and ritualistic shamanic performances, placing the human body into a dynamic relationship between the ultra-terrestrial and the tribal.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Juan Cortes and Ricardo Arias, both artists visiting from Bogota, Colombia for MOMA\u2019s hybrid media exhibition, present their latest performance collaborating as \u201cThe Migrants\u201d. Tidal Flares is a performance-installation that draws its inspiration from the dramatic effect of solar flares on the Earth\u2019s behaviors, in both its organic and its inorganic systems. The performers will interfere\/interact with this activity via sensors in ways akin to those deployed by certain biological organisms such as bioluminiscent algae, frogs, tarantulas etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yucef Merhi, a New York based Venezuelan artist, will present Facial Poetry, a playful multiuser installation where facial gestures are transformed into hundreds of poems.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mark Bolotin will showcase The Lumiphonic Creature Choir, a futuristic installation which consists of a giant twelve-headed multimedia creature that triggers faces talking about their vision of the future.

It is a festival of worship, dance and music celebrated over a period of nine nights. It is celebrated from the first to the ninth date of Ashwin Shukla Paksha of the Hindu Calendar for the worship of the Goddess Durga. This festival commemorates the victory of Goddess Durga over a demon, Mahishasur.<\/p> <p>During Navratri, devotees of Durga fast and pray for health and prosperity. It is an occasion for vibrant festivities. The Garba or Dandiya Raas is the most significant feature during the festival of Navratri. This is the traditional and folk dance of the state of Gujarat, but today, everyone performs this dance with great fervor and enthusiasm. During the dance, a decorated pot is ceremoniously placed with a light inside and the women folk dance in a circle, singing 'traditional songs' or 'garbas'.<\/p> <p>Then there is a pooja on each day of this holy period where Goddess Durga, known in this state as Ambe Maa is worshipped for prosperity and happiness. During all the nine nights, men, women and children flock together in the street and peform Garba-Raas in circumambulation around the statue of devi, accompanied by religious songs eulogizing the Mother-Goddess in tune with instrumental music till late night which has deep socio-religious impact on the Hindu society. A Mandvi of the Goddess is framed by woodcarving in which a small idol of Mother Goddess is placed with a number of ghee lamps. The devotees put this Mandvi on their heads and maintaining balance, perform Garba-dance.<\/p> <p>Gujarat is the cardinal center for the celebration of Navratri Mahotsava, where young men and women wearing traditional attire dance with zeal, joy, jubilation and devotional fervor, till late mid-night. Out of the nine forms of Mother-Goddess, the triumvirate of Mahakali, Maha-Laxmi and Maha-Sarasvati symbolize prowess, affluence and erudition - the most essential things for the prosperity and progress of mankind. the Mother-Goddess grants all these three to the devotees who observe Navratri in right spirit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------------<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet us between 9:00pm and 9:15pm in front of the White Castle at 2995 John F Kennedy Blvd. One of us will be holding a sign that says \"MEETUP\".

Participants are briefly walked through their bodies while sitting quietly. A period of silent follows\u00a0for 20-25 minutes. Whenever the mind wanders and seeks out a satisfaction outside of the self, the meditator steers consciousness back to her breath. In this way we practice mindfulness, focus, and discernment. The mind simplifies its activities as the body relaxes.<\/p> <p>Meditation is easy to do but, like most simple things, mastery requires regular practice.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoodsprograms to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/226158525\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"226158525","time":1445690700000,"updated":1445959583000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1441052604000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Please be there 15 minutes earlier so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Soccer-Pickup\/events\/\"><b>here<\/b><\/a> for\u00a0our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><b>Game style and Rules:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The valley and stream are remarkably accessible and sleepy to this day, flowing through Rockefeller State Park, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, and the village of Sleepy Hollow\u2019s Douglas Park. Roaming the endless carriage roads of the state park or wandering among the monuments of the cemetery it\u2019s easy to conjure an image of Ichabod Crane making his way to his schoolhouse. In the gathering gloom of some overcast autumn afternoon, you might just hear hoofbeats approaching from behind. But don\u2019t panic\u2014the state park allows equestrian access to some trails. If you wish to make your own horseback ride through Sleepy Hollow, there is horse trailer parking at the park\u2019s main entrance on Route 117.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.sleepyholloween.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/cemetery-bridge.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquility.<\/p> <p>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.sleepyholloween.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/pocantico.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW\u2026-The Legend of Sleepy Hollow<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The Great Jack O\u2019Lantern Blaze, (Optional)<\/p> <p>The tri-state area\u2019s biggest, most exciting, most electrifying Halloween event!

This is the first time I\u2019ll be leading an event to the High Bridge. Closed for some 40 years, this walkway very recently opened up. It spans the Harlem River and connects Manhattan to the Bronx and was once used to bring water from the Croton Aqueduct to New York City. (The Manhattan Boro President said \u201cThis is almost the eighth wonder of the world\u201d and that is one great exaggeration but it is pretty cool to walk over it.)There are some really nice views from the Bridge-and no cars.\u00a0Before we visit the High Bridge we\u2019ll explore what was once the little village of Carmansville located in the West 150\u2019s and then we\u2019ll walk back and forth over the High Bridge. WE WILL THEN CLIMB UP ONE HUGE FLIGHT OF STAIRS-trust me this is the best way to do this for a number of reasons-and then we\u2019ll make our way to scenic Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan where there will be a lunch stop and a possible optional brief stop at the Cloisters. THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF SURPRISES ON THIS ONE. (I haven\u2019t done Part I yet in case you are wondering\u00a0!). I\u2019ll stop a few times to talk about what we see but this will mostly be non-stop action until we get to the Cloisters where we can relax a bit.<\/p> <p>BRING LUNCH. NO FOOD STOPS TO BUY LUNCH.<\/p> <p>We will meet BEFORE 10:45 A.M. to sign in. WE LEAVE PROMPTLY.<\/p> <p>MEETING DETAILS WILL BE SENT BY E-MAIL TO THOSE WHO RSVP THE EVENING BEFORE THE HIKE.

Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails from Yahoo. (Contact me a day or so before the hike if you are a dues paying AMC Club member and don\u2019t get these e-mails and I\u2019ll tell you how).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup event that I have led or are an abuser of the RSVP process\u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up.

You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 7:30 A.M. If there is no notice, we go.

Next, men go one direction, and woman another, and you enter the locker rooms. First thing you do is take off your shoes (it's only polite!) and put them in a little cubbie that opens when you wave your magic wristband in front of it. Then there's another, larger locker for your clothing. Then you change into the provided tee shirt &amp; shorts uniform and meet up with your friends of the opposite sex upstairs. If you're staying in the women's or men's locker room section, (my favorite), they've got everything you could ever need to spend hours relaxing.<\/p> <p><br\/>They've got pools with the massage jets, they have sleeping rooms, relax rooms, things to read, stuff to watch on TV, and numerous helpful attendants to answer questions, and be friendly. The hot tubs and pools in the mens and women's locker rooms are wonderful, but you are not allowed to wear bathing suits there.. If you're uncomfortable being nude, you'll forget all about that in about 5 minutes or you can just go upstairs and use the pools on the other floors. You can even get an exfoliating body scrub or massage if you want to spend a little more money. And they charge it all to that wristband thingy you're wearing.<\/p> <p><b>Upstairs is uniform only (unless you're in a pool, in which case you'll need a bathing suit). You may want to bring a larger towel for when you get out of the outdoor pools on the roof - as it can be chilly (actually you're usually quite warm in the water, and steaming when you get out.. but a beach towel is nice...)<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet up at some point for a late lunch, (they have sushi, a juice bar, and American snack food) then check out all of the amazing saunas, purchase a massage, and do numerous other pampering activities.<\/p> <p>Upstairs further are the unisex, bathing suit required pools. They have a massaging jet to hit every acupuncture point you can imagine.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

This is a great novel for those of you who have expressed interested in meta-fiction. Also, after several books in the 500-page range, this book is a very manageable 240.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Lydia Davis is considered one of the most original minds in American fiction today. Her numerous accolades include a MacAuthor Fellowship (the \"genius\" grant), a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Man Booker International Award, and the Whiting Writer's Award. She has been a finalist for the PEN\/Hemingway Award and National Book Award. Davis is also a French scholar and has translated works by Flaubert and Proust, whose works have influenced her own.<\/p> <p>True to its title, <i>The End of the Story<\/i> begins at the end of the love affair at its heart. Flashing forward a year, the nameless narrator, a writer and university teachers, goes on to tell us of her failed attempts to find \"him\" (also nameless) in a strange city. The hope is all the more urgent in that she is writing a novel about the very novel we are reading.<\/p> <p>Like many contemporary novels, <i>The End of the Story<\/i> is in large part about itself, about the painful process of its own making. It is about the strange paradox under which all writers labor, namely that the very attempt to clarify our experience can end up obscuring it.\u00a0The simplicity and precision of Davis' prose (often described as poetic) only intensifies this sense of the profound elusiveness of life and love.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/224834853\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Lydia Davis' The End of the Story--MacAuthor Fellowship, Man Booker Award","id":"224834853","time":1445706000000,"updated":1445714726000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"384 3rd Ave","name":"Whitman and Bloom","lon":-73.981117,"id":19856692,"lat":40.741608,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.744767010212,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444611690000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Hello Fall!!!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Hope all are ready to enjoy the crisp air, pretty leaves, pumpkins and s'mores.<\/b><\/p> <p>Lets get together, enjoy some good food with brunch drinks and make some new desi friends.<\/p> <p>How about brunch at '<b>Whitman and Bloom<\/b>'.

I assume that many of you are actually reading this description right now because you\u2019re interested in understanding yourself and the world better (among other things, of course). The above title and accompanying question have both caught your attention. (For some of you it may be part of the \u201creason\u201d why you participate in intellectual discussion groups on Meetup.)<\/p> <p>\n\nMany people also believe that higher-level reasoning processes\u2014such as the critical thinking skills of analysis and evaluation\u2014can help them achieve this level of understanding. (It\u2019s not necessarily that anyone thinks that these are the sole methods of achieving understanding; reasoning processes are, however, a very important, predominant means of doing so by some standards.)<\/p> <p>\n\nWe\u2019ll consider this lofty topic through a series of questions that will get us closer and closer to comprehending the relationship between knowledge and reason.<\/p> <p>\n\nSome of the questions we will consider include, but are not limited to:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022What might it mean to \u201cunderstand\u201d one\u2019s self? To understand the world around us?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 How might the processes of reasoning help us to accomplish this understanding?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0What is the relationship between (and distinction among) reasoning on the one hand and other forms of knowing on the other\u2014such as intuition, imagination, and emotions? (For example, is there a false dichotomy between reasoning and emotions, reasoning and imagination; which might have a greater influence over the other: reasoning over emotion or vice versa, is it possible to separate the relationship between the two?)<\/p> <p>\n\n\u2022\u00a0What might science in general and scientific reasoning in particular have to teach us about this topic?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 What are the limitations of reasoning in terms of helping us understand ourselves? Is there a danger in relying predominately on reasoning in this respect?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe will be gathered together for one day, for two and a half hours, to discuss these and other questions.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe format of our discussion will be as follows:<br\/>\u2022 We will consider some definitions of reason and knowledge and their relationships;<br\/>\u2022 We will discuss and debate the extent to which we can know ourselves and the world around us more accurately and more effectively;<br\/>\u2022 We will consider the implications and applications of our discussion to our lives and those around us;<br\/>\u2022 We will share some past examples of how we think we have reasoned our way to a greater self-understanding in our lives; or, conversely, we will provide evidence and reasoning to explain how we think we can\u2019t!<\/p> <p>About the Moderator:<br\/>Rolando is an educator of educators.

Be sure to dress creatively! There is a costume contest at the end. We\u2019ll be offered drink specials by each of our pub hosts, and have a fun afternoon adventure here in Queens.<\/p> <p>And, as is our tradition, we will not only enjoy ourselves, but also work to raise money for a local non-profit. This year, we're going to raise funds in support of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scsny.org\/\"><b>Sunnyside Community Services<\/b><\/a>, a great neighborhood organization that provides a broad range of services to approximately 14,000 people per year including children, youth, adults, and seniors.<\/p> <p><b>About the Pub Run<\/b><br\/>We began our Halloween tradition five years ago, which was unfortunately timed to coincide with a freak, slushy October blizzard (two of the participants actually enjoyed the adventure so much that they are now married). Last year, 55+ runners participated with some awesome costumes, and we raised a couple thousand dollars for a local non-profit while enjoying beverages and great company. This year, we will do the same!<\/p> <p><b>Please RSVP now<\/b>, prepare your costume and plan to join us. The more the merrier, so bring anybody else you can fool into thinking this is something that sane people do. Please do RSVP\u00a0so we can get an idea of how many people to expect (it\u2019s easier to encourage bar owners to give us good stuff if we have lots of people signed up).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Are you afraid that you might not be able to run 3ish miles in a Halloween costume while drinking? You should be, but not really. We\u2019ll be stopping a bunch of times (at each pub), making the actual running distances quite short. We\u2019re also extremely casual and will not leave anybody behind. The run between pubs will be comfortable-pace and friendly, suitable for just about everybody from beginning runners to marathoners and everything in-between. If you have friends or relatives who wish to join us and they insist upon only walking, please contact your organizer who can provide them with an appropriate route.<\/p> <p>Additionally, we won't force you to drink at every pub if you don\u2019t wish - we\u2019re all about safety and enjoyment! There will be plenty of water and food opportunities available to balance things out.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>You won\u2019t know which pubs we\u2019ll hit until we arrive at each. This makes things more fun, keeps the group together and lets everybody focus on socializing and enjoying the adventure.<\/p> <p><i><b>NOTE TO THE MARATHONERS: If you are planning to run the NYC Marathon a week after this event and are not drinking, but would love to participate, your organizer needs your help.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

These instructions offer essential practices for cultivating the awakening mind of compassion, wisdom, and love. This eight-verse lojong enshrines the very heart of Dharma, revealing the true essence of the Mahayana path to liberation. Even a single line of this practice can be seen as encapsulating the entire teaching of the Buddha. For even a single statement of this mind training practice has the incredible power to help us subdue our self-oriented behavior and mental afflictions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The fundamental theme of mind training practice is the profound reorientation of our basic attitude, both toward our own self and toward our fellow human beings, as well as toward the events around us. The goal of mind training practice is the radical transformation of our thoughts, attitudes, and habits. Presently, we tend to cherish the welfare of our own self at the expense of all others. However, the mind training teaching challenges us to reverse this process. This involves a deep understanding of others as true friends, and the recognition that our true enemy lies inside of ourselves, not outside.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As we practice these lojong teachings in daily life, we train the mind to embrace reality in a completely wholesome, wise, and compassionate way. These excellent practices help us purify our negativity and awaken the heart by giving us a way to transform adversity, conflict, and hardship into a direct opportunity for spiritual growth. In this way, rather than perceiving difficult people or adverse circumstances in our lives as an obstacle, tragedy, or punishment, we now meet these experiences with deep compassion, wisdom, and skill\u2014using them as our actual practice on the path to enlightenment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>By way of these treasured practices we eliminate our competitive, selfish, and emotionally reactive nature, as well as our false and exaggerated concepts of self (also called self-grasping and self-cherishing). It is important to understand that the greed, jealousy, anger, pride, selfishness, and attachment, which cause us so much suffering, are actually misperceptions of reality, not inherent conditions of our mind. Therefore, these precious lojong practices can purify our misperceptions and delusions completely, revealing the natural radiance, clarity, wisdom, and compassion of our true nature.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/0\/3\/600_443088131.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nby Geshe Langri Thangpa<\/p> <p>By thinking of all sentient beings<br\/>As more precious than a wish-fulfilling jewel<br\/>For accomplishing the highest aim,<br\/>I will always hold them dear.<\/p> <p>Whenever I\u2019m in the company of others,<br\/>I will regard myself as the lowest among all,<br\/>And from the depths of my heart<br\/>Cherish others as supreme.<\/p> <p>In my every action, I will watch my mind,<br\/>And the moment destructive emotions arise,<br\/>I will confront them strongly and avert them,<br\/>Since they will hurt both me and others.<\/p> <p>Whenever I see ill-natured beings,<br\/>Or those overwhelmed by heavy misdeeds or suffering,<br\/>I will cherish them as something rare,<br\/>As though I\u2019d found a priceless treasure.<\/p> <p>Whenever someone out of envy<br\/>Does me wrong by attacking or belittling me,<br\/>I will take defeat upon myself,<br\/>And give the victory to others.<\/p> <p>Even when someone I have helped,<br\/>Or in whom I have placed great hopes<br\/>Mistreats me very unjustly,<br\/>I will view that person as a true spiritual teacher.<\/p> <p>In brief, directly or indirectly,<br\/>I will offer help and happiness to all my mothers,<br\/>And secretly take upon myself<br\/>All their hurt and suffering.<\/p> <p>I will learn to keep all these practices<br\/>Untainted by thoughts of the eight worldly concerns.<br\/>May I recognize all things as like illusions,<br\/>And, without attachment, gain freedom from bondage.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are one block from the Nassau st G station.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bkawake\/events\/225959621\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":10800000,"name":"Eight Verses for Training the Mind","id":"sdjxklytnbgc","time":1445709600000,"updated":1445721859000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434415928000,"name":"Brooklyn Awakening Meditation and Dharma Center","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18675566,"urlname":"bkawake","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Knowledge Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"21-A Clinton St, New York City, NY 10002","name":"The Cow NYC","lon":-73.984406,"id":24109605,"state":"NY","lat":40.720665,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.05212593079,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431308022000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Order tickets via Eventbrite:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/thrill-the-world-nyc-2015-tickets-16927870717?aff=efbevent\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/thrill-the-world-nyc-2015-tickets-16927870717?aff=efbevent<\/a><\/p> <p>Thrill The World NYC 2015 presents it's first ever ZOMBIE MASQUERADE BALL with GLOBAL LIVE <i>THRILLER dance at 6pm on \u00a0<\/i>Saturday, October 24th EST (Event is from 2pm-6pm)<\/p> <p>Welcome to your official New York Connection to \"Thrill The World 2015\", an annual worldwide simultaneous dance of \"Thriller\" for world records and charity.

About one month ago, our city and the world had a lot of religious-based activities with the Papal visit, Yom Kippur, Eid ul Adha, happening in one week. This I found interesting and gave rise to the thought of having this meetup relating religion (or a lackthereof) to Happiness.<\/p> <p>We have many questions to explore and will keep an even-flow convo over the subject of how following religion, not following, and\/or creating our own spiritual practice ties into our happiness levels. How do we direct our consciousness out to the world, what guides our actions and ultimately takes tolls on our happiness? Do we live life through a religious lens or lackthereof? Do we have spirit? Does a who\/what enable each of our spirits to continue? We will explore these and hopefully many others provided time. To attend, please read below.<\/p> <p><br\/>Note: by choosing to attend, you are agreeing to be respectful and sensitive to the believers and non-believers at the table (meaning no eye rolling, sighs, firm stances that indirectly insult, denigrating remarks, or passive aggressiveness whatsoever. We are all functional adults and will behave as one functional cohesive unit).<\/p> <p>- As there likely be far opposites in this conversational theme, I will remind you that you are not attending to preach that God\/Jesus loves all, to convince others that God does or doesn't exist, or to promote or push other dogmatic ideas and positions on others. You WILL be asked to leave otherwise. Nevertheless, we will have a stimulating and interesting conversation! All attending will be asked to share their life experience(s) in the religion arena and how they connect to happiness; we will also branch the conversation globally.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1202182087\/time-totalk-find-your-conversation\">*Check out CNY's first Kickstarter Campaign!<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>----<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/events\/219754221\/\">A Conversation About Happiness<\/a><\/p> <p>Alternating Hosts:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/3373400\/\">George<\/a>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/142605152\/\">Michael Y<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/3373400\/\">&lt;\/a&gt; CitiCorp Atrium Lower Level<br\/>153 E 53rd street (Between Lexington and 3rd ave)<\/p> <p>From 5:00pm-7:30pm (it's okay to arrive late or leave early.).\u00a0Look for our red Meetup Sign.<\/p> <p>Get ready to get happier simply by talking about happiness! The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6.

About one month ago, our city and the world had a lot of religious-based activities with the Papal visit, Yom Kippur, Eid ul Adha, happening in one week. This I found interesting and gave rise to the thought of having this meetup relating religion (or a lackthereof) to Happiness.<\/p> <p>We have many questions to explore and will keep an even-flow convo over the subject of how following religion, not following, and\/or creating our own spiritual practice ties into our happiness levels. How do we direct our consciousness out to the world, what guides our actions and ultimately takes tolls on our happiness? Do we live life through a religious lens or lackthereof? Do we have spirit? Does a who\/what enable each of our spirits to continue? We will explore these and hopefully many others provided time. To attend, please read below.<\/p> <p>Note: by choosing to attend, you are agreeing to be respectful and sensitive to the believers and non-believers at the table (meaning no eye rolling, sighs, firm stances that indirectly insult, denigrating remarks, or passive aggressiveness whatsoever. We are all functional adults and will behave as one functional cohesive unit).<\/p> <p>- As there likely be far opposites in this conversational theme, I will remind you that you are not attending to preach that God\/Jesus loves all, to convince others that God does or doesn't exist, or to promote or push other dogmatic ideas and positions on others. You WILL be asked to leave otherwise. Nevertheless, we will have a stimulating and interesting conversation! All attending will be asked to share their life experience(s) in the religion arena and how they connect to happiness; we will also branch the conversation globally.<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/events\/219754221\/\">A Conversation About Happiness<\/a><\/p> <p>Alternating Hosts:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/3373400\/\">George<\/a>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversations-New-York\/members\/142605152\/\">Michael Y<\/a><\/p> <p>CitiCorp Atrium Lower Level<br\/>153 E 53rd street (Between Lexington and 3rd ave)<\/p> <p>From 5:00pm-7:30pm (it's okay to arrive late or leave early.).\u00a0Look for our red Meetup Sign.<\/p> <p>Get ready to get happier simply by talking about happiness! The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6.

Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game.

Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/225988259\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"pckzrytnbgc","time":1445722200000,"updated":1445889478000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 45th Street (Between 6th & 7th Ave.)","name":"Cranberry Cafe","lon":-73.94519,"id":6580602,"state":"NY","lat":40.813438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.9805932045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445316050000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0thought it would be fun thing for the month of October to explore some of the darker arts and sides of various genres.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Light of Iris is a Shamanic healing ceremony that uses meditation, journaling, dance, drawing, music, and .... more to help facilitate lasting emotional healing and a permanent expansion of consciousness. For some that means increased creativity, for others that can mean healing deeply repressed childhood wounds in a matter of hours, for some it can mean reawakening a connection to ones ancestors and their power. It is named after my late Great Grandmother Iris Palmer who came to me in a vision as pure light during a previous ceremony. I don't have the right words to describe the impact that had on me, but we do want to share that possibility with others. This is about remembering who you are and standing in that power.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/225633255\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":7200000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Ariyadeva!","id":"cltxklytnbgc","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736172000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441718410000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/a\/b\/600_441771371.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join Kate Smith in her Gong Meditation- Sacred Sound Healing Event at Neolyth<\/p> <p>Celestial, cosmic, oceanic, otherworldly \u2026 words can\u2019t really describe the experience of a gong meditation.

Raised by a military father and feminist mother, Christine is no stranger to adversity. Her<b> autobiographical EP tells tales of her struggles to find solace as a lesbian during her 10-year stint in the US Army at the height of the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" period<\/b>, to her battle to recover and regain sanity after an attempt to take her own life, <b>to her spiritual awakening, and finally - to finding peace<\/b>.<\/p> <p>Christine was raised in the small town of Readington, NJ. Throughout her life she looked to music as her comfort and escape. Over the past decade, she has refined a style that marries both raw grit and tender warmth akin to Janis Joplin and Chrissie Hynde. She has cultivated a home for herself within the historic music scene of Asbury Park and her grass-roots following of loyal supporters have dubbed themselves the \"Tucci Train\". Christine has opened for national recording acts including Gavin DeGraw, Michele Branch, Patty Smythe and Scandal, and Mountain.<\/p> <p>Most recently, she teamed up with two time Grammy Award Winner Marc Swersky (Joe Cocker, Hilary Duff, Roger Daltrey) and Brielle Brown (Gedeon Luke, Jacquie Lee). Together they wrote the confessional Angels of War over a four-month period. Topping off the record are two songs co-written by renowned songwriter Charlie Midnight (James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Joe Cocker). The EP was recorded live at Shorefire Recording Studios in Long Branch, NJ and produced by Swersky. It features the musicianship of Steve Holley (Paul McCartney and The Wings) on drums, Vincent Mascolo (Tunnels to Holland), and top NYC session keyboardist Alan Markley.\u00a0 At the root of Angels of War is a story of survival, resilience, and love. It's an honest portrayal of a woman who served her country and is now serving her heart.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Event Organizer & Group Member Lillian Vinci (Aka The Lady Trainer) will let folks confirmed know","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GayCatholics\/events\/225511334\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"COMMUNITY:Fundraiser For Homeless LGBT Youth -http:\/\/www.newalternativesnyc.org\/","id":"225511334","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445739271000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348229327000,"name":"Gay Catholics, Christians & Friends - Social Group","group_lon":-74,"id":5035262,"urlname":"GayCatholics","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Gay Catholics & Christians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"jersey city","address_1":"54  Journal Square plaza","name":"Landmark Loew's Jersey","lon":-74.064583,"id":19381362,"state":"NJ","lat":40.732311,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":4.09972143173,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445639860000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Loew's Jersey is an amazing theater that opened it's doors in 1929.

It sounds interesting, although it is expensive (I'm a member). I always wanted to explore Green-Wood by night. As the date gets closer, we can see if more people are interested. Although, many of Green-Wood's events sell out pretty quickly, but, if this doesn't work out, there are plenty of others.<br\/>Into the Veil: An After Dark Exploration<br\/>Saturday, October 24, 8:00 pm - 1:00 am Into The Veil<\/p> <p>Where Green-Wood\u2019s Gothic arch rises above Brooklyn there exists a portal between the land of the living and the realm of the dead. Since the 19th century, that brownstone gate has represented the connection between those two spaces. On this special autumn evening, cross that portal and join Green-Wood and Atlas Obscura for a night of exploration and discovery. Attendees will make their own ways, on their own unique adventures, weaving together stories from the 560,000 lives interred across Green-Wood\u2019s historic 478 acres. Navigating below the silhouettes of thousands of starlit trees, curiosity will lead you through winding pathways, revealing hidden spaces of music, history, and experience. Music performances, readings, stargazing, and other activities will unfold over the course of the night, and each attendee will choose where their own night will lead. Just as Green-Wood was designed as a place for Victorian New Yorkers to step between the veil of life and the afterlife, so too will modern visitors transport into a liminal space where the city\u2019s past and present meet.<\/p> <p>$60 for members of Green-Wood and BHS\/$65 for non-members.<\/p> <p>Green-Wood members can buy tickets to all public programs before the general public.

We take you deep into the underworld of one of NYC\u2019s most beloved neighborhoods: Greenwich Village. Now a hub for trendy restaurants, celebrity pads and hangouts for NYC\u2019s elite, Greenwich Village was once home to parlor houses, speakeasies and gambling halls - and all the debauchery that followed. On this tour, visit the infamous \"House of Death,\" the NYU hall that Edgar Allen Poe haunts and many more ghostly sites. The shadowy past of this quaint neighborhood still haunts the city today.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226161394\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytnbhc","time":1445778000000,"updated":1445789891000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443699388000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>12 to 13 miles at a moderate pace.\u00a0 Walk from Philipse Manor through Sleepy Hollow Cemetery to the Rockefeller Preserve.

The rail-trail has been built in segments, and there is still work to be done to open all <b>46 miles<\/b> of the paved road trail. Virginia has volunteered to guide those doing a shorter 25 miles total also.<\/p> <p>The southern end of the trail begins at the Metro North Railroad Station in Wassaic, New York. It is possible, during non-rush hours and on weekends, to board a Metro North train in Grand Central Station and in a little more than two hours be peddling or walking along this rail-trail. As the trail points north for nearly 11 miles to Millerton, it passes through a pastoral scene. Farmland stretches before and around you, followed by red-cedar scrubland and beaver ponds. In Amenia, the trailhead parking lot is on the site of the former Barton House, a large hotel.<\/p> <p><br\/>Several railroad stations on this line have been restored: Sharon Station is now a private residence located off the trail in the town of North East. Millerton's three stations have been restored and today house local businesses. North of Coleman Station the trail crosses six reconstructed railroad bridges.<\/p> <p>The railroad builders tamed the area's rolling terrain, and created a level corridor, by blasting through rock and building the rail bed up from the land adjacent to the corridor for a \"pyramiding\" effect. In several stretches, north of Route 61, the trail's higher elevation on steep embankments , in some places dropping 50 feet\u2014provides spectacular views of the surrounding farmland. Indian Mountain, straddling the border of New York and Connecticut, is to the east. Traveling through a series of deep rock cuts, you will feel the temperature drop several degrees from the surrounding landscape.<\/p> <p>The next 8 miles of the railroad corridor between Main Street in Millerton and Under Mountain Road in Ancram are not open for public use.<\/p> <p>Reaching the next open trail section requires a detour on a two-lane road. Head west on Main Street in Millerton and then north on New York State Route 22 for about 7.7 miles. Turn right on Under Mountain Road and look for the trailhead on the left. The 4-mile paved section of trail between Under Mountain Road and Taconic State Park is more wooded where the trail hugs the base of the South Taconic Mountains.<\/p> <p>About 2.9 miles north of Under Mountain Road, the trail detours onto a scenic dirt road for 0.4 mile to bypass a privately held parcel of rail bed. The dirt road rejoins the paved rail-trail for another 0.5 mile to the entrance to Taconic State Park at Copake Falls. Scenic Bash Bish Falls is located about 1 mile east of the trailhead, just over the Massachusetts state border. Follow the hiking trail to reach the falls.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.traillink.com\/submit\/submittraildescription.aspx?AcctID=6016782\">Edit Description<\/a> Parking and Trail Access<\/p> <p>To reach the Wassaic trailhead: From I-84 or I-684, take State Route 22 north at Brewster. Continue north on Route 22 to the Wassaic Station of the Metro North Railroad. The station is on the right side of the road.<\/p> <p>To reach the Taconic State Park Trailhead: From I-84 or I-684, take State Route 22 north to Brewster. Continue north on Route 22 to State Route 344, about 6 miles north of Millerton. Turn right and proceed about 0.5 mile to the triangular green. Bear to the left to the stop sign.

Frequently, however, this openness masks a reluctance to explore the very traditions out of which we ourselves have emerged. In this series Rev. Robb will take a fresh look at the spiritual insightfulness and moral imagination contained in the teaching of Jesus while emphasizing how they may continue to be revelatory in our current context. It is always surprising to look carefully at the actual words of great teachers with whom we have assumed we were fairly familiar and to discover new ways of understanding and fresh insights of which we were unaware. In this series we will examine in depth some of the stories Jesus told\u2014the parables\u2014which were probably the most characteristic and innovative way he had to convey his own spiritual vision.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>\u00a0Rev.

Any action that remains unfulfilled as per our fantasy, either due to hindrance from the outside world or from within can be termed as an incompletion. This can be either with ourselves or with another person. If we want a friend to live up to certain expectations that he or she can not honour, then it leads to incompletion. The first step to healing such an incompletion is to render the relationship complete. The only way to do this is by facing the other person and healing the hurt caused in the relationship. This can also be done by invoking their presence if they are no longer physically present. This process of completion and subsequent healing is absolutely necessary. Unless we are complete in all dimensions, life does not begin \u2013 living does not happen in us.<\/p> <p>Similarly, incompletion also happens internally. Any unfulfilled desire or fantasy carried by us, relating to ourselves, remains as an incompletion. The ideas which we have about us, we should either fulfill them or drop them. If we can not afford to fulfill them with our adopted lifestyle then dropping those will bring about completion with ourselves. For completion to happen, authentic listening needs to happen first. We need to authentically listen to the cries of our heart. This does not mean we will do everything that our heart wants. Just listening to our heart can give tremendous self satisfaction. Completion with ourselves involves giving ourselves the much needed self-attention. It even cures physical pain, as pain is a simple manifestation of being unable to sit comfortably with oneself.<\/p> <p>When there is a disturbance, the source is invariably from within us. Be it any kind of hindrance, this technique of completion within the self will be the path to enriching one\u2019s life and cleansing the body of all negativity in its varied forms.<\/p> <p><br\/>by Nithyananda Times on May 29, 2013 in Completion, Meditation<br\/>Be Complete!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Port-Washington-Healing-Insight-Transformation-is-Meditation\/events\/226218481\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Are you incomplete with you?
