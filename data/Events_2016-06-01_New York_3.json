Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/230952321\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Tennis This Monday @ Crotona Park","id":"230952321","time":1462827600000,"updated":1462906766000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07067","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Woodbridge","address_1":"300 Fairview Ave","address_2":"Merrill Drive & Fairview Avenue","lon":-74.312233,"phone":"908-463-5566","name":"Merrill Park","id":727979,"state":"NJ","lat":40.577099,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.7288951874,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462809511000,"fee":{"amount":3.5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Payment will not be required to RSVP for these, but PLEASE update your rsvp asap if you can't make it.

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HolisticWellnessNYC\/events\/230661527\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":3600000,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"clmvslyvhbmb","time":1462831200000,"updated":1462835651000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1208194158000,"name":"\"Holistic Wellness NYC - Outdoor, Yoga, Hiking, Mind, Body\"","group_lon":-74,"id":1109519,"urlname":"HolisticWellnessNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Fans of Wellness"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10021","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1020 Lexington Avenue","name":"Lexington Bar And Books","lon":-73.962013,"id":12348732,"state":"NY","lat":40.771019,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.06656599045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462236398000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/36879024\/msndflier.png\" \/><\/p> <p>On Monday, May 9th, join New York City cigar and scotch enthusiasts for our first ever event at Lexington Bar &amp; Books.

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mind-body-NYC\/events\/230777739\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics  (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"230777739","time":1462831200000,"updated":1462835656000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1131856693000,"name":"Mind & Body NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":214083,"urlname":"mind-body-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"MindBody Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"40 W 40th St","lon":-73.98307,"phone":"(212) 642-2260","name":"Cellar Bar @ Bryant Park Hotel","id":503466,"state":"NY","lat":40.752724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.409218966961,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434590747000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dear friends,<\/p> <p>Thank you for making our weekly Social Monday's a great success.<\/p> <p>Pictures posted below !\u00a0Let's meet again at Cellar Bar to socialize, and make new friends.<\/p> <p>Special Thanks&amp;Hugs\u24c7 to the new members: you guys rock!Congratulations to Gabor and Abderaman, winners of the last raffle.<\/p> <p>MegaHugs\u24c7 to Amelia, Hostess Etincelante,\u00a0inventor of a new game using French quotes.<\/p> <p>Come and get rewards\u00a0by:\u00a0<\/p> <p>1.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

In recent years, the advent of sophisticated computer technology has allowed studies of complex systems, in which large collections of components interact in nonlinear ways, such as cell colonies, neurons in the brain, the immune system, economic markets, and social groups.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThrough Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nWhat is Circling?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nCircling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

The reason why it is not discussed explicitly, is because Scrum is a framework that relies on self-organization and self-management, coming from within. As such, the role of Project Manager is not mandated to support internal dynamics of a single scrum team. But it does not mean that coordination and management, as a discipline are no longer required. \u00a0They are just handled differently.<\/p> <p><br\/>Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework is still Scrum. \u00a0It is scrum done by multiple teams, as they work on the same product (as oppose to multiple teams performing independent scrum activities). \u00a0The same guidelines apply to LeSS, as to basic scrum. \u00a0Of course, additional coordination between multiple teams might be needed. \u00a0With LeSS Huge framework, even more coordination might be required. \u00a0However, the role of Project Manager is still not mentioned explicitly.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, what kind of management and coordination is needed in basic Scrum?

The reason why it is not discussed explicitly, is because Scrum is a framework that relies on self-organization and self-management, coming from within. As such, the role of Project Manager is not mandated to support internal dynamics of a single scrum team. But it does not mean that coordination and management, as a discipline are no longer required. \u00a0They are just handled differently.<\/p> <p><br\/>Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework is still Scrum. \u00a0It is scrum done by multiple teams, as they work on the same product (as oppose to multiple teams performing independent scrum activities). \u00a0The same guidelines apply to LeSS, as to basic scrum. \u00a0Of course, additional coordination between multiple teams might be needed. \u00a0With LeSS Huge framework, even more coordination might be required. \u00a0However, the role of Project Manager is still not mentioned explicitly.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, what kind of management and coordination is needed in basic Scrum? Who is doing what? \u00a0How does this change with LeSS?

They explain that they come from other star systems, planets and dimensions and they function as a group when being channeled; they know Earth and have great knowledge about our planet and our people. They REFLECT back to us, what is our true nature, what is our authentic cosmic awareness, showing us how vast and great we really are. Their concern for the amount of destruction, war and pain we experience has motivated them with a clear agenda, to help us shift to a more expanded consciousness. They reach out to us with love, energy and light, as loving family. When we align together with them through the channeled session, they provide this reflection and thus activate great shifts in our perspective and awareness, but also in our very physical vibration, in the actual resonance of our cellular body. It is understood that when we resonate at a higher frequency, we are able to transmute fear and other disturbing emotions into peace and love, we are able to transcend the restrictions of time and space.<\/p> <p>In this intense 2 hour session, Suzy will connect us with our Pleidian brothers and sisters, and work to neutralize restrictive karma and any ancestral hooks and anchors that are holding us back, identify and alter emotional and mental broadcasts, and nullify all energies and entities that may be distinguishing our innate super hero powers in any way. Only if you are ready to go full steam ahead into relativity and complete your lessons of the 3D reality should you consider this intensive workshop.<\/p> <p>If you have seen the world of drama, suffering, pain and limitation enough times and do not choose-- from free will --to reenter the mouse wheel, we invite to the SYNCHRONICITY TEMPLE.

Apache Beam offers a simple, unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing while Scio brings it much closer to the high level API many data engineers are familiar with, e.g. Spark and Scalding. We will cover design and implementation of the framework, including features like type safe BigQuery macros, REPL, and serialization. There will also be some live coding demo.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Bio<\/b>: Neville is a software engineer at Spotify who works mainly on data infrastructure and tools for machine learning and advanced analytics. In the past few years he has been driving the adoption of Scala and new data tools for music recommendation, including Scalding, Spark, Storm and Parquet.

Rumors abound that Google will announce some sort of Android-on-the-desktop initiative, offering Android for desktop and notebook form factors. Even if Google doesn't announce anything at I|O, a move to have Android compete with Windows and OS X seems inevitable. This will have impacts on your app, to adapt to non-touchscreen displays, mice- and keyboard-centric user input, resizeable windows, and so on.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In this presentation, we will explore what what user expectations will be for desktop-style Android apps, how Android and your app might deal with those issues, and what else to watch out for with respect to any possible announcements in this space.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Liam Spradlin, \"Mutative Design: What it's like to use a mutative interface\"<\/b><br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mutative design is a new methodology that hopes to address the problems inherent in designing for averages. It looks to create interfaces and experiences that are born, live, and evolve according to a user's ongoing realities, providing a no-compromise design that accounts for every user, regardless of vision level, data access, physical ability, or even tech savvy. The first steps in thinking about and experimenting with this methodology were made with the introduction of Project Phoebe in December (hello.phoebe.xyz), and now it's time to take a look at Phoebe's latest steps.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In this talk we'll unpack what it's like to actually use and live with a mutative interface, how mutations may be automatically selected for using aggregated information about various user states, and how to ensure users feel comfortable with an interface that may change and grow as they do.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nA big thanks to our sponsor,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/careers.americanexpress.com\/tech\/\">The American Express Company<\/a>, and David for coordinating with us again.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/c\/6\/600_448359878.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/android-developers-nyc\/events\/229965822\/","yes_rsvp_count":199,"duration":9000000,"name":"May: Android on the Desktop, and the Latest on Project Phoebe","id":"229965822","time":1462919400000,"updated":1462938460000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1313621023000,"name":"New York Android Developers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":2357601,"urlname":"android-developers-nyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"150 W. 30th St. ","name":"Madison Square Tavern ","lon":-73.991943,"id":24236155,"state":"NY","lat":40.748047,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.169456481934,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461690568000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/6\/7\/600_443553895.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Why just paint when you can Tipsy Paint?

Together they will delve into the mimetic impulse in Yu Hua\u2019s fiction, exploring the realist dimension of this writer who has been studied primarily under the rubric of modernism, experimentation, and the avant-garde.<\/p> <p>Yu Hua is the author of five novels, six story collections, and three essay collections, including To Live, Brothers, and China in Ten Words. He is a Contributing Op-Ed Writer for the New York Times and his work has been translated into more than twenty languages. He is the recipient of many awards, including the James Joyce Award, France\u2019s Prix Courrier International, and Italy\u2019s Premio Grinzane Cavour.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/230883603\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvhbnb","time":1462919400000,"updated":1462932003000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nanuet","address_1":"119 Main St., 2nd Floor","name":"Rockland County Makerspace @CILK119","lon":-74.012962,"id":23685653,"state":"NY","lat":41.092907,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.7712497711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456583522000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Rockland County Makerspace offers weekly Arduino workshops with Dr. Duncan Bell, who has extensive experience in building many types of Arduino-based projects.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Bell will bring multiple types of Arduinos and shields, motors and lights, and even computers for the attendees to play with in a hands-on environment.

It explains the cycle of birth and death and is one of the most widely employed system for explaining causes and conditions.<\/p> <p>Here it is way simplified: (1) fundamental ignorance; (2) action; (3) consciousness; (4) name and form; (5) six sense organs; (6) contact; (7) sensation; (8) craving; (9) grasping; (10) coming into existence; (11) birth; (12) aging and death. Each step is a consequence of the preceding step, but many causes come together under various conditions to produce consequences (conditional arising and karmic results). There are explanations abound.<\/p> <p>The Heart Sutra summarizes the 12 Links as follows: - There is no ignorance - or ending of ignorance, - through to no aging and death - or ending of aging and death<\/p> <p>While ordinary people think of cutting off their pain and suffering but without cutting off their greed, aversions and delusions, Buddhadharma stresses the contemplation of understanding causes before the consequences. The Heart Sutra addresses the resolution of ending cycle of suffering, the 12 Links.<\/p> <p>Join us for a fun workshop taught by Venerable Guo Xing. This topic is major section of the Heart Sutra. While the sutra is one of the shortest and best known, the concepts are deep and that often requires many (and more) sessions to understand. If you are interested in this type of studies or have some background, this would be a beneficial workshop for you. It may not be for everyone. There is no cost to this workshop. If you want to donate you can donate to your charity of choice or Venerable GuoXing's center. -------<br\/>Venerable Guo Xing is the current Abbot of Chan Meditation Center in Queens NY and Dharma Drum Retreat Center in Upstate NY, part of Dharma Drum Mountain, an international Buddhist organization based in Taiwan. Venerable was ordained under Late Chan Master Shen Yen in 1986 and assisted the Master between 1987 and 2007 in leading meditation retreats in Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and the United States, totaling more than 50 retreats, including the first 49 day retreat at DDRC in 2000.

Attendees will learn how to automate the completion of human tasks (e.g. price research, image tagging, sentiment analysis, etc) with impressive speed, accuracy and scalability.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-rb\/events\/223864947\/","yes_rsvp_count":150,"duration":7200000,"name":"Crowdsourcing and Protocol Buffers","id":"ljjpglyvhbnb","time":1462921200000,"updated":1462935963000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1295408332000,"name":"NYC.rb","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1768544,"urlname":"NYC-rb","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Rubyists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1417325070000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>We'll be joined by\u00a0MANY WRITERS AND ACTORS NOT ENUMERATED HERE\u00a0for\u00a0an entertaining\u00a0and constructive 3-hour session\u00a0of\u00a0skillful cold readings\u00a0and open-forum comments\u00a0on the writing, adroitly moderated by\u00a0the dryly humorous Tom Thornton.<\/i> We'll be taking over the\u00a0space at 7:00 sharp,\u00a0and the\u00a0evening should be in full swing\u00a0by 7:10!\u00a0 (Latecomers\u00a0are still welcome, of course.)<\/p> <p>Writers,\u00a0if you're bringing something to present, don't forget to bring\u00a0ample COMPLETE and IDENTICAL\u00a0copies of\u00a0the scene(s)\u00a0--- one copy\u00a0for each actor you'll need, plus one copy for a reader of any stage directions.\u00a0 (And\u00a0if you're able to provide\u00a0character descriptions\u00a0in the form of a\u00a0breakdown appended as\u00a0page 1 --- that's\u00a0never a bad\u00a0idea. :))<\/p> <p>Actors, come ready to read!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WeeklyPlaywrightsWorkshop\/events\/230884677\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"playwrights' workshop (w\/ actors \"reading\")","id":"gjxvclyvhbnb","time":1462921200000,"updated":1462933563000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1398960423000,"name":"Weekly Playwrights' Workshop (w\/ actors \"reading\")","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":14213992,"urlname":"WeeklyPlaywrightsWorkshop","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"people \"on here\" (+ others)"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"321 East 73rd Street (between 1st & 2nd Ave)","name":"Bohemian National Hall","lon":-73.957268,"id":17623542,"state":"NY","lat":40.769276,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.17416286469,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461079739000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This film is part of the\u00a0<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingimage.us\/programs\/2016\/05\/06\/detail\/panorama-europe-2016\/\">Panorama Europe 2016<\/a><\/i>\u00a0series at MOMI:<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S_hGdGKAkv8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S_hGdGKAkv8<\/a><\/p> <p><b>New York Premiere\u00a0with director Jo\u00e3o Botelho in person<\/b><\/p> <p>Portugal\/Brazil.

Some of us \"trash talk\" when we play, but it's all in good fun &amp; in the spirit of gaming.<\/p> <p>- This is a restaurant\/bar so accidents are bound to happen. However, if you're responsible for ruining someone else's game by spilling a beverage or food on it, the right thing to do is to offer to purchase a new copy for them. Some of the games we bring are out of print so please treat every board game with respect.<\/p> <p>- If a game is accidentally ruined by a staff member, everyone at the table should pitch in to buy a new one for the owner. More often than not, this comes to about $10\/person or less, so in our opinion it isn't too much to ask for.<\/p> <p>Thanks everyone &amp; see you on Tuesday night!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers\/events\/230686203\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Weekly Game Night at TGIF","id":"xpqtmlyvhbnb","time":1462921200000,"updated":1462936273000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355802481000,"name":"Forest Hills Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":6280132,"urlname":"Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Board Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"21 East 1st Street, New York, NY","name":"The Alchemist's Kitchen","lon":-73.991226,"id":24302446,"state":"NY","lat":40.724201,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.78748106956,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461259704000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Celebrate the beginning of Spring, a time of expansion and creativity as you practice Kundalini mantra and meditation to awaken your spirit and merge with the infinite.<br\/>Enjoy the healing vibrations of a gong \u201csound bath\u201d by Rita London to experience profound cleansing, relaxation and renewal.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

The money will be directed toward micro-relief efforts organized by a friend of Kampai! and Izakaya Hunders, Sansyo Nakamura, a well-known roku-go performer in Kumamoto.

When the group was in Boston, the members all pledged to write something ambitious and potentially life changing, and that was such a rewarding experience.

Also, if you do a Google search for \"Seven At The Sevens,\" it's the first item that pops up! While there, you can also find our NPR interview about the book. Although we ended up publishing a book, the group\u2019s main mission was about keeping each other\u2019s writing going and on track, and holding each writer accountable to his\/her own self-imposed but ambitious goals. The main purpose of WritersAnonymous.org was\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0about publishing a book or to have each other\u2019s writings critiqued, although that can and did happen.<\/p> <p>Further, WritersAnonymous is about being inspired by your peers and inspiring others to find their own voices. It is about connecting with people who have a similar passion in life and who may understand you a little better because they have the same burning desire to tell a story in whatever written form it may emerge. It is also about forging new and lasting friendships in a supportive and encouraging environment during the often lonely and difficult creative writing process.<\/p> <p>So, want to write and create something worthwhile, and also equally help others in their literary journeys?

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

It's an unfair fight because companies have more people, money, information and\u00a0 other resources. This leads to mistrust and mistakes.\u00a0 Decision Fish\u2019s mission is to help people make better financial decisions step-by-step with simple and independent online decision support tools that leverage the founder's experience and techniques from his\u00a026-year Wall Street career.

This leads to mistrust and mistakes.\u00a0 Decision Fish\u2019s mission is to help people make better financial decisions step-by-step with simple and independent online decision support tools that leverage the founder's experience and techniques from his\u00a026-year Wall Street career.

Along the way, we will look at many common tools of Technical Analysis such as Fibonacci ratios, moving averages, and some indicators, and we will see that they do not work as many people assume\u2014and that too many times, traders struggle with tools that simply do not work. Adam will demonstrate that the fundamental forces that shape prices, and will show how a few simple patterns can tilt the probabilities in your favor.

Virbio allows clinicians to virtually preview the cells or blood vessels, prior to surgically cutting the biopsy tissue to (1) reduce number of biopsies, and (2) hone in on where to biopsy. For Barrett's esophagus and colon polyps, too many biopsies are currently performed. Virbio was developed using off-the-shelf components. It's a presumed class 2 medical device and we are working with Dr. Michael Drues (President, Vascular Sciences) to create a regulatory strategy. It contains both hardware and software components, and will be integrated into an ergonomic medical cart. We have a letter of intent to perform early clinical trials, and there are already CPT codes in place for esophagoscopies with optical biopsies.<\/p> <p>NanoTechGalaxy creates the software to assist radiologists reduce time to diagnosis for each medical image. 37% of the profit of hospitals cames from radiology departments but the cognitive load of radiologists is overwhelming. We create the tools to reduce the cognitive load and optimise the workflow of radiology departments. We use deep learning which is state of the art technology in machine learning used by Google and Facebook for machine vision.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>8:00pm \u00a0\u00a0From Nothing to Something.\u00a0 What are the beginning steps in any company\u2019s nascent period, Part II?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Idea\/concept development\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time for lawyers\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Research &amp; development\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Market testing\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What about investors?<\/p> <p><b>8:45pm \u00a0 \u00a0 Networking<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Society-of-Physician-Entrepreneurs-SoPE-New-York-TriState\/events\/230178081\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"duration":10800000,"name":"Meeting of the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs, NY TriState Chapter","id":"230178081","time":1463004000000,"updated":1463061465000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360348093000,"name":"Society of Physician Entrepreneurs (SoPE): New York TriState","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":7091292,"urlname":"Society-of-Physician-Entrepreneurs-SoPE-New-York-TriState","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"SoPE"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1412 Broadway, 22 Floor","name":"Grind Broadway","lon":-73.986649,"id":14241652,"state":"NY","lat":40.753639,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":17,"headcount":0,"distance":0.306953161955,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460226147000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>First Speakers: Decision Fish: Scalable Decision Support Tools for Consumers<\/b><\/p> <p>Join us for an interactive discussion about financial decision making.

It's an unfair fight because companies have more people, money, information and\u00a0 other resources. This leads to mistrust and mistakes.\u00a0 Decision Fish\u2019s mission is to help people make better financial decisions step-by-step with simple and independent online decision support tools that leverage the founder's experience and techniques from his\u00a026-year Wall Street career.

Today people are leveraging it for aggregating data, powering dashboards, even building knowledge graphs. As the underlying data manipulation has become more robust, now we need better ways of working with that data then just the browser based query. This talk is going to cover one of the new ways of interaction with Solr, using Spark. We\u2019ll go through how to make Solr be a RDD: Resilient Distributed Dataset, and do some Spark jobs. I\u2019ll mention some of the use cases for Spark, ranging from \u201ccomparing data sets\u201d to \u201ccalculating average reading level of text\u201d.<\/p> <p>Lastly, we\u2019ll look at Apache Zeppelin, which aims to be the \u201cinteractive data analytics notebook\u201d of the Big Data world. We\u2019ll use Zeppelin to play with some data in Solr.<\/p> <p>Bio<br\/>Fascinated by the \u201ccraft\u201d of software development, Eric Pugh has been heavily involved in the open source world as a developer, committer, and user for the past 10 years. He is a member of the Apache Software Foundation and lately has been mulling over how we move our expectations for search from \u201c10 blue links\u201d to \u201cremarkably right\u201d. In biotech, financial services and defense IT, he has helped European and American companies develop coherent strategies for embracing open source software. As a speaker he has advocated the advantages of Agile practices in software development. Eric became involved in Solr in 2007 when he submitted SOLR-284, the patch for Parsing Rich Documents such as PDF and MS Office, which subsequently became the single most popular patch as measured by community votes! The patch was subsequently cleaned up and enhanced by three other individuals, demonstrating the power of the Free\/Open Source Model to build great code collaboratively. SOLR-284 was eventually refactored into Solr Cell as part of Solr version 1.4. Eric co-authored \"Solr Enterprise Search Server\", the first book on Solr.

Using a unique dataset of 888 algorithmic trading strategies developed and backtested on the Quantopian platform with at least 6 months of out-of-sample performance, we study the prevalence and impact of backtest overfitting. Specifically, we find that commonly reported backtest evaluation metrics like the Sharpe ratio offer little value in predicting out of sample performance (R\u00b2 &lt; 0.025). However, we show that by training a Random Forest regressor on a variety of features that describe backtest behavior, out-of-sample performance can be predicted at a much higher accuracy (R\u00b2 = 0.17) on hold-out data compared to using linear, univariate features. We then show that we can construct a multi-strategy portfolio based on predictions by the Random Forest which performed significantly better out-of-sample than other alternatives.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker:\u00a0<\/b>Thomas Wiecki is the Data Science Lead at Quantopian focusing Bayesian models to evaluate trading algorithms.

Clarke\u2019s<\/a><\/p> <p>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS: 1868 \u2013 1912<\/p> <p>While much of P.J. Clarke\u2019s history has been extraordinarily preserved, the earliest days of the legendary bar are somewhat murky. What\u00a0is\u00a0known is that the little red brick building was constructed in 1868 for unstated purposes on a squalid patch of land labeled in city records simply as \u201csquatters\u2019 shacks.\u201d Sometime in 1884, the building was converted to a watering hole by one \u201cMr. Jennings,\u201d who saw an opportunity to serve the many Irish laborers travelling to and from their jobs at the neighborhood\u2019s slaughterhouses, breweries, manufactories, tanneries, and construction sites.<\/p> <p>P.J. Clarke\u2019s didn\u2019t gain its current name until another Irish immigrant, Mr. Patrick Joseph \u201cPaddy\u201d Clarke, arrived in the neighborhood around 1902 as the newly hired bartender under the saloon\u2019s second owner, the Englishman \u201cMr. Duneen.\u201d (What became of the first owner, Mr. Jennings, or when exactly the bar transferred ownership to Mr. Duneen is unknown. As is, for that matter, either Mr. Jennings\u2019 or Mr. Duneen\u2019s first names.) An industrious and apparently thrifty lad, Paddy tended bar and more or less ran the saloon for ten years before saving enough to purchase it outright from Mr. Duneen in 1912.<\/p> <p>THE MAKINGS OF A LEGEND: 1912 \u2013 1948<\/p> <p>All around the little red brick bar, momentous changes began taking place in the neighborhood. Slaughterhouses were relocated to the outer boroughs. Luxury apartments were built along Avenue A. Tenements were razed to clear space for middle-class apartments. And a few blocks west, the massive Rockefeller Plaza was constructed, bringing with it a wave of office workers, publishers, news reporters, and media moguls.<\/p> <p>In the face of this cultural and economic upheaval, P.J.\u2019s remained stubbornly, defiantly, and proudly the same. Despite this \u2013 or more likely because of it \u2013\u00a0the bar thrived. Even Prohibition produced barely a hiccup, as P.J.\u2019s used its discreet \u201cwives\u2019 window\u201d (where women and children would come to fill pails of beer, women being prohibited from entering the bar until the \u201960s) to screen customers and give neighborly handouts to cops on the local beat.<\/p> <p>Sometime in the 1940s, P.J.\u2019s \u2013 already a local institution \u2013 was discovered by the celebrity set. A fresh-faced Frank Sinatra ended many of his nights at table #20. Singer Johnny Mercer penned \u201cOne for My Baby\u201d on a napkin while sitting at the antique mahogany bar. Charles Jackson, writer of the classic book\u00a0The Lost Weekend, was a regular, and the bar scenes from Academy Award-winning movie adaptation were shot there. And so the legend grew.<\/p> <p>STANDING TALL AMONG GIANTS: 1948 \u2013 2000<\/p> <p>Patrick Joseph and his family ran P.J. Clarke\u2019s until 1948, at which point it was sold to their upstairs neighbors the Lavezzos \u2013 antique dealers and restorers who ran their business out of the second floor. At the time, the Lavezzos also bought the red brick building itself for the princely sum of $19,000 \u2013 a decision that would prove critical with the coming skyscraper boom of the 1950s.<\/p> <p>When the noisy, dilapidated Third Avenue El was torn down in 1955, the world around P.J. Clarke\u2019s changed yet again. Real estate prices took off. Skyrocketing rents forced out small businesses. And skyscrapers jumped up all around the little brick building. Despite intense pressure from developers and the obvious lure of financial riches, the Lavezzos refused to sell. Finally, in 1967, the family negotiated a 99-year lease with a developer, securing the future of the bar. In the words of\u00a0The New York Times, it was \u201cDavid who prevailed over Goliath.\u201d<\/p> <p>Over the next decades, the city continued to change around P.J.\u2019s, and P.J.\u2019s continued to stay exactly the same, serving a loyal mix of locals, laborers, office workers, and celebrities. Buddy Holly proposed to his wife there. Elizabeth Taylor loved to stop by late. Richard Harris was known for his promethean appetite for double vodkas.\u00a0Jackie Kennedy would stop by with her young son, John Jr. And Nat King Cole declared the cheeseburgers to be \u201cThe Cadillac of Burgers,\u201d establishing the name of what would become P.J. Clarke\u2019s signature dish.<\/p> <p>TODAY<\/p> <p>In the early 2000s, P.J. Clarke\u2019s, along with the rest of the city, suffered with the economic downturn. After a period of uncertainty, it was purchased in 2002 by Arnold Penner, restaurateur Philip Scotti, and a group of investors, including George Steinbrenner and Timothy Hutton. Of course, the regulars were understandably nervous about what a change in ownership might bring and their fears seemed confirmed when it was closed suddenly for \u201crenovations.\u201d But when the bar reopened, they found that aside from a much-needed cleaning and improvements to the building\u2019s infrastructure, everything was exactly as it was before, down to the very last detail. At the grand reopening, the patrons lined up around the block, and stood four-deep at the mahogany bar.<\/p> <p>P.J. Clarke\u2019s was back. Better than ever. And the same as it ever was.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewYorkAdventureClub\/events\/230847899\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Adventure Club \u2018Oldest Bars In NYC\u2019 Happy Hour Series","id":"230847899","time":1463005800000,"updated":1463017986000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398126302000,"name":"New York Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":14035072,"urlname":"NewYorkAdventureClub","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Non-Boring Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":80,"headcount":0,"distance":0.868552923203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":33,"created":1459453721000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be having our next meetup on May 11th at Oscar Health!

Statistical modeling is rooted in parsimony, significance and model interpretation. Machine Learning (ML) models are prolific in their data usage and are generally opaque to human interpretation which makes them unsuited to many financial tasks. Machine learning algorithms can make use of large datasets with millions of features (independent variables) and billions of rows of data.\u00a0 This allows for the use of very large and sparse datasets to create accurate predictions at the expense of simplicity and interpretability.<\/p> <p>In this talk we will investigate the application of machine learning techniques to produce valuation estimates for single family residences (SFR). Single family residences are a $25 trillion asset class in the U.S. representing approximately 120 million properties. This asset class also underpins the the $12 trillion mortgage backed securities market. We will see how machine learning models are well suited to this domain. We will examine a sample data set and build prediction algorithms along with calculating accuracy measures and compare them to the corresponding Zestimate from Zillow.<\/p> <p><b>Bios<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Ritesh Bansal<\/b> has worked for over 18 years in the financial industry.

It's a game complete with spies, government corruption, and (obviously) a resistance.<\/p> <p>Each game lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia\/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.<\/p> <p>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players\u2019 identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself\/herself).

and a Vermentino, widely grown in northwest Italy and southern France (where it is called Rolle).\u00a0 A well-priced Cabernet.\u00a0 An Aglianico that evokes southern Italy in California.\u00a0 And wines from three major producers: a Turley Zinfandel, made from one of the oldest Zinfandel vineyards in California; a classic Rh\u00f4ne-style red blend by Tablas Creek, which was founded by the Perrin family of Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape fame; and a hybrid Rh\u00f4ne\/Bordeaux-style blend (combining Syrah with Cabernet and Petit Verdot) by L\u2019Aventure, founded by a French winemaker who felt too limited by French AOC laws and now makes some of the best wines on the Central Coast.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be returning to Plates in Larchmont, which encourages BYOB on Wednesday.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/platesonthepark.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2013 Sans Liege C\u00f4tes du Coast\u00a0 $30\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 A smoking blend of 49% Viognier, 27% Roussanne, 15% Grenache Blanc and the rest Marsanne, the 2013 C\u00f4tes du Coast offers terrific richness and depth in its lemon curd, buttered citrus and honeycomb-styled bouquet. Medium to full-bodied and voluptuous on the palate, it nevertheless stays nicely focused and clean, with notable purity and freshness on the finish. Aged 18 months in 20% new French oak (with some in stainless steel), it's a food-friendly, beautifully made white that's well worth a multi-bottle purchase.<\/p> <p><b>2014 Giornata Wines Vermentino\u00a0 $24\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16\/20<\/i> \u2013 Whole-cluster pressed. All stainless-steel tank and drum. Ambient yeast. Fresh, spiced aromatics. Notes of mixed tropical fruit with no sweetness, light wax and pepper accents. Spry, lively and serious. Nice focus with a sense of richness without heaviness.<\/p> <p><b>2014 Daou Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon\u00a0 $24\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91-93<\/i> \u2013 The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon is loaded with notions of black raspberry, cassis, spice and licorice. More textured, voluptuous, layered and concentrated than all of the previous vintages, it will have an easy 10-15 years of longevity.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Ryme Cellars Aglianico Luna Matta Vineyard\u00a0 $42\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17\/20 \u2013 <\/i>Delicious perfumed and dark fruit palate with a sense of freshness and lightness accented by gunmetal and iron. Grippy, slightly tenacious tannin characteristic of the variety that becomes supple alongside food. This is a wine meant to be enjoyed with a meal. Nicely executed.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Turley Wine Cellars Zinfandel Ueberroth Vineyard\u00a0 $49\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 95<\/i> \u2013 Consistently spectacular in the capable, meticulous winemaking hands at Turley Cellars, the 2013 Zinfandel Ueberroth Vineyard comes from one of the oldest Zinfandel vineyards in California (planted in 1885). The ungrafted, head-trained vines from steep limestone slopes just down the road from Justin Smith\u2019s Saxum Winery have produced a monster and a fascinating Zinfandel in 2013. Coming in at 15.8% alcohol, the wine displays deep black raspberry and black cherry fruit, hints of crushed rock, and fresh acidity that is no doubt attributable to the pH of the limestone soils. The wine, in spite of its relatively lofty alcohol, comes across as remarkably elegant, concentrated, and stunningly proportioned. This full-bodied tour de force in Zinfandel winemaking should drink well for a decade or more.<\/p> <p><b>2011 L'Aventure Winery Optimus\u00a0 $50\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Optimus is a rocking value that gives more than a glimpse into the style and quality of this estate. A blend of 50% Syrah, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Petit Verdot and spending 14 months in 70% new French oak, it delivers fantastic black and blue fruits, tobacco, violets and cedar aromas and flavors to go with a full-bodied, supple and beautifully polished mouthfeel that stays fresh and lively. Gorgeous all around, it will drink nicely through 2021, if not longer. Drink now-2021.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Tablas Creek Esprit de Tablas\u00a0 $58\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>A Galloni 93-95<\/i> \u2013 A big, explosive wine, the 2012 Esprit de Tablas is warm and ample on the palate, very much in the style of the year, yet there is plenty of power lying in reserve. In 2012, Syrah plays a larger role than in both the 2010 and 2011, which is felt in the wine\u2019s broad, expansive personality. This is going to be a fascinating Esprit to follow over the coming years.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 Made from 40% Mourvedre, 30% Syrah, 21% Grenache and the balance Counoise, the 2012 Esprit de Tablas is an elegant, supple and medium to full-bodied red that excels on is lively pure texture and overall elegant personality. Revealing perfumed notes of sweet cherries, black raspberries, ground herbs and underbrush, this moderately concentrated, balanced and overall pretty Paso Robles red will evolve nicely through 2022.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group\/events\/230714484\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Paso Robles","id":"230714484","time":1463007600000,"updated":1463020995000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403902580000,"name":"Westchester BYOB Wine Tasting Group","group_lon":-73.8600006104,"id":15362102,"urlname":"Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group","group_lat":41.0800018311,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wayne","address_1":"170 Colfax Rd","name":"Wayne Racquet Club","lon":-74.265884,"id":19966552,"lat":40.977711,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":16,"distance":21.3823680878,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460294872000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/9\/0\/600_378874192.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>For BEGINNERS thru INTERMEDIATES<\/p> <p><br\/>1st HOUR - GROUP LESSON by our USPTA Professional<br\/>2nd++ HOUR - OPEN PLAY among participants<\/p> <p>$25 for non-members \u00a0 \u00a0<b>$5 for members of WRC<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Wayne-Tennis-Meetup-Group\/events\/230265937\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":9000000,"name":"GROUP LESSON & OPEN PLAY on WEDNESDAY NITE @ WRC","id":"dqzjslyvhbpb","time":1463007600000,"updated":1463059394000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1399583117000,"name":"The Wayne Tennis Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.25,"id":14342912,"urlname":"The-Wayne-Tennis-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"446 Rogers Avenue","name":"PELS Pie Co.","lon":-73.953941,"id":24160645,"state":"NY","lat":40.661652,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.40279531479,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461555209000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey team:<\/p> <p>\n\nIt was great getting together to discuss Chapter 1!

If your parents were not loved unconditionally, they each developed an inner child which felt unloved. This made it hard for your parents to love you the way you wanted and needed to be loved. When you were not loved unconditionally, you too developed an inner child which felt unloved.<\/p> <p>Your needy inner child, which feels unloved, is locked into the past. It feels that the past has been difficult and painful and is afraid that the future will be the same way. It is afraid and doesn\u2019t feel worthy.<\/p> <p>The thoughts and beliefs of your needy inner child are based on fear, hurt and remorse. There are thoughts of self-recrimination and replaying of old programs of parental disapproval, which now manifest as self-judgment. The underlying message of your needy inner child is, \u201cLife is a struggle.\" Your needy inner child believes it is a victim of the world and carries an underlying feeling of hopelessness and helplessness.<\/p> <p>The way out of this needy inner child rut is first to gain a sense of detachment, which allows you to observe your needy inner child\u2019s thought system in action. Whenever there is a feeling of fear or tension in your body, you can know that there is an underlying attachment or identification with a needy inner child belief system.<\/p> <p>The first step towards healing your needy inner child is through non-judgmental observing. Observing with non-judgment and love allows you the freedom, detachment and the perspective which fosters deep healing. As you learn to be compassionate and understanding of your inner child, the journey to healing begins. If this is done consistently, the needy inner child begins to feel safe and eventually sees a new direction. As you continue this path of observing your needy inner child with love, a sense of hope that the past need not be repeated begins to emerge and a transformation occurs. You will feel more relaxed and will have a sense of trust that you are safe and loved.<\/p> <p>In this 8-week Healing Inner Child Program that is guided by a trained facilitator, you will learn how to give your needy inner child the nurturing attention it has always wanted. As you participate in the Healing Inner Child Program, you will learn to pay attention to what your needy inner child says, thinks, feels and how it behaves. You will learn to observe it with detachment and compassion, realizing you can transform and heal it with the help of your Higher Self.<\/p> <p>In the supportive environment of a group or one on one, you will learn that you are not alone and have a choice to perceive your situation differently. The shared experiences and activities provide a rich opportunity to release limiting fears and bring more unconditional love into your life.<\/p> <p>Included is a workbook with eight lessons that can be a journal of your inner child healing. Weekly focus cards and a guided audio meditation (a male &amp; female voice version) will help you bring your inner child issues to your Higher Self for transformation.

John Bellone currently runs the Platform Engineering team @ Bloomberg and was tasked with rolling Chef out globally within all aspects of the Bloomberg infrastructure. As you can imagine rolling out to a company of this size you will need a ton of standards and best practices on how\/what\/who cookbooks should be doing and looking in the environment. During this talk John will dive through his process for proper Chef Cookbook Development and how he is training all of the members of the Bloomberg org on howto use Chef. John is also a avid contributor to OSS projects but most recently has been spending a large amount of time making reusable cookbooks for the world to consume. You can view some of John's work at github.com\/bloomberg and github.com\/johnbellone. Please be sure to stop by and give a listen to his talk. Plus its on hump day and we have free food and beer.

Then, the second thing that you're going to need is some way to process all that data. Enter Apache Spark, the biggest thing to happen to big data since Hadoop MapReduce. With Spark, its machine learning libraries, and related projects, you can learn machine learning models over arbitrarily-sized datasets.<\/p> <p><br\/>This talk will be a technical exploration of different aspects of building a large scale machine learning system like an intelligent agent. The focus will be on using Spark and related tools to build machine learning systems that stay responsive in the face of errors or changes in scale. These sorts of considerations are crucial for any team looking to build an agent who is expected to be always available and always learning. You can build just a truly reactive system to support an intelligent agent. This talk will show you how to do so by harnessing the power of Apache Spark and other important open source libraries.<\/p> <p><b>Keynote Speaker Bio:<\/b>\u00a0Jeff Smith builds large-scale machine learning systems using Scala and Spark. For the past decade, he has been working on data science applications at various startups in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong.

Her bestselling novels, including Olive Kitteridge and The Burgess Boys, have illuminated our most tender relationships. Now, in My Name Is Lucy Barton, this extraordinary writer shows how a simple hospital visit becomes a portal to the most tender relationship of all\u2014the one between mother and daughter.<\/p> <p>Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn\u2019t spoken for many years, comes to see her. Gentle gossip about people from Lucy\u2019s childhood in Amgash, Illinois, seems to reconnect them, but just below the surface lie the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of Lucy\u2019s life: her escape from her troubled family, her desire to become a writer, her marriage, her love for her two daughters. Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable.<\/p> <p>The NYT Sunday Book Review also wrote about the book in January: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/10\/books\/review\/elizabeth-strouts-my-name-is-lucy-barton.html?_r=0\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/10\/books\/review\/elizabeth-strouts-my-name-is-lucy-barton.html?_r=0<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Welcome-Club\/events\/229505244\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"April Book Club","id":"229505244","time":1463009400000,"updated":1463511597000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1388458393000,"name":"Westfield Welcome Club","group_lon":-74.3499984741,"id":11635212,"urlname":"Westfield-Welcome-Club","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Moms, Wives, Women, Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"East Orange","address_1":"356 Glenwood Avenue, Studio 301","name":"The Art Garage","lon":-74.210205,"id":24266177,"state":"NJ","lat":40.779724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.7289876938,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451512076000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Gesture Drawing for Animators!

We are here to put on a great show with credited comics and leave you wanting to comeback for more. We know life is hard and for few hours we want you to forget and just laugh away.
