The lesion's nutrition is restricted by the liquid, which causes the circulation to constrict. A scab forms in a few days, then drops off in a few weeks, leaving esthetically pleasing skin. The best results are achieved with growths on the face (any size!). Mild de-pigmentation may occasionally occur on the arms, legs, &amp; torso, especially when melanin-containing or cancer-prone flat areas are treated. Any deeper layer of pigment that might remain (a rare occurrence) can be safely retreated, as no blood vessels are penetrated.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/5AOf9h7w_j1PhM0s6Swpwg3AH0ry4AJ9Q0iuY4INsAMoqyTUdfOsyh9wphs3QZSHcFeIr0dQvdjogYmLg-iQGrp2qq5BCyT-LhWojR0D7L93o5O11li8nNaNb1JVOLtBoZsqx02h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/5AOf9h7w_j1PhM0s6Swpwg3AH0ry4AJ9Q0iuY4INsAMoqyTUdfOsyh9wphs3QZSHcFeIr0dQvdjogYmLg-iQGrp2qq5BCyT-LhWojR0D7L93o5O11li8nNaNb1JVOLtBoZsqx02h<\/a><\/p> <p>About \"Dr. T\": \u00a0Prof. Adiel Tel-Oren, MD (Europe), CCN, DACBN, LN, DC (ret.), DABFM, DABOM, FABDA, DABCT (c) NON-SURGICAL<\/p> <p>Dr. T is a renowned holistic scientist, author, innovator, and educator, consulting for medical laboratories and professional medical product manufacturers, formulating new products, designing Green Buildings, and lecturing to doctors and the public worldwide on Natural Principles, Health, Medicine, Nutrition, and Sustainability.<\/p> <p>He is a licensed European Medical Doctor (trained in Europe and in the USA), a US-licensed, Board-Certified Nutritionist and professor with the International &amp; American Association of Clinical Nutritionists, and board-certified by the American Board of Functional Medicine, Boards of Oxidative Medicine and Chelation Therapy, Clinical Board of Nutrition, and the American Board of Disability Analysts, and a Doctor of Chiropractic - retired from active US practice in 2001.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The traditional salesman (and yes, he was a man) has gone the way of the switchboard operator and the travel agent. The information monopoly that sellers of all types used to have is gone. But the information revolution has also given rise to a vast range of what Pink calls \u201cbantamweight entrepreneurs\u201d \u2013 from app developers to someone pickling and selling artisanal vegetables in Brooklyn.<\/p> <p>In this meeting, Steve will talk us through the new ABCs of sales: Attunement, Buoyancy, Clarity; and then we will all engage in a series of interactive exercises being used by CEOs and other corporate leaders to train themselves and their sales teams. We will end with an open discussion of Daniel Pink\u2019s approach and how it can help us improve our selling.<\/p> <p><br\/>The cost is $50 for members and first time attendees. All others are $55.

It's the go-to hardware for heavy-duty developers across the planet. But there's one area where PC hardware remains unsurpassed by Apple: keyboards. The Apple keyboard is notoriously bad from an ergonomics perspective, as my experience using Emacs on various MacBook Pro laptops attests. Many solutions are suggested for the Emacs diehard on Apple short keyboards, but none that I found were satisfactory.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226355284\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlytpbvb","time":1447718400000,"updated":1447863214000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brookline","address_1":"872 Commonwealth Ave","name":"7-Eleven ","lon":-71.114693,"id":22976962,"state":"MA","lat":42.350853,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.3728518486,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440421990000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Luke continues the story of the Lord in the Book of the \"Acts\" of the Apostles. \u00a0The cross isn't the end of the story--the resurrection is really the beginning! \u00a0Join us for an exciting study of what the Lord does next in the newly established Kingdom of God.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The study will be located in the upper level dining area in the BU West Campus 7-Evelen","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Bible-Study\/events\/226150847\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Study Acts","id":"smmfklytpbvb","time":1447718400000,"updated":1447731210000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1349362969000,"name":"Boston Bible Study","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":5239222,"urlname":"Boston-Bible-Study","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"763 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 7","name":"The Breathing Room","lon":-71.105568,"id":8576222,"state":"MA","lat":42.366524,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":1.87491583824,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435871761000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a weekly meeting where pregnant women and couples come to gain new insights about childbirth choices and issues that affect pregnancy and overall health. \u00a0Hear from birth experts ranging from midwives and doulas to registered nurses, educators and holistic healthcare practitioners.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/226356271\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytpbvb","time":1447720200000,"updated":1447777627000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"160 Boylston Street","name":"Engagement Game Lab","lon":-71.066681,"id":16472702,"state":"MA","lat":42.352264,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":0.561718583107,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423185075000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Interested in indie board game development?

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We know that many of our members want to avoid purchasing GMOs because of related threats to biodiversity and pollinator species, so we hope you will join us and be there for the bees!<\/p> <p>************<br\/>Whether or not you can attend in person, please submit written testimony to the committee by emailing the committee staffers: [masked] and [masked]<br\/>************<br\/>************<br\/>Please also contact your own Representative and ask them to also submit testimony in favor of this commonsense legislation: people who use neonicitinoid pesticides should be trained on how to use them! <a href=\"https:\/\/malegislature.gov\/People\/Search\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/malegislature.gov\/People\/Search<\/a><br\/>************<\/p> <p>Background: Neonicotinoid pesticides act on the nervous system of invertebrates and when improperly used, can result in lethal impacts to bees and other pollinators. Sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoids have also been cited as a possible contributing factor to Colony Collapse Disorder which has caused the death of millions of bees globally since 2006. In the U.S., neonicotinoids are currently used on about 95 percent of corn and canola crops; the majority of cotton, sorghum, and sugar beets; and about half of all soybeans. They are also used on the vast majority of fruit and vegetable crops, and are also applied to cereal grains, rice, nuts, and wine grapes.<\/p> <p>What the proposed legislation (H. 655 -An Act to Protect Massachusetts Pollinators) does:<\/p> <p>Limits the use of neonicotinoid pesticides to those properly trained to use them. Prohibits use for cosmetic purposes during the blooming when pollinators are most likely to be impacted.<\/p> <p>Requires notification of property owners before neonicotinoids can be applied and requires an alternative to be offered. Requires labeling of blooming and flowering plants with information about toxicity to bees.<\/p> <p><br\/>Read the full details of the bill on the MA State Legislature Website: <a href=\"https:\/\/malegislature.gov\/Bills\/189\/House\/H655\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/malegislature.gov\/Bills\/189\/House\/H655<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonBeekeepers\/events\/226599824\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Public Hearing: Pollinator Protection Act","id":"226599824","time":1447783200000,"updated":1447794950000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1264443262000,"name":"Boston Area Beekeepers Association (BABA)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1588475,"urlname":"BostonBeekeepers","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Bee Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.70568823814,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413592395000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Advanced players only.

Dr. Kolb's Negotiating at Work offers cogent and accessible advice on how to negotiate effectively, focusing on how to use negotiation strategy to increase opportunities, flexibility, and support in the work space. This road map specifically highlights the barriers to success women face and how women can navigate and overcome these barriers through effective negotiation skills.<\/p> <p>Seen as a significant contribution to the current literature on workplace negotiations, Negotiating at Work has received praise from authors and executives alike. William Ury, author of Getting to Yes and The Power of a Positive No applauds the book, saying it is a \"practical and insightful guide to negotiations at work...tak[ing&gt; on the longstanding and critical issue of women's leadership, creating the possibility of a win not only for the individual leader but also for the entire organization. Readers, both women and men, will find themselves better equipped to introduce positive change in the workplace.\"<\/p> <p>Echoing Ury's sentiments, fellow author and editor Marshall Goldsmith stated, \"Dr. Kolb has an uncommon understanding of what it means to negotiate well. Her win\u00c2\u2013win\u00c2\u2013win approach detailed in Negotiating at Work has the power to be an immediate game\u00c2\u2013changer for women and the companies they work for.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p>Deborah Kolb is Deloitte Ellen Gabriel Professor for Women in Leadership (Emerita) and the co-founder of Center for Gender in Organizations at the Simmons College School of Management. From[masked], Kolb was Executive Director of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. She is currently a Senior Fellow at the Program on Negotiation, where she co-directs the Negotiations in the Workplace Project.<\/p> <p>Professor Kolb is an authority on gender issues in negotiation and leadership. Her new book, Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins into Big Gains, was named one of the best negotiation books of the year by Time.com<\/p> <p>In addition to the many papers she has written on the topic, she has co-authored The Shadow Negotiation, named by Harvard Business Review one of the ten best business books of 2000, Everyday Negotiation: Navigating the Hidden Agendas of Bargaining, and Her Place at the Table: A Women\u00c2\u2019s Guide to Negotiating the Five Challenges of Leadership Success. In addition to her research, Kolb organizes and leads executive development programs for senior women and serves as a consultant to organizations interested in retaining and advancing their best women.<\/p> <p>Deborah Kolb received her Ph.D. from MIT\u00c2\u2019s Sloan School of Management, where her dissertation won the Zannetos Prize for outstanding doctoral scholarship.

Because this book has been sitting on my shelf for three years begging to be read, let's start with Malcolm Gladwell's Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.<\/p> <p>Here's a description:<\/p> <p>\"In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<\/p> <p>In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.\"<\/p> <p>You can find it on Amazon for $13:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blink-The-Power-Thinking-Without\/dp\/0316010669\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blink-The-Power-Thinking-Without\/dp\/0316010669<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Book-Club\/events\/226272898\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Malcolm Gladwell's Blink","id":"226272898","time":1447801200000,"updated":1447964775000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445656852000,"name":"Boston Book Club for 20\/30-Something Creatives","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":19055709,"urlname":"Boston-Book-Club","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Creatives"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center - 4th Floor Longfellow","name":"Microsoft Technology Center","lon":-71.109734,"id":9771072,"state":"MA","lat":42.373615,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.24069142342,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446913430000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>[Partner group\u00a0event] ENET <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-IEEE-Entrepreneurs-Network\/events\/225679540\/\">Boston Entrepreneurs' Network<\/a> presents Seed &amp; Angel Financing.<\/p> <p><b>Event Description:<\/b><\/p> <p>Discover how Angel and Seed investors approach the problem of making a good investment. Go behind the scenes of the decision making to discover the process our panelist-investors use to choose and to invest in emerging and seed stage companies. Whether you are planning to launch a company or you are planning the next level, a Seed or Angel investor could be the funding source you are looking for. Maybe you\u2019re not even sure what angel investment is? This panel will focus on the nature of angel and seed investments in New England technology based companies, and on how to obtain that initial angel or seed-stage investment in your company. Two of the speakers will be investors in early stage life science companies and the third speaker an investor in other early stage companies. The panelists will also offer candid views and discussion on how to prepare a company for raising angel capital or seed stage investment, the raise itself, and how to work with angel groups or seed investors after getting the investment.<\/p> <p><b> Panel:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Catherine Friend White, Managing Director, Golden Seeds<\/b>.<\/p> <p>She is an angel investor and entrepreneur.\u00a0 Her career in investment management spans three decades, most recently as founder and president of FinArc, LLC (www.finarc.com).\u00a0 Her investments include companies in marketing, technology, big data and life sciences.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/226247605\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"LETTER and NUMBER TILE NIGHT","id":"226247605","time":1447803000000,"updated":1447862723000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":" 2 Amherst Street, Cambridge, MA ","name":"MIT Tang Center","lon":-71.084457,"id":9075722,"state":"MA","lat":42.360966,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0.742748916149,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446608665000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come to Toastmasters to practice your public speaking skills.

Beaches are some of the world's most dynamic ecological environments. Each grain of sand on the beach has a story to tell; a tale of great travels, interactions with others, and surviving through catastrophic events. The research of Dr. Gontz will take you on a journey that begins to unravel and decipher the stories. Speaker Bio: Allen Gontz is an Associate Professor of Coastal Geology and Geophysics at UMass Boston. His research interest is in coastal geological evolution and how landscapes change over time. Gontz's lab focuses on the investigation of changes to the landscape within the Quaternary that are primarily the result of changing sea-level and anthropogenic impacts.<\/p> <p>Do You Plan to Attend?

There will be pizza and sodas served. Feel free to bring snacks or beverages to share or chip in $5 to $10 for the pizza\/sodas in the pizza cup.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0I really want to play XYZ game, can we schedule it?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0Some people ask for interest in a particular game on the event comments below. \u00a0This may be the way to make sure you get to play the game you want.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Q. \u00a0Where do I park?<\/b><br\/>A. \u00a0The driveway is the obvious spot, but eventually it will fill up on most of these game nights. \u00a0Some people do park on the street. \u00a0The soccer field parking across the street is a safe option and is the suggestion the town police gave me when I asked about overflow parking.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The house is just across from a soccer field.

THIS IS NOT THE WATERTOWN HEALING CENTER. IT IS AROUND THE CORNER ON MAIN ST.<\/p> <p>Join <b>Brynn Bishop<\/b> and <b>Monique Darling<\/b> for a night of diving deep within and without to find the true gift of ourselves and be able to relate from that place with everyone else.<\/p> <p><b>INVITATION: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>What if we treated ourselves the way we wished our Mom\/Dad had treated us? What if we offered ourselves the very things we long for from a lover or best friend? What if we were as kind to ourselves as we would be to a lost child we found alone on the street? What if we loved US the way we long for the beloved to love us?<\/p> <p>DON'T JUST ASK WHAT IF. TRY IT!! Take a moment to imagine someone you truly love. Allow yourself to feel the full extent of your love for that person. Now turn it back on yourself, and feel what it feels like to love yourself THAT much.<\/p> <p><b>OPPORTUNITY: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>If you could have anything, do anything, what would you choose? What do you really want? What is keeping you from having it? Your life is alive with an abundance of possibilities, opportunities, potential - all you have to do is be willing to ask.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>In this workshop you will learn, play, and practice:<\/b><\/p> <p>*To ask for what you want, skillfully and without attachment to the response.<br\/>*To honor, respect, and be grateful for the answer \"no\", and still be hopeful for the answer \"yes\".<br\/>*To be honest and vulnerable about your wants and desires without shame, without deflection, without armor.<br\/>*To hold space for someone who has not yet learned these skills.<br\/>*To own your fears instead of them owning you.<br\/>*To not be afraid to be the one you love the most.<br\/>*To learn to be even more vulnerable when you want to isolate or close down.<\/p> <p>You will gain tools and leave with the ability to relate with everyone in your life with more ease, grace, and blissful contentment from your own center.<\/p> <p>and get to connect with one another through breath, touch, sound, energy and movement.....<\/p> <p>If you ever begin to understand what\/who you are, you could not possibly ever compare yourself to another......envy, wish to impress, to BE different than you are.... for in the beauty, wonder, and awe at discovering how magnificently \"your\" puzzle pieces fit together, at the ever changing infinite ways YOU shift, dance, and weave together, you would laugh in the greatest joy at just a glimpse of the truly miraculous depths that lie within you, within us, each one so unique, so extraordinary, it would take an entire lifetime to only just begin to discover. And yet so often we abandon the quest, the remembrance, the curiosity, the self discovery, to follow another, or invest in relationships, doing what we have been told is the \"right\" way to be. The greatest freedom that we could ever express, imagine, by simply giving myself permission to gently keep returning to me... from here the greatest relating can take place -- from here we can transform the world by simply being 100% us.<\/p> <p>You see you ARE the gift!!<\/p> <p><b>About Your Facilitators:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Monique Darling<\/b>, San Diego, CA, is the founder of Divine Interludes which provides workshops and experiential play-shops in the art of Tantra and conscious loving.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

So why do we continue to see the same software security mistakes made again and again? Complex, expensive tools that live outside of the agile development process don\u2019t help.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Every Sound Healing that I do has a theme. The theme for 11\/18 revolves around Neptune moving out of retrograde and going direct. The changing energy affects us on a mental, physical and emotional level, moving us forward in our spiritual endeavors.<\/p> <p><br\/>Neptune rules the oceans of Earth and is quite fluid, changeable and illusory in nature. Dreams, illusion, abstract thought and the mysterious are all governed by Neptune. Our spirituality is important to this planet, and how we harness that energy for our personal betterment is the focus of 11\/18, which is the day Neptune stops moving backward through the zodiac and resumes its forward movement.<\/p> <p><br\/>Neptune retrograde, which lasts half a year, has been important in helping us to bring critical focus to the confusing and illusory aspects of our life so thatwe may correct them. Neptune retrograde causes us to no longer be able to ignore things like bad relationships, debt or toxic habits. In retrograde, Neptune\u00a0has been pushing us to stop dreaming and start doing as we figure out what is real from fantasy and plan more deliberately for actualizing the future we want to manifest by re-evaluating what is important to us. Now, on 11\/18, as we move out of retrograde, it is the time to explore the space of what we want our future to feel like. With Neptune\u2019s forward turn, we lift the lid on the innerwork of retrograde to move forward with our spiritual and artistic endeavors, leaving behind the unwholesome bonds that do not bring us love, light and balance. Tuning into Neptunian energy can strengthen our sense of discernment to detach from draining delusion and dysfunction and transition to what is soul-nurturing. So don't overthink what Neptunian energy should 'feel' like. Just float and feel the inspiration flow in!<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?<\/p> <p>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be answering the wake-up call to the divine presence ... And trust me, if you come, you will hear it ringing ; )<\/p> <p>Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket\/blindfold) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls. The three I use to entrain the brain to meditation allow the body to enter deep relaxation so that the body, mind and spirit are capable of opening to the really deep work that needs be done!<\/p> <p>What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Suggested donation is $20 and please bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience! \u00a0-Much love<\/p> <p>Brian\u00a0<\/p> <p>Contact: [masked]<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Directly across the street from Wakefield Variety Store","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Soul-Experiments\/events\/226726537\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":4500000,"name":"Toning NepTune: Sea Sounds for Diving Into the Divine","id":"226726537","time":1447893000000,"updated":1447948279000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1316996187000,"name":"Soul Experiments","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":2542822,"urlname":"Soul-Experiments","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Boston","address_1":"204 Tremont St","name":"Limelight Stage & Studios","lon":-71.064568,"id":23503989,"lat":42.351871,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.627571284771,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447611336000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Limelight Comedy Club is back Wednesday, November 18 with headliner Ryan Donahue.

Qigong accelerates healing and has a positive clinically recognized effect on almost all physical symptoms. Qigong helps heal the physical body and release stress of the mind. By moving your body, releasing trigger points, and stimulating your circulatory system, you literally become your own\u00a0massage therapist. Simultaneously these movements help release negative emotions and memories that you no longer need and allow yourself to be much more present in your \"now\" so in a sense you become your own psychiatrist at the same time! Come learn how to build the foundation of being your own health advocate and enjoy emotional freedom and connection to all that is!<\/p> <p><b>CONNECTION, MUSIC, DANCE<\/b><\/p> <p>Then Peter will take you on an expedition, an adventure through movement and connection, both inward and outward as he takes us on a dance journey that has destination stops at each element.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Why were Shiites more successful in limiting violence and providing public goods than Sunnis were in Iraq? Why have many women in the Middle East resorted to increasingly conservative modes of dress in recent decades?<\/p> <p>Many of the current conflicts in the Middle East have been attributed to sectarianism, a politicization of ethnic and religious identity. From the crisis in Iraq and Syria to the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the struggle between Sunni and Shiites groups for dominance is tearing apart the region and shows no signs of abating; however, for all the religious discourse permeating the conflict, much of its roots are political, not religious. How does sectarianism fit into a larger narrative of the Middle East? How have governments manipulated sectarian differences?

But really this historic encounter has been 85 years in the making, ever since 24-year-old Clyde Tombaugh discovered this enigmatic body at the edge of our planetary system. Today we realize that Pluto is among the largest objects in the Kuiper Belt, even though initially it was believed to be a body perhaps as massive as Earth. This presentation traces the history of Pluto - from predictions of its existence, to the discovery of its moons, to its \"demotion\" to dwarf-planet status - and explores the amazing, unexpected findings revealed by New Horizons.

But really this historic encounter has been 85 years in the making, ever since 24-year-old Clyde Tombaugh discovered this enigmatic body at the edge of our planetary system. Today we realize that Pluto is among the largest objects in the Kuiper Belt, even though initially it was believed to be a body perhaps as massive as Earth. This presentation traces the history of Pluto - from predictions of its existence, to the discovery of its moons, to its \"demotion\" to dwarf-planet status - and explores the amazing, unexpected findings revealed by New Horizons.

Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.<\/p> <p><b>By Bus<\/b><\/p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square. \u00a0The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center.\u00a0The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway.\u00a0The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square.\u00a0From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.\u00a0The 77 bus runs between Harvard and Arlington Heights. You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.<\/p> <p><b>By Car<\/b><\/p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts. Take the first left turn from Curtis onto Raymond Street. Ignore the NO LEFT TURN sign, as it is only in effect during rush hours. Raymond runs behind the school. The lot is about half a block down Raymond on the left.<\/p> <p>Street parking is also available one block away on Packard Avenue from Powderhouse Blvd on the hill to the Tufts University campus.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The crystals do not work independently, but are charged to react and work together. Although the crystals in the grid are placed on the ground, the energy of the grids are 3- dimensional\u00a0 to completely surround you. Attendees lay comfortably on mats with pillows and blankets with the crystals around them on the floor, as well as some placed on chosen chakras.<\/p> <p><b>What to wear:<\/b> While experiencing the energy shifting of\u00a0the crystal\u00a0grid, you may see images, or colors, feel\u00a0emotional releasing, tingling, pulsing, or waves of\u00a0heat or coldness.\u00a0Therefore, please dress comfortably and in layers so you may make adjustments for your needs.<\/p> <p><b>About the instructor:<\/b> Trisha Matthies is a Reiki Master Teacher and Crystal Healer who has also trained in Shamanic Healing, Tibetan Bowls, Hypnotherapy, Aromatherapy, and Color Healing. She is also the owner of The Healing Moon Wellness Center located in Foxboro, Ma. Trisha has been working with the healing energies of crystals for over 15 years and enthusiastically shares her passion for these precious stones with her clients and students.<\/p> <p><b>Buzz about my Crystal Grid Workshops:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\"The grid definitely brought down my stress level alot, so that by midway through the session, I was able to totally relax. \u00a0Felt more of that self acceptance. Such a nice way to end a very hectic week! Trish knows how to create the perfect atmosphere to help everyone relax.\" \u00a0I.F.<\/p> <p>\"The grids are always a magical, soul nourishing experience. \u00a0It was wonderful to be in such a beautiful and healing space with welcoming and warm wise women. I felt embraced in my own crystal cocoon of energy. Thanks Trish and Bobbie for offering and setting the place for such a gently transforming experience...It was a night well spent, and highly recommended.\" \u00a0E.L.<\/p> <p>\"The energy at the grids is always electric and all encompassing. Everyone has their own unique experience. No two people have the same encounter. Each person brings something special to the workshop. Love, love, love participating. Time went by in a flash, couldn't believe. A great experience, so healing. Well done Trish! \"T.O.<\/p> <p>\"This was my first grid and it blew my mind! I'm still releasing today...4 days later!\" A.B.<\/p> <p>\"The crystal workshop was intriguing and fun. We each received our own treasure bag of beautiful crystals, which Trish explained beautifully. We learned how to set up the crystals forming our own safe cocoon. Each crystal and stone made a pattern that showered us all with individual energies. And I believe the workshop helped me shift a direction of healing. One thing I know is 2 days later, I woke up singing! Thank you Trish for this great workshop. Sometimes we do things for fun and end up with an added bonus of learning and healing.\" B.L.<\/p> <p>\"This grid workshop was amazing. It's hard to describe what I felt, especially since everyone's experience was different. It was powerful and illuminating. I'm looking forward to taking another session!\" L.B.<\/p> <p>\"The Heart Chakra Crystal Grid Workshop was wonderful!

It fosters spontaneous, playful and vital self-expression and moving, sincere encounters with other participants.<\/p> <p>Biodanza was developed in the 60\u2019s in Chile by anthropologist, psychologist, poet and painter Rolando Toro. It is practiced in over 60 countries, all around the globe.<\/p> <p>\u00c9va Kyzirides has been fueled by a long term passion for dance. She first studied contemporary dance and worked as a dancer \/ choreographer for 10 years. Further, interested in the cultural and social dimension of dance, she has traveled in Asia and Hawaii to study various dance forms. She then completed a Masters\u2019 degree in Dance Ethnology at York University, in Toronto. In 2003, she discovered Biodanza, a therapeutic dance approach which was just starting to set roots in Montr\u00e9al. Three years later, she received her certification as a Biodanza facilitator.<\/p> <p>\u00c9va completed the training to become a Biodanza didactic teacher in 2011 and has been coaching Biodanza facilitators ever since. She is part of the pedagogical committee of the Biodanza SRT School of Montr\u00e9al \u2013 Sud-Ouest du Qu\u00e9bec where she also teaches. She offers Biodanza classes and workshops for adults, as well as for children and families. A founding member of the Biodanza Canada Association, \u00c9va was on the board of directors for 6 years. Biodanza combines her passion for movement with her interest in dance as a means of self-expression, growth and transformation within the human community.<\/p> <p>After class enjoy dancing to music by Robert and then dj Lady Evans<\/p> <p>DJ Lady Evans\u2014 \u201d I love to show the world what I have to give,\u201d she says of creating her sets. \u201cI strive to make people experience music on a higher level, with a very good, strong, and positive message. When I play, I want people to feel happy. I want to bring people together, to show them how we\u2019re all the same and we need to help each other and share joy.<\/p> <p>\n\n\u201cI love creating really big and beautiful atmospheres for parties and clubs, to make each event something special, something memorable, that really touches people,\u201d she says. \u201cEventually, I also want to produce. I don\u2019t want to just take music and play it. I want to create it. I\u2019m doing this because it\u2019s what I love. I believe that\u2019s what I have to give to the world.

We will use Caps Ridge Trail to reach Jefferson and then we will follow Gulfside Trail and some other trails to reach Adams and then Madison.\u00a0From there we will use Valley Way to get to the trailhead. There will be a few steep sections on the way up to Jefferson and then we will be above treeline for most of the day. The Madison Spring Hut is closed for the season.<\/p> <p>If the road to Caps Ridge Trail is closed we will use Lowes Path to Jefferson and then\u00a0follow the same route from there. This will make the overall trip about 14 miles and about 6,400 feet. We will know a\u00a0week or so before\u00a0the trip and will make the necessary\u00a0adjustments to the itinerary.<\/p> <p><b>If you are interested in participating in this event sign up for the waiting list.

If you miss the Morgan Trailhead parking lot, you will end up at the Percival trailhead on the left 1\/8 mile down the road.<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION:<br\/>Mt Morgan Trail to the summit of Mt Morgan (2220' - 1500' gain) - an intermediate hike with views. We will do a loop over to Mt. Percival (2212') and descend along Mt. Percival Trail to connector trail back to the parking lot where we began. This will take around 4-5 hours to complete. GEAR: Dress in layered\/wickable clothing (no cotton) and expect cool temps and some wind up top.<\/p> <p>WEATHER: If there are weather concerns, stay tuned to the meet-up event for updates<br\/>and watch for e-mail notification for those RVSP'D. Rain will cancel.<\/p> <p><br\/>MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE TRAILS:<br\/>The Mt Morgan Trail starts at its parking lot and at .1 miles, a .4-mile connector leaves right to circle around to Mt. Percival Trail but for the ascent we will continue along the Morgan Trail. This becomes a trail ascending to an intersection with Crawford-Ridgepole Trail at 1.7 miles. To the left, the Crawford-Ridgepole heads toward Mount Webster but we veer right toward Mount Morgan. Below the summit is a path left for the adventurous who care to scramble up a set of three ladders. From the ladders you must pass through a cave and climb up and around another cliff until you are on the summit. Others can steer right and follow the main trail to the summit of Morgan. After that summit we retrace our steps a bit until Crawford-Ridgepole Trail directs us .8 miles to Mt Percival Trail. We will descend Mt. Percival via the Mt. Percival Trail until we meet the connector tail back to Mt. Morgan Trail where we started.<br\/>This is a group event. We start together, stay together and finish together. We follow the leader\u2019s instructions. We support each other should circumstances require teamwork. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own.<\/p> <p>Please remember that your Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults.

The historic snow lead to problems with public works, infrastructure, and community access to services. Plus, remember the nightmare that was the MBTA? Out of the mess, a Code for Boston team created the award winning MBTA.ninja, a crowd-sourcing method for reporting transit delays. And it's awesome.<\/p> <p>But this year, we decided to try to get ahead of things. So #HackWinter 2015 is here!<\/p> <p>#HackWinter 2015 is a three-and-a-half week app challenge focusing on winter-specific apps that can help our community in the focus areas of Transit, Infrastructure, and Community. Over the next few weeks, we'll be reaching out to Public Works Departments in the Greater Boston Area as well as community groups, public health agencies, and more to serve as problem owners for the challenge.<\/p> <p>Now the important details: Register for the #HackWinter 2015 app challenge kick-off on Eventbrite.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/hackwinter-2015-kickoff-tickets-19434943439\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/hackwinter-2015-kickoff-tickets-19434943439<\/a><\/p> <p>The kick-off is at 10am on November 21st at the Microsoft Building on 255 Main Street in Kendall Square in Cambridge.

Each set of family members occupies a floor of the home, in accordance to their standing within the family. Poisonous rivalries between sisters-in-law, destructive secrets, and the implosion of the family business threaten to unravel bonds of kinship as social unrest brews in greater Indian society. This is a moment of turbulence, of inevitable and unstoppable change: the chasm between the generations, and between those who have and those who have not, has never been wider. The eldest grandchild, Supratik, compelled by his idealism, becomes dangerously involved in extremist political activism\u2015an action that further catalyzes the decay of the Ghosh home.<br\/>Ambitious, rich, and compassionate, The Lives of Others anatomizes the soul of a nation as it unfolds a family history, at the same time as it questions the nature of political action and the limits of empathy. It is a novel of unflinching power and emotional force.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Book on the table","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-1439\/events\/224564005\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":5400000,"name":"The Lives of Others by Neel Mukherjee at Ritu Ki Rasoi, Burlington","id":"224564005","time":1448125200000,"updated":1448206521000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1219087471000,"name":"Indian Food, Indian Fiction","group_lon":-71.2399978638,"id":1261834,"urlname":"bookclub-1439","group_lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Indian Bookwalas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston,","phone":"617-482-3473","address_1":"205 Berkeley St.","address_2":"Boston, ","name":"Fire and Ice","lon":-71.072722,"id":1029416,"state":"MA","lat":42.350593,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.66615241766,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446519983000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>As Marty suggested, we should have a \"casual lunch to get to know each other\".

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front. Also remember a hat, you need to have your head\/hair covered to serve.<\/p> <p>\u00a0My telephone number if you have any questions or have a last minute change to status is[masked]<\/p> <p>2 things:<br\/>1. Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there. My telephone # is[masked]-1526. Those letting me know that they can't make a day ahead of time won't be considered a no show.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your ongoing support.

The schedule will follow in order:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Safety, Landings and Balance<\/p> <p>Class 1 will be focusing on how to land, move and stay safe practicing Parkour outdoor and in the real world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Vaulting<\/p> <p>Class 2 will focus on the foundation of Parkour - getting over low-level obstacles fast and efficiently through the use of vaulting.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Precisions<\/p> <p>Class 3 will focus on accuracy of jumping and foot\/eye coordination honing basic standing and running jumps.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Wall Techniques\u00a0<\/p> <p>Class 4 will focus on conquering obstacles too large or tall to vault, in tandem with using walls as a means to keep a more efficient run.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Tumbling\/Acro<\/p> <p>Class 5 focus is on tumbling and\u00a0acrobatic\u00a0skills, in pursuit of fully understanding movement in a 3D space and total\u00a0proprioception.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Flow + Speed<\/p> <p>Class 6 links together all the previous lessons into one cohesive movement, and a timed obstacle course setting.<\/p> <p>------<\/p> <p>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Anything else?<\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewEnglandParkour\/events\/226743754\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":3600000,"name":"[Boston] Parkour 101 - Introduction to Parkour \/\/","id":"cllfmlytpbdc","time":1448208000000,"updated":1448212547000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284132267000,"name":"New England Parkour and Free Running Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1704666,"urlname":"NewEnglandParkour","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Traceurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"Assembly Row, 301 Canal Street","name":"American Fresh","lon":-71.079163,"id":24206659,"state":"MA","lat":42.394226,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.41554737091,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447374481000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join other runners, Whippets and non-Whippets alike, a fun and free 5k at Somerville Brewing Co.'s Assembly Row beer garden.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dashing-whippets-boston\/events\/226738537\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Slumbrew Happy Soles Fun Run 5k","id":"226738537","time":1448208000000,"updated":1448220040000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446688625000,"name":"Dashing Whippets Running Team - Boston Chapter","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19091782,"urlname":"dashing-whippets-boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Boston Dashing Whippets"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02210","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"155 Seaport Blvd","name":"Rosa Mexicano","lon":-71.043518,"id":8995732,"state":"MA","lat":42.350758,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":22,"distance":1.49830067158,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443301972000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Antes del show de tango a las 3 pm, comamos en el restaurante Rosa Mexicano.

In Secular Meditation, step-by-step instructions, personal stories, and provocative questions teach empathy for others, stress reduction, and the kind of in-the-moment living that fosters appreciation for life and resilience in the face of adversity. Heller simplifies what is often found mysterious, describing and providing detailed instructions for 32 different practices, ensuring that anyone can find the right one.<\/p> <p>Heller simplifies what is often found mysterious -- \"If you have ever loved or even liked another person, you have the prerequisites for learning kindness meditation\" -- and invites all to partake in \"awe and wonder at the rich experience of being alive.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Secular-Buddhists\/events\/226420652\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Secular Meditation Book Party","id":"226420652","time":1448217000000,"updated":1448230175000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1285116716000,"name":"Cambridge Secular Buddhists","group_lon":-71.0800018311,"id":1710691,"urlname":"Cambridge-Secular-Buddhists","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692537784576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447804889000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's make the most of the fall weather before we get snowed in!
