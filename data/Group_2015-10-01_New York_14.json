Actors must have a good grasp of the inner workings of the character they must portray and the psychological skills necessary to generate and fully inhabit roles which they may not have experienced in their own lives. Psychology - in particular, psychodynamic approaches - provides a deep understanding of emotion and behavior that can help you create more richly nuanced characters and improve your acting technique.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>At each meeting we will discuss a different emotion or aspect of the human condition in the context of psychoanalytic principles that provide insight into the fundamental drives and conflicts that direct our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will examine aspects of the human behaviors and attempt to relate them to character-building frameworks such as Uta Hagen\u2019s Nine Questions, imaginative approaches such as Stella Adler's method, and conceptual frameworks such as Freud\u2019s model of the mind. We'll share and examine our own experiences and gain insights into our behaviors and those around us. These insights, and your ability to creatively adapt them, can improve your ability to build realistic and unique characters and help you be more comfortable, charismatic, and confident in your auditions and roles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please note these workshops are &nbsp;best suited for actors, screenwriters, and performing artists and are not intended for psychology professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of topics we will cover in individual workshops:<\/p>\n<p>* Greed<\/p>\n<p><span>* Anxiety<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>* Jealousy <br><\/p>\n<p>* Depression<\/p>\n<p>* Grief<\/p>\n<p>* Addiction<\/p>\n<p>* Stage self vs. Real Self&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>About the Organizer: Actors' Psychology Workshops founder Dr. Matthew Paldy has taught at colleges in New York City and Rhode Island, developed the Critical Thinking Program for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and served as a consultant to the NYC Department of Education's iLearnNYC Program.

It is through applying oneself, that one becomes, and it is in the struggle to have ones existence confirmed, and validated that we discover love; the only thing that gives life meaning, beyond which, life is absurd. <br><\/p>\n<p>Members of \u201cTeam Good Guys\u201d, should want for others, what they want for themselves; to be able to think critically, to be empowered with knowledge, and to have opportunities to apply that knowledge; without both, the other is useless; and lastly, \u201cTeam Good Guys\u201d, wants to be surrounded by others who encourage, and support them to live in the \u201cSpirit of Goodness\u201d. <br><\/p>\n<p>The world was built in the \u201cSpirit of Goodness\u201d, and anything that is the antithesis of \u201cgoodness\u201d annihilates existence. \u201cGoodness\u201d leads us toward love; the confirmation, and validation of existence.<\/p>\n<p>Members of \u201cTeam Good Guys\u201d are empowered persons; they don\u2019t sacrifice others to themselves, or sacrifice themselves to others. As such, they do not allow others to sacrifice them. In life, we cannot ask for respect, and we cannot demand it; we must command it! Being a member of \u201cTeam Good Guys\u201d means that you have to cultivate, and maintain yourself in \u201cThe Spirit of Goodness\u201d. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to spend time with children who have cancer, and interact with them, without reflecting their cancer back to them. <br> <\/p>\n<p>This group requires membership dues, and is fee-based, because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth. <br><\/p>\n<p>I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others. I want you to value yourself. Join me, and let's work to make this group great, for everyone!

Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey"},"members":19,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

I thought to myself, maybe I should try Craigslist. The moment I started to comb through Craigslist for a roommate I got overwhelmed and simply gave up. I couldn't tell who was authentic or who was a bot. The first emails I sent left me bombarded with spam.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I tried two other sites that I will not mention here because it is not important but they could not deliver what I was expecting. Plus, the ritual of going back and forth instead of simply meeting and deciding within a short time and move on with my live was taking too much time. The frustration got to me and if you are here I believe you share this frustration. I have good news for you however. We can take the reins and take back control. Who says we need a third party to find you a roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This meetup will serve to find to find, professionals like yourself, &nbsp;a roommate that meets your expectations. The success of this meetup will be in direct correlation to your commitment in showing up and participating. Basically, do not waste my time as I will not waster yours.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>The format of the meetup will be the same each week and will be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>1. Pre-populated Questionnaire \u2013 You will only have to do this once and given that your criteria for a roommate does not change you won\u2019t have to do this ever again&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>2. First 10 minutes - Chat or mingle or whatever you New Yorkers want to call it.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>3. Then 20 minutes of \"algorithmically\" matching you up with a roommate. Basically, I will use the information from the questionnaire to match you up with a few people and you get to decide if you want to talk with this person or not.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4. Then another 25 minutes of you walking over and talking to someone that you think might be a great roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>5. 5 minutes wrap up. You get to hear the success stories of people who found their roommate for that session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/highres_440841330.jpeg","photo_id":440841330,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/600_440841330.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_440841330.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11996088,"name":"Alfie Walker"},"members":9,"name":"Roommate Matchup for Professionals - New York City","id":18826991,"state":"NY","urlname":"Roommate-Matchup-for-Professionals-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Alfie"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439411717000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Womens-Cycling-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are many great women's cycling groups in NYC, but this one will focus on the LBTQ community.

We focus on each member putting up work in an atmosphere of helping one another using a simple and effective system called \u2026LIFE ACTING...with an emphasis on ON CAMERA work. Life Acting is summed up in the question: \u201cWhat does your character want from the other actors\/characters and how are you going to get it? At the current time, we are limited to 10 committed actors. The experience level is not the key issue here, but the willingness to make a commitment to the work. Each workshop is only $25. The initial one will take place from 7pm to 10pm on Thursday, September 24th My goal for this is to develop an encouraging and safe place to work and improve our craft as actors.

All my life I was a skinny in shape person (134 lbs). Ten years ago injured my feet and could no longer run. I would lay on a couch from the minute I came home from work until I had to go back. Im now 49 years old, 209 lbs and round. I have my foot pain under control for about 2 years now, and desire to run again. I love exercising (PT) in groups like when I was in the Army. So here is what I want to do:<\/p> \n<p>I figure after the summer is over and everybody goes back to work, I would like to start a morning exercise (PT) group, that would meet, Monday thru Saturday in the morning. We will start very slow, super duper slow, and over the course of time build ourselves up and lose weight at the same time.<\/p> \n<p>We motivate each other and as we do it each day, and as time goes by it will become easier and feel less awkward. Like the lottery, you got to be in it to win it.<\/p> \n<p>Here are a few ideas that I have as I live in Spyten Duyvil. We can either meet in Van Cortland Park, Inwood Park or at the base of the Henry Hudson Bridge and make our way over to Inwood park. Or we can do Palisades Ave for a very slow start and build up over time to a full throttle.

I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions. I have a whole series of future events and plans that I am working on but this is a simple start.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176296482,"name":"Daso"},"members":14,"name":"New York Radio Control Airplanes Meetup","id":18842509,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Radio-Control-Airplanes-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Flyers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439841130000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"flash-mobs","name":"Flash Mobs","id":25168},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"anything-and-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-do","name":"Anything and everything you've ever wanted to do.","id":56684},{"urlkey":"random-fun","name":"Random Fun","id":100994},{"urlkey":"a-little-bit-of-everything","name":"A little bit of everything","id":125692},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-adventure","name":"Spontaneous Adventure","id":169461},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-meetups","name":"Spontaneous Meetups","id":607482},{"urlkey":"any-spontaneous-fun-suggestions","name":"Any spontaneous fun suggestions!","id":1028392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Spontaneous-People\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is an experimental Meetup group for those of us who do things a bit more impromptu: we might wake up on a Saturday morning and decide to go rock climbing or hiking; or we thought we were going to have a mellow weekend but get a little restless.

I AM native to the high desert of central Mexico, of Toltec ancestry, born in the land of the Chichimeca. I recently relocated to New York from Los Angeles, CA. and I look forward to contributing sound vibration therapy as a healing art modality. I offer to guide my fellow sound alchemists into a beautiful dream through which we will all reach a zero point state of being. My intention for NY Sound Alchemy is to create a comfortable, invigorating, magical, mysterious, and healing \"sound-bath\/sound-scape\" for my guests. I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage &amp; Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal &amp; Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

We need your energy and your voice in the upcoming months to help Bernie Sanders get elected the 45th President of the United States. We know that Bernie Sanders is the ONLY candidate that is going to improve the quality of life for people of color in this country. And it\u2019s on us (black people) to share this message with our family, friends and communities. We need to organize and mobilize from now through November of 2016. We started African Americans for Bernie (#AAFB) to accomplish this very goal. We know there are a lot of black folks that are supportive of Bernie, but so far, we only exist online. We want to step from behind the screens for a moment and get together in person to meet one another and talk. There are a lot of events coming up, rallies, conferences, so we want to pull everything and everyone together and talk about we can all do together to help get Bernie Sanders elected.

Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types.

We are going to try something different; we will get together, read a book of our own choosing (you must bring your own book), and afterward, each member will explain to the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. What compelled you to choose the book that you were reading.<\/p>\n<p>2. What are your learning from the book, and how are you applying it to life.<\/p>\n<p>3. Convince other members, why they should read the book. <br><\/p>\n<p>In life, you can never tell others what to read, listen to, or watch; their lives, and their desires lead them toward discovering themselves, but you can influence them, and even if they do not follow your lead immediately, they may do so in the future when the need arises. I often see people reading books, and I want to know what they are reading, and why they are reading it. What you are compelled to read, or avoid reading is a reflection of you. It not only matters that you read, what you read matters! Join me at the New York Public Library Schwarzman Building, as I sit among the tourists, and enjoy the works of the masters, and give them their due, by immersing myself in their works. At the conclusion of the 2 hours, we will share our thoughts (each member receiving 5 minutes of time, and I getting the last word before we conclude) about what we are reading, and hopefully we will be able to inspire each other. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join me, and we will travel into the minds of others, use their knowledge, and wisdom to improve ourselves, our lives, and the world that enabled us to be! <br><\/p>\n<p>I just want to warn you guys, that prior to attending this event, I will be practicing Krav Maga. Only a true badass, can practice kicking ass, and then sit down, and enjoy reading a book, while lesser men, resist reading, and want to fight. You can't do the latter without the former, or else the consequences will be severe for you!<\/p>\n<p>This group requires membership dues, and is fee-based, because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth.<\/p>\n<p> I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others. I want you to value yourself. Join me, and let's work to make this group great, for everyone!

We are the ONLY business alliance in the Newark area focused on SMALL businesses. Promoting, connecting, advising, advocating on YOUR behalf for greater visibility... OUR FOCUS is LOCALISM and driving $$$ and sustainability to your business. We have a signature event called the ReMIXX every month where we feature an entrepreneur. NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals! Let's travel together and not be conformed to this world BUT see the beautiful world God has created!!! There's so much out there to see and I've only touched 9% of the countries in this world. I have a lot more traveling to do!! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.travbuddy.com\/maps\/6880222\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.travbuddy.com\/maps\/6880222<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Will you Join?<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/4\/b\/highres_441743883.jpeg","photo_id":441743883,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/4\/b\/600_441743883.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/4\/b\/thumb_441743883.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":168331142,"name":"Nadege"},"members":20,"name":"Christian Traveling Educators","id":18908861,"state":"NY","urlname":"Christian-Traveling-Educators","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.75,"who":"CTE's"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441665403000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"vegan","name":"Vegan","id":408},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"rawfood","name":"Raw Food","id":1983},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"wholefood","name":"Whole Food Nutrition","id":5951},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"organic-foods","name":"Organic Foods","id":15485},{"urlkey":"natural-skin-care","name":"Natural Skin Care","id":15808},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"safe-and-natural-skin-care-and-nutrionals","name":"safe and natural skin care and nutrionals","id":392181}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/wholeclarity\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This meetup is geared towards motivating, supporting and having fun with a holistic, organic, plant based lifestyle that feeds the body, mind, and soul so that we create even more beauty in our lives, community, and world.<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>Lesson #1, remember to take care of yourself!

The goals for this group are to bring people together, challenge ourselves, have fun and form new friendships! Members are also HIGHLY encouraged to recommend ideas and set up meetups. Some of the meetups will include dancing, amusement parks, day\/weekend trips to other cities (Phila, Boston, Atlantic City,), ice skating, rollerskating, fitness (yoga, bootcamps), etc, acting improv classes, movies and dinner, day parties (monthly bday celebrations), games, expos, etc. Most of the meetups will have a cap limit.

For practice, I often perform in the NYC Subway; I use those performances to invent and develop new musical ideas in front of the commuting audience.&nbsp; This has already contributed to the recording of CD collection of my original music. <br><\/p>\n<p>Your age is not important.&nbsp; We will have bands with young musicians, bands with older musicians, bands with young and old mixed, and everything in between. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/8\/4\/highres_441770820.jpeg","photo_id":441770820,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/8\/4\/600_441770820.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/8\/4\/thumb_441770820.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":6080366,"name":"Kenti"},"members":51,"name":"Starting a Great Band","id":18910784,"state":"NY","urlname":"Starting-a-Great-Band","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Maniacs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441715450000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"digital-marketer","name":"Digital Marketer","id":258432},{"urlkey":"leveraging-big-data","name":"Leveraging Big Data","id":579052},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-analytics","name":"Digital Marketing Analytics","id":785142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Behavioral-Analytics-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for anyone interested in data analytics and data science, specifically  behavioral analytics, and how they can be leveraged to pull more actionable intelligence.

Needless to say the Manhattan of my twenties is not my reality now. All my friends who have babies took off for the suberbs and think I'm crazy for coming back! But I'm not, I love all the city had to offer for parents of little ones. My three year old son and I love exploring new parks, crafts at the libraries, just riding the train for fun, and trying new restaurants (that one depends on how well he napped). All this is great but a little lonely so I'd love to meet some mom\/dads who feel the same. Currently I work part time have have a flexible schedule; so weekdays, weekends, parties that don't start until midnight because the in-laws will be on morning duty, really anything!

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws. Forge new friendships and get support based on healthy living. &nbsp;The program is free to users except for the shared cost of the meal, about $15\/meeting.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/8\/b\/highres_442270379.jpeg","photo_id":442270379,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/8\/b\/600_442270379.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/8\/8\/b\/thumb_442270379.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8033889,"name":"Michael Rickicki"},"members":83,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","id":18957225,"state":"NY","urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"East Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442936166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"nature-walks","name":"Nature Walks","id":19666},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"women-motivating-women","name":"Women Motivating Women","id":85459}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/All-Women-Adventure-Travel-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for people who want to bond through international travel.
