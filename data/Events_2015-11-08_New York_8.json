It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p>The CSC will be led by Collective founder <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterbliss.com\">Peter Bliss<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see!\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterbliss.com\"><b>Peter Bliss<\/b><\/a> songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band,\u00a0Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties.\u00a0He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film. He\u2019s shared his expertise creating workshop and event programs for the Songwriters Hall of Fame and now the New York Songwriters Collective.

Garbage\u00a0collection, type inference, higher-order functions, and polymorphic\u00a0type abstractions are just some examples of innovative features that\u00a0have emerged from research in these languages. Expert programmers\u00a0cherish these features because they can significantly increase a\u00a0programmer's productivity. However, these advanced language features\u00a0are often difficult to master because they require a deep\u00a0understanding of the inner workings of the compiler.<\/p> <p>Type inference is a prime example of a language feature that can boost \u00a0productivity but can also be a usability nightmare. A type inference \u00a0algorithm infers the types of expressions in a program based on how \u00a0these expressions are used. The compiler can thus provide strong \u00a0static correctness guarantees about a program without requiring the\u00a0programmer to annotate the program with type information. On the other hand, automated type inference can also be counterproductive. If a conflicting use of an expression (i.e. a type mismatch) is detected, the compiler reports the corresponding program location as the source<br\/>of the type error. However, the actual error source is often elsewhere in the program. This results in confusing error messages. The programmer needs to understand the basic workings of the inference algorithm to interpret the error message correctly and debug the program. This can often be a frustrating experience.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will explain how type inference algorithms work and why type error localization is so difficult in the presence of type inference. I will then present a new algorithm for localizing type errors that provides formal quality guarantees about the identified type error sources. The algorithm works efficiently in practice and has the potential to significantly improve the quality of type error reports produced by state-of-the-art compilers.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p>Thomas Wies is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science\u00a0Department of New York University.

There are 1.2 billion people worldwide living in extreme poverty, and although this number is declining, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where the number of poor individuals has risen. (World Bank, 2013) Karina Weinstein, FXB USA Program Director, will share how the pioneering FXBVillage methodology is breaking the cycle of poverty in countries across Africa and worldwide. The FXBVillage methodology is a field-tested model that is now available online (<a href=\"https:\/\/fxb.org\/toolkit\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/fxb.org\/toolkit\/<\/a>) in an open-source toolkit that was developed with input from experts at Harvard University. For over 25 years, the methodology has delivered extraordinary results in more than 150 FXBVillages and is currently active in seven developing countries. Over three years, the FXBVillage methodology brings the extreme poor to self-sufficiency by simultaneously tackling the five drivers of poverty: food, education, income, health and housing. Independent evaluations have shown that four years after the FXBVillage program\u2019s end, 86 percent of FXBVillage families are able to maintain long-term self-sufficiency, and their children are able to stay in school and succeed.<\/p> <p>Previously, Karina Weinstein was a Program Associate at the Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc. and Director at Beck Community Development Foundation. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations from Tufts University and a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University, Kennedy School of Government.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Progress-and-Prosperity-Land-and-Liberty-New-York-City\/events\/225923690\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Communities of Hope, Opportunity and Prosperity \u2013 The FXB Village Model","id":"225923690","time":1446071400000,"updated":1446080309000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1350315086000,"name":"Progress and Prosperity, Land and Liberty \u2013 New York City","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":5400112,"urlname":"Progress-and-Prosperity-Land-and-Liberty-New-York-City","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Georgists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"200 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor","name":"BuzzFeed","lon":-73.989494,"id":16442692,"state":"NY","lat":40.741966,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":0.556978642941,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444236994000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a night for hackers to get together to contribute to open source projects.<\/p> <p>The goal of the evening is to set aside a little time to give back to the community, improve your resume, become a better programmer, meet other hackers, and make a dent in the universe.

(This is the important milestone at which can begin to solicit and accept donor contributions---Huzzah!) BTW, \"CUBE\" stands for \"Center for Urban Business Entrepreneurship.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>+++<\/p> <p>As promised above, here is <b>Rev 2.0<\/b> of our <b>Health Maker Lab \"Mission Statement(s).\"<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>(As remarked prior, this is probably the most important \"public positioning\" we make. Everything else really stems from this memorialized \"action concept\"---of what we will do as NfP Health Maker Lab:)\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p><b><i>Our Mission (Short Form); aka \u201cPositioning Statement\u201d:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Health Maker Lab Empowers Citizen-Scientists To Create Healthcare Solutions At The Community MakerRoots<\/p> <p><b><i>Our Health Maker Lab Mission:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our Health Maker Lab (HML) is designed to help inspire, develop and support novel Healthcare (HC) solutions for the betterment of patient outcomes. These improved HC results---in both lower cost and higher quality---will include the generation of new Healthcare-related Middle-Class jobs in New York City\u2019s ultra-urban communities.<\/p> <p>Compared to other industrialized nations, our United States Healthcare system delivers care that costs twice as much as the next most-expensive country. At the same time, our overall patient outcomes rank below the average of all other advanced nations.<\/p> <p>Our burgeoning HML Community is appropriately rooted in New York City. Because: this is the Nation\u2019s \u201cHealthcare Capital,\u201d the HQ of American 3D Printing and the locus of the second largest tech-business population in the country. Thus, we believe that our NYC-based HML is uniquely positioned to respond to our countrywide, on-going, Healthcare crisis.<\/p> <p>Hence, we are creating a New York State, Not-for-Profit (NfP) organization that is designed to empower Citizen-Scientists to create Healthcare solutions.<\/p> <p>HML will take maximum advantage of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s worldwide \u201cchange engines.\u201d We will house and integrated these \u201cengines\u201d in each of our stand-alone, neighborhood-based, multi-discipline Labs. As we add new HMLs, each will join our evolving and cross-supporting Network of Labs in NYC.<\/p> <p>Our HMLs will become experiential destinations---venues of excitement, edutainment and entrepreneurship---for HealthTech tourism, Community education and inspiration for Life-Science startups.<\/p> <p>Our HML solution drivers will include: (1) the new Maker Movement ethos; (2) technology disruption and democratization (\u201cDisDem\u201d); (3) community confabs (\u201cComCon\u201d) through physical and online proximity; and (4) new modes of tech education. These last embrace Project-Based Learning, hands-on\/minds-on neo-apprenticeships, online knowledge repositories, MOOCs (massive open online courses), just-in-time education, on-demand training and specific-need\/job-generation \"bootcamps.\"<\/p> <p>Our Health Maker Lab (HML) Community believes that our national Healthcare system---with its out-of-control costs delivering mediocre results---does NOT accord with our citizenries\u2019 faith in American \u201cexceptionalism.\u201d We believe empowering today\u2019s MakerRoots Citizen-Scientists is a key solution to our national Healthcare (HC) problem---a set of systemic \u201cills\u201d that represents THE paramount political, financial and societal problem in the U.S. today.<\/p> <p>To begin, HML will be take the conceptual, organizational and physical form of a \u201cMaker Space.\u201d However, the activities in our Health Maker Lab will be focused on a new domain of \u201cmaking.\u201d This literal and figurative \u201cspace\u201d will be designed to help participants---such as Citizen LifeScientists, BioMakers, MedTechies, HealthTinkers, MakerNurses and more---tech-play, experiment, construct hardware, develop software and subsequently create novel Healthcare synergies and solutions.<\/p> <p>We are planning to open our archetypal HML in Brooklyn, NY in mid-2016. This new-concept Lab will serve as the precursor to a network of NYC HMLs. In future and from the start, each added Lab \u201cnode\u201d will be designed for ongoing collaboration, digital interaction and continual co-evolution within our eventual HML network.<\/p> <p>Each local Lab will empower our various \u201cBio\/Med\u201d Makers---and their Healthcare solution-making---at the neighborhood MakerRoots. With co-located---yet diverse---disciplines, each HML will foster the success synergies of cross-pollinated solutions in-house. Each \u201cnetworked\u201d HML Community, its various \u201cAction Centers\u201d and individual Teams\/Members will---separately and as a group---help \u201ccure\u201d our national HC dysfunction.<\/p> <p>Our goal is HML\u2019s successful solution-provisioning around Healthcare Making, Bio\/Med Tech, HC Entrepreneurship and Health-Job Generation at the ultra-urban, neighborhood level in New York City.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>[End: Mission Statement]\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>+++<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Rounding out these Mission Statements, we have also created a Vision Statement and a Values Statement.<\/p> <p><b>+++<\/b><\/p> <p><b>As showcased before here, I'm continuing my \"field research.\" This means my personal \"tours\" of complementary Maker Spaces, Bio Labs, design firms and HC-Player events in NYC.

But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work.

By understanding the fundamental differences between directed (ordered) systems and emergent (un-ordered) systems, we can modify our approach to match the context of the problem we are facing.

and solid, concentrated wines that are firmly tannic yet seldom rough or alcoholic.\u201d\u00a0 Of the three Brunellos we\u2019re trying, I think the Pieve Santa Restituta, made by the superstar winemaker Gaja, fits the first category\u2014incredibly elegant and complex.\u00a0 The San Filippo falls into the second category\u2014more robust and tannic, with interesting spice notes.\u00a0 I\u2019d add a third category, into which the third Brunello, the Val di Suga, falls\u2014a friendly, accessible style, easy to drink, ready now.<\/p> <p><i>Chianti Classico:<\/i>\u00a0 Chianti has come a long way from those clich\u00e9d straw-wrapped flask bottles.\u00a0 The original DOC regulations from 1967 preserved archaic practices (such as requiring the inclusion of some white grapes in the blend) and set no limits on yield or production, which resulted in huge quantities of indifferent Chianti wine.\u00a0 But the rules are more stringent now\u2014the blend must be at least 80 percent Sangiovese (with no white grapes used), there are limits on production and vine density, and vineyards must be on favorable hillside sites within a historic zone to qualify as \u201cClassico.\u201d\u00a0 Chianti Classico requires 12 months of aging before release, 24 months for Riserva wines.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be trying the Chianti Classico made by Fontodi, one of the stars of the appellation, famous for their Vigna del Sorbo Riserva wine as well as their \u201cSupertuscan\u201d Flaccianello.\u00a0 But even their entry-level Classico is a highly respected wine.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Vino Nobile di Montepulciano:<\/i>\u00a0 East of Montalcino and southeast of the Chianti region is Montepulciano, one of the most historic wine regions of Tuscany\u2014its wines were favored by 15th and 16th century aristocracy.\u00a0 DOCG rules require that it be made from at least 70 percent Sangiovese (although in practice most winemakers use 100 percent Sangiovese), followed by two years of aging, one year in oak (usually large oak casks that minimally influence the flavor of the wine). \u00a0Advocates of Vino Nobile claim that the wine combines the best qualities of Chianti Classico Riserva (perfumed aromatics) and Brunello (rich texture and tannins), but it has never quite regained the prestige it enjoyed in previous centuries.\u00a0 Our Vino Nobile was made by Canneto, a reliable producer on a historic property.<\/p> <p><i>IGT Toscana:<\/i>\u00a0 IGT stands for <i>Indicazione Geografica Tipica,<\/i> and is the equivalent of France\u2019s Vin de Pays category.\u00a0 IGT Toscana wines can be made in any area of Tuscany and are free of the restrictive regulations of the DOCs and DOCGs.\u00a0 Far from being an indicator of lesser quality, some of Italy\u2019s most prestigious wines, the so-called \u201cSupertuscans,\u201d are labeled IGT because they are made from unconventional grape blends that do not conform to DOC rules, or are made from grapes grown in unauthorized areas.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying the Viticcio Prunaio, an IGT Toscana made from 100 percent Brunello clone Sangiovese.<\/p> <p>To get us started, we\u2019ll begin with a Tuscan white, a Vermentino made by Antinori.\u00a0 As usual, we\u2019ll be tasting the reds blind\u2014let\u2019s see if we can pick out the Brunellos!<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be heading up to the Upper East Side this time, to the Italian restaurant 83\u00bd, which allows BYOB on Wednesdays.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eighty-threeandahalf.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eighty-threeandahalf.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eighty-threeandahalf.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2014 Antinori Guado al Tasso Vermentino\u00a0 $21<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16\/20<\/i> \u2013 Impressive fruit weight with a slightly reductive whiff.

Much of the intensity comes from oak use with pretty layers of cinnamon and nutmeg that add to the overall concentration and density of the wine. Smooth and velvety in the mouth, the wine lasts long and delivers generous fruit flavors that add weight and importance to the finish. The wine adopts a plush and modern style, but it does so impeccably.

The wine ages in <i>botte grande<\/i> for 26 months and the slow oxidation has done much to increase the aromatic intensity of the wine. Bold and chewy with thick lines, this wine also shows tight wood astringency that should soften, to a good extent, with time. There are sweet tones of baking spice and sweet cherry syrup on the close.

She has personally experienced the extraordinary benefits of a STEM education and dance. After studying mechanical engineering at MIT and being an avid dancer for 21 years, she switched gears to teach high school algebra in an underserved community in East New York, Brooklyn through Teach For America. As a teacher, her eyes were opened to the multitude of opportunities her students didn't have access to.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/224983382\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytnblc","time":1446073200000,"updated":1446087125000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07030","country":"us","city":"Hoboken","address_1":"38 Jackson St. 2nd Floor","address_2":"Use black double doors at south end of Jackson st.","name":"MakerBar","lon":-74.041795,"id":6693352,"state":"NJ","lat":40.737305,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.85582017899,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440635402000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as we talk all things HTTP.<\/p> <p>Doors open at 7, and at 8 we'll have a talk on some new web technology, including new javascript clients, new webserver technology, and all the little bits in between.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/e\/0\/600_129193792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>[PLEASE NOTE: All minors must be accompanied by parent and or guardian.] <\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>MakerBar is a 501(c)3 NJ Non-Profit Organization..<\/b> All donations are tax deductible.....consider donating today...Help keep the H@ck3ry alive!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Interested in membership?

We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours. The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20. Please be timely, because we do not open our doors once we begin our meditation (for obvious reasons :).

Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

And it\u2019s utterly false. Authors David Orenstein and Linda Ford Blaikie disprove the smear in the most persuasive possible way: by telling the stories of dozens of real-life nonbelievers who devote their lives to doing good for others.<\/p> <p>Orenstein and Blaikie\u2019s new book,\u00a0Godless Grace: How Nonbelievers Are Making the World Safer, Richer and Kinder, portrays nonbelievers both from America and around the world. Some examples:<\/p> <p>The nonbeliever soldier, who joined the army to fight religious fanaticism at age 40, right after September 11;<\/p> <p>The crusader against sexual harassment in Panama;<\/p> <p>The Filipino nurse practitioner who builds bridges between her humanist organization and religious groups to fight violence against LGBTQ individuals;<\/p> <p>The former Lutheran who took a pay cut to work as a paramedic so he could help others;<\/p> <p>The British survivor of priest sex abuse who now devotes her time to aiding other victims;<\/p> <p>The Hungarian who fights against the billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade in southeast Asia;<\/p> <p>The Argentine mechanical engineer who develops joint replacements in his day job, and organizes nonbelievers \u2013 in the land of Pope Francis \u2013 in his spare time;<\/p> <p>The Canadian who developed an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous for fellow nonbelievers.<\/p> <p>Orenstein and Blaikie describe not only what these folks do, but why. Hint: fear of hell has nothing to do with it!<\/p> <p>Going beyond the individual profiles,\u00a0Godless Grace\u00a0presents a comprehensive picture of nonbelief around the world and predicts where the movement is heading. With a forward by prominent secular professor Dr. Phil Zuckerman and an afterward by President of American Atheists David Silverman, it is a must-read for anyone looking for definitive proof that people can be \"good without a god.\"<\/p> <p>Godless Grace: How Nonbelievers Are Making the World Safer, Richer and Kinder\u00a0will be available from Humanist Press in October 2015.<\/p> <p>-----------------------<\/p> <p><br\/><b>LOCATION: SLC Conference Center, 15 West 39th St. (3rd Floor)<\/b><b><\/p> <p><\/b><b>COST: $10 <\/b><b>Donation covers room rental.<\/b><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>=====================================<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atheists-24\/events\/225476777\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":9000000,"name":"BOOK: Godless Grace: - ORENSTEIN\/BLAIKIE - OCTOBER 29, 2015 (THURSDAY) 6:30PM","id":"xccwklytnbmc","time":1446157800000,"updated":1446195164000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035947374000,"name":"New York City Atheists Meetings","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12907,"urlname":"atheists-24","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Atheists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"18 West 18th (between 5th & 6th ave)","name":"Cap 21 Studios Floor 6, Studio 4","lon":-73.992867,"id":24127573,"state":"NY","lat":40.742809,"repinned":false},"headcount":11,"distance":0.520183980465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443771502000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This is a weekly improv class appropriate for all levels (including beginners). \u00a0The focus will be on scenework, rather than games.<\/b><\/p> <p>-- Are you a bit shy and looking to get more comfortable with your public speaking?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>-- Are you a working professional hoping to be a bit more spontaneous during your meetings and interactions with co-workers?\u00a0<\/p> <p>-- Or are you an actor or improv comedian looking to take your craft to the next level or get more reps?<\/p> <p>Then this is the class for you!

A more accurate translation of sexual magic would be \"sexual priesthood.\"<\/p> <p>In ancient times, the priest was always accompanied by a priestess, for they represent the divine forces at the base of all creation: the masculine and feminine, the Yab-Yum, Ying-Yang, Father-Mother: the Elohim.<\/p> <p>Sex magic\u00a0(sometimes spelled\u00a0sex magick) is any type of\u00a0sexual activity\u00a0used in\u00a0magical,\u00a0ritualistic\u00a0or otherwise\u00a0religious\u00a0and\u00a0spiritual\u00a0pursuits. One practice of sex magic is using the energy of\u00a0sexual arousal\u00a0or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise of sex magic is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to\u00a0transcend\u00a0one's normally perceived reality.<\/p> <p>The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph,\"If a man has an intelligent and loving wife, with whom he is in complete accord, he can work out the problems [of how to achieve magical results] by her aid. They are a radical soul-sexive series of energies...The rite is a prayer in all cases, and the most powerful [that] earthly beings can employ...it is best for both man and wife to act together for the attainment of the mysterious objects sought. Success in any case requires the adjuvancy of a superior woman. THIS IS THE LAW!\"<\/p> <p>In the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer\u00a0Ida Craddock\u00a0published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably\u00a0Heavenly Bridegrooms\u00a0and\u00a0Psychic Wedlock.\u00a0Aleister Crowley\u00a0reviewed\u00a0Heavenly Bridegroomsin the pages of his journal\u00a0The Equinox, stating that it was: \"..one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. ...This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.\"<\/p> <p>Carl Kellner, the founder of Ordo Templi Orientis, (O.T.O.), claimed to have learned the techniques of sex magic from three adepts in this art. Aleister Crowley became involved with\u00a0Theodor Reuss\u00a0and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of\u00a0The Book of Lies\u00a0between 1912 and 1913. According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX\u00b0 (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him \"Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains.<\/p> <p>The exhibition will also feature an installation by Barry William Hale that will be visibile from the street and will change depending on outside light conditions.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.shishigami.com\/srfa\/Jel_Ena\/ellenstag.jpghttp:\/\/www.shishigami.com\/srfa\/Jel_Ena\/LuZhang.jpghttp:\/\/www.shishigami.com\/srfa\/Jel_Ena\/ceremony.jpghttp:\/\/www.shishigami.com\/srfa\/Jel_Ena\/garrett.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCGrindhouse\/events\/226260825\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Grand Opening of \u201cMagica Sexualis\u201d (Sexual Magic!)

It is a text that drifts and sinks into love and disaster, memory as wreckage, connection, performance and the ocean floor.

The creature, a brain-eating parasite called an \"Aylmer\" (but who prefers the simpler handle \"Elmer\") came calling after abandoning his former companions -- a European couple who tried to wean him from human brains by supplying him with sheep brains from the local butcher. Preferring prey of the bipedal variety (and a younger, more mobile host), Elmer hitches a ride with Brian, administering doses of a highly addictive psychedelic drug to keep him under control, and sends him out in search of human gray matter. Understandably, this drives a wedge in the relationship between Brian and his girlfriend, Barbara (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jennifer-lowry-p43549\">Jennifer Lowry<\/a>), who doesn't buy the monster story but nevertheless begins to recognize Brian's junkie behavior patterns. Fighting a losing battle against Elmer's magic juice (and trying to keep Elmer from munching down on Barbara's skull), Brian is forced into a hideous showdown for possession of his own mind.

Campos<\/p> <p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<br\/>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<br\/>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from\u00a0these Luso-African countries.<br\/>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England.\u00a0<br\/>Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<br\/>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<br\/>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<br\/>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing. A moment when the woman's beauty, enhanced by her partner, must embody all its essence. \" D.

In India in the latter half of the twenty-first century, Meena survives what she believes is an assassination attempt after discovering a snake in her bed. Fleeing this threat to her life, she decides to track down the woman responsible for the death of her parents more than a quarter-of-a-century ago in Ethiopia. Meena knows her journey won\u2019t be an easy one. She intends to travel along the Trail, a bridge used to harness energy that runs across the Arabian Sea. Years before Meena sets out on her journey, ten-year-old Mariama smuggles herself aboard a truck bound for Ethiopia. The drivers take pity on her and allow her to accompany them, but it is Yemaya, a mysterious, beautiful passenger they pick up along the way, who captures Mariama\u2019s attention and heart. More than a few surprises await Meena and Mariama and the reader as story lines converge in a surprising, gratifying climax.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s transfixing to watch Monica Byrne become a major player in sci-fi with her debut novel: so sharp, so focused and so human.

She went from auditing balance sheets to scrutinizing food labels when her daughter was diagnosed with a severe food allergy, gluten sensitivity, and an autoimmune disease.

Decision makers have a choice between business as usual, or innovative solutions that look to synergies between humans and nature. Wood is claimed to be the only truly renewable building material, simultaneously capturing carbon and conserving biodiversity as it grows. Its potential is enormous, but it is often misunderstood.<br\/>So: is wood good? What are the environmental, social, and cultural benefits\u2014or pitfalls\u2014of using wood for public and private construction projects? How can we maximize its potential as construction material, conservation tool, and cultural building block?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Speakers + Participants<br\/><\/b>Wood at Work will feature a lineup of 20 influential conservationists, foresters, industry innovators, policymakers, architects, and urban planners, including Robin Chazdon, author of Second Growth: The Promise of Tropical Forest Regeneration in an Age of Deforestation; renowned architectural historian Kenneth Frampton; World Resources Institute\u2019s Lars Laestadius; and award-winning writer John Vaillant, as well as a lineup of artists, musicians, and craftsmen. All 120 conference participants will be invited to join in discussions as well as in hands-on breakout activities such as urban tree identification, Japanese sawing demonstrations, and literary talks celebrating trees and wood.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Venue<br\/><\/b>The conference will be held at the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s world-famous Bronx Zoo, in the Schiff Family Great Hall. The Bronx Zoo is the largest metropolitan zoo in the nation, covering 265 acres of park land and naturalistic habitats through which the Bronx River flows. Manhattan events will include an urban natural areas tour and cocktail reception on Thursday evening for all participants, and dinner on Friday evening for speakers and VIPs.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Ticket Costs:<br\/><\/b>Conference Ticket: $100<br\/>Student Ticket:\u00a0$50<\/p> <p><b>Please email<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">\u00a0[masked]<\/a>\u00a0if you have any questions.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Transforming-Architectural-Practice-Meetup\/events\/226212502\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":34200000,"name":"Wood at Work 2015","id":"226212502","time":1446208200000,"updated":1446243430000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394205115000,"name":"Transforming Architectural Practice Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":13211062,"urlname":"Transforming-Architectural-Practice-Meetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07410","country":"us","city":"Fair Lawn","phone":"(201) 797-4878","address_1":"6-18 Maple Ave","name":"Rivara's Restaurant and Bar","lon":-74.141647,"id":415934,"state":"NJ","lat":40.941185,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":15.4365921021,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1429477406000,"fee":{"amount":455,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":8,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello!

After her release, she is punished and imprisoned by her family for daring to speak out and shaming their name.<\/p> <p>Unbreakable, she sets out in a search for freedom and justice in a country gripped by a dangerous power struggle. Buoyed by the other activists she meets along the way, she forges ahead despite the odds mounting against her.<\/p> <p>Hend's story mirrors the trajectory of the Arab Spring\u2014from the ecstasy of newfound courage to the agony of shattered dreams.<\/p> <p>Despite crushing setbacks, it is resilience that sustains the hope for reform for Hend and her fellow activists, even during the darkest hours of their struggle for a better Egypt.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/unanyc.org\/events\/2015\/20151030_still1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\"It has been said that the world knows little about its greatest heroes. It knows even less about its heroines,\" said director Gini Reticker. \"With the eruption of the Arab Spring, I watched with enormous curiosity as country after country joined the universal call for bread, freedom and social justice. My past experiences made me curious about the role of women in these extraordinary revolutions. I wasn't surprised to find that they not only participated in the front, but, in many cases, they were pioneers. I wanted to know more about their stories.<\/p> <p>\"During numerous scouting trips, I met woman after woman who stood in utter contrast to the stereotype of Arab women as oppressed and downtrodden. They challenged widely held assumptions about gender, religion, the veil, and political participation of women in the Arab world. In making TRIALS OF SPRING, I have come to learn that Arab women are more than powerful agents of change in their own communities. In a region gridlocked between religious and military conflict, women do not need saving; women are the saviors. They just might be the best answer to the violent radicalism that plagues the region and inspires fear and prejudice around the world.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/unanyc.org\/events\/2015\/20151030_still2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Please join us for this exclusive NYC screening of <b>THE TRIALS OF SPRING<\/b>, which had a sold-out world premiere at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival this summer.

All proceeds will support the Hoboken Jubilee Center. Bring a \"no-flame\" lantern if you have one. We'll have some cool, hand-made (of recycled material) lanterns for sale ($5) and we'll have some lights to borrow as well as some treats! $25 is the suggested donation.

These bags are made from finite fossil fuel resources such as oil and natural gas. The bags are usually given out for free by retailers and are generally used for a very brief time. Ultimately, most of them end up in landfills, trees, sewerage systems, and most disturbingly, in our oceans and other waterways. The toxins contained in them are being found in marine animals and thus in our food supply. They are decimating the aquatic ecosystem. Screening starts at 6:30 pm. Doors open at 6:00 pm. Following the 79-minute film, Jennie Romer will lead a Q&amp;A session. Ms. Romer is a national expert on plastic bag laws (see her website: <a href=\"http:\/\/plasticbaglaws.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/plasticbaglaws.org\/<\/a>).

The bill is being spearheaded by Council Members Lander and Chin and is currently before the NYC Council. It is also awaiting an answer from the Mayor on whether or not he supports it. Come hear from Jennie what lessons have been learned from other cities\u2019 efforts and how those lessons were incorporated into the proposed law for NYC. You\u2019ll also learn more about the BagItNYC coalition and their work to help encourage Mayor de Blasio and council members who have not yet signed on to support the bill. Here is a trailer (<a href=\"http:\/\/bagitmovie.com\/trailer.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bagitmovie.com\/trailer.html<\/a>) for the film.

Jeb is not a radical environmentalist, but an average American who decides to take a closer look at our cultural love affair with plastics. Jeb\u2019s journey in this documentary film starts with simple questions: Are plastic bags really necessary? What are plastic bags made from? What happens to plastic bags after they are discarded?<\/p> <p>Jeb looks beyond plastic bags and discovers that virtually everything in modern society\u2014from baby bottles, to sports equipment, to dental sealants, to personal care products\u2014is made with plastic or contains potentially harmful chemical additives used in the plastic-making process. When Jeb\u2019s journey takes a personal twist, we see how our crazy-for-plastic world has finally caught up with us and what we can do about it. Today. Right now.<\/p> <p>See you at the movies on Friday October 30, 2015.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Grassroots-Alliance\/events\/226073284\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":9000000,"name":"Fri 10\/30\/15 Free Screening of Documentary Film \"Bag It\"","id":"226073284","time":1446244200000,"updated":1446254708000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1336248260000,"name":"NYC Grassroots Alliance","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3805572,"urlname":"NYC-Grassroots-Alliance","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Allies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"221 W38th Street","name":"Tagine","lon":-73.833504,"id":23481071,"state":"NY","lat":40.782001,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.4998216629,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445876098000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Come on out this Halloween Eve and mingle with over 100 mature singles.
