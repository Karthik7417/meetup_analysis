Some of these critical services include Orientation &amp; Mobility, Rehabilitation Teaching, Assistive Technology, and accessible library services.<\/p> <p>The Governor\u2019s proposed budget for FY2017 has recommended level-funding for most of the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind (MCB) state appropriations, along with the Perkins and Worcester Library programs.<\/p> <p>The Perkins Library and the Worcester Talking Book Library \u2013 The[masked] &amp;[masked] line item accounts provide funding for the continued operations of the Perkins Library and the Worcester Talking Book Library for the delivery of audio, braille and large print accessible library services. The proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level will allow for the continuation of modest outreach to the 100,000 potentially eligible borrowers in the Commonwealth who are not aware of the program. Ongoing support for accessible library services is essential to meet expanding information and technology access needs.<br\/>MCB's Community Service account [masked]) includes funding for support for the Community Mobility and Orientation Program which provides vital travel training for clients in their home and communities. This service is provided both by MCB staff as well as the Carroll Center for the Blind. This account also supports the Deaf-Blind Community Access Network (DBCAN) providing essential independent living services to people who are deafblind. Rates for both of these services are being adjusted based on Chapter 257.<br\/>MCB's Turning 22 account [masked]) covers supports and services for more severely disabled youth who are blind or visually impaired transitioning out of the special education system as well as for their continued care as adults.<br\/>General support for the special education circuit-breaker funding for Chapter 766 school tuition rates is needed.<br\/>At this important time, the blindness community is working to both provide information and network with legislators on the need for appropriate funding for the blindness community\u2019s unique service needs.<\/p> <p>Please complete the online registration form. This will make it possible for event planners to provide you with follow-up email with additional details on this event including directions to the State House meeting room and your representative and senator\u2019s names and office locations.<\/p> <p>Please come to the State House on Thursday, March 24th and add your voice to our advocacy efforts!<\/p> <p><br\/>Program Schedule:<\/p> <p>11:30 am \u2013 12:00 pm: Light buffet lunch with legislators \/ access product demonstrations<br\/>12:00 pm \u2013 1:15 pm: Award \/ Consumer Presentations<br\/>1:15 pm \u2013 2:00 pm and beyond: Networking, walk around the State House to visit representative and senators\u2019 offices<br\/>For other questions, or to register by phone, please contact Debby King, B.L.I.N.D. 2016 Registration Coordinator, at[masked] or [masked].<\/p> <p>For any State House accommodations requests, please contact Carl Richardson by March 14, 2016 at[masked] or via email at [masked].<\/p> <p>Talking points and legislative contact information will be distributed in a future email communication prior to the event; with hard copy print and braille materials available on March 24th. If you are unable to join us on Thursday, March 24th, you can still help by contacting your elected officials.<\/p> <p>There is a new way-finding system in the State House called Click &amp; Go Maps. Using this service, one can access detailed walking directions between various landmarks both outside and inside the building, as well as descriptions of various points of interest. As an alternative to web access and free downloads of this way-finding data, access can be made via a free telephone call using interactive voice response technology.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We process billions of data points every day including metrics and events. Metrics are things like CPU utilization, database keys, queue lengths and more. Events are more varied and include completed Chef job notifications, GitHub commits, and Docker container status. Storing this information and being able to make use of it in our Stream and our Dashboards is challenging. We started with Postgres like many of you probably did. But as our needs grew, we moved to various configurations of Elastic, learning as we went. Elastic is now a core component in how we can do what we do, indexing vast numbers of events every second. In this talk, you will see how Datadog uses an Elastic cluster to create a fast and efficient environment for thousands of customers and how we keep an eye on it to ensure it stays that way.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio<br\/><\/b>Matt Williams is the DevOps Evangelist at Datadog. He is passionate about the power of monitoring and metrics to make large-scale systems stable and manageable. So he tours the country speaking and writing about monitoring with Datadog.

Our focus is to celebrate and promote Japanese animation, comics, and pop-culture.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>This event has been a cornerstone of the North East Anime Convention circuit since our inaugural event in April, 2003. Following unprecedented growth, we quickly outgrew the space in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and moved to the Hynes Convention Center in 2005. The Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston have allowed us to grow in ways we could not have imagined since the idea was first conceived.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>While the main focus on Anime Boston has always been Japanese animation and comics, we have expanded to include other aspects of Japanese pop-culture: J-Pop, J-Rock, and live-action Japanese media. We have also delved into Japanese history and traditional culture, thus encouraging people to develop a more well-rounded perspective.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Over 350 staff members work to make this convention possible. On top of that, everyone is a volunteer; no one gets paid for what they do. We all participate because we are also fans (and might be a little crazy). We work year-round to prepare for each convention; in fact, planning for the next year begins before the previous one is even over! Our staff is incredibly diverse and comes from all walks of life and experiences. The hard work and dedication of our staff members ensures that we put on the best show possible.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Of course, Anime Boston would not be the success it has become without the support of its members and fans. Starting with a staggering 4,000 members in 2003 (an incredible feat for a brand new convention), by 2012 we had expanded to welcome more than 22,000 people over the weekend. The majority of our panels are actually presented by members who just want to share their passions with the larger community. Having members organize some of the programming for Anime Boston gives everyone a sense of community and belonging at our event.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We, the staff of Anime Boston and the New England Anime Society, thank you for taking interest in our convention. Your excitement helps energize everyone and spreads the word to new people. We hope to see you there!\"<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup\/events\/229727025\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"THURSDAY PRE ANIME BOSTON 2016 MEET & GREET ITADAKIMASU DINNER","id":"229727025","time":1458856800000,"updated":1458916662000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1223061966000,"name":"The Boston Japanese Anime & Films Social Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1294353,"urlname":"BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01880","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"63 Bay State Rd","name":"Wakefield Elks","lon":-71.071768,"id":713478,"state":"MA","lat":42.527781,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":11.6164970398,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458396416000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Ladies:<\/p> <p>Come on down and enjoy some warm sociability with great prizes! \u00a0You can win over 15 prizes including spoon roasts, pork, chicken, gift certificates and even cash!<\/p> <p>I am attending the meat raffle at the Elks \u00a0and thought I'd post it as an event. \u00a0It is a fun night out with a chance to win, lobster, roast and other delicious meats.<\/p> <p>Members at our table have been pretty lucky winning, breakfast packages, spoon roasts, lobsters, steaks, cash prizes etc.<\/p> <p>Come on out and have some fun.<\/p> <p>I will meet members that would like to attend at 6:00 at the BACK DOOR inside the door (foyer). \u00a0You cannot gain entry without being escorted by a member:)<\/p> <p>Here is my phone number[masked]<\/p> <p>The raffle starts promptly at 6:30 (you need time to purchase tickets prior to raffle so please if late no later than 6:20).<\/p> <p>If you interested in learning more about the Elks it's a great opportunity to check it out, I'd be glad to give you a tour!<\/p> <p>This event may be cross posted in other meetups and therefore we may have a mixed table (men and women).<\/p> <p>Sue<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"REAR ENTRANCE RIGHT INSIDE THE DOOR","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/229712136\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Come join in the FUN.....MEAT RAFFLE - WAKEFIELD ELKS","id":"229712136","time":1458856800000,"updated":1459170550000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"219 Elm St","name":"The Painted Burro","lon":-71.121407,"id":21304172,"lat":42.394665,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":3.56010293961,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458260271000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants!

Mindful eating is about eating with awareness. Awareness helps people to have a better sense of when they are hungry and when they are full, when they overeat, what cues them to overeat, and what types of situations or environmental factors make overeating more likely to happen. Mindfully eating is typically thought of as slowing down, tasting one\u2019s food, pacing oneself and being able to appreciate food more. However, this is simply is not enough instruction for people who want more of a conscious approach to changing unhelpful eating habits.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Recently I found the book Eating the Moment by Pavel Somov, Ph.D. This book offers 141 exercises to eat mindfully. They are clever, helpful, and experiential options to increase one\u2019s awareness of eating. The mindful eating groups that I will be co-hosting will be based on these 141 exercises. My goal is to get through the entire book, but to find people who are interested in doing it with me. If you are interested in this journey, you must get the book. Every time we meet for dinner there will be 2-3 exercises to try during the week, and we will report on how they went for each of us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For this MeetUp I am asking people to read through the first part of Chapter 2, Becoming Mindful of the Process of Eating. In the paper copy, this starts on page 73. We will be focusing on The Four Aspects of Taste as well as the Subtext of Texture, and using ideas from this book to describe, taste, and categorize our food as we eat.\u00a0Remember that this is a group where participation is part of the process and there is no experiential learning if there is no experimenting\/ doing\/ trying.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please remember to bring a copy of your book to the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mindful Eating Meetups will be cohosted with other meetup groups, and will include locations on the North Shore as well as in and around Boston. We will try to meet consistently as there is more interest. That is also why the attendance may seem small or limited; because we are accommodating another group. As an FYI, this event will be mixed gender and may include men.\u00a0 In addition, here is an exercise that I would like participants to consider, in the overarching theme of awareness of ethnic diversity and food:<\/p> <p>1)\u00a0 Research the country of the ethnic food MeetUp group and make a list of current facts about the country. Consider facts that you find interesting or fascinating and share your facts with the group.<\/p> <p>2)\u00a0 Find a food or spice that the restaurant uses in its dishes and research any health benefits, uses for the food, or other interesting facts about the food. Introduce the food to the group. Share the unique aspects of this food\/ spice and\/ or recipe with the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As always, I will document people who NO SHOW as a NO SHOW and move towards not letting you attend future events.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Inn-keepers and prostitutes, kings and cardinals, artists and soldiers rub shoulders in the pages of his notorious autobiography: a vivid portrait of the manners and morals of both the rulers of the day and of their subjects. Written with supreme powers of invective and an irrepressible sense of humour, this is an unrivalled glimpse into the palaces and prisons of the Italy of Michelangelo and the Medici.<\/p> <p>Although most of Cellini's works in precious metals have been melted down, one surviving gold salt celler, which he completed for Francois I of France, and a number of major sculptures have secured his reputation as one of the finest Italian artists in the generation after Michelangelo. But he is most celebrated for his autobiography, which chronicles with unflagging energy and force one of the most tempestuous lives and one of the largest egos in all of history. Cellini served dukes, bishops, cardinals, and kings and queens of several nations, and he quarreled with them all, including two popes, one of whom, by Cellini's account, tried to murder him. He confesses to several murders himself, at least one rape, a notorious prison-break, innumerable fights and feuds. He also claims a pivotal role in defending Rome against invasion. From its first appearance in 1728 (150 years after his death), this portrait of a fanatical individualist helped define our notion of the Renaissance. The vigorous translation by John Addington Symonds is superbly realized by British narrator Robert Whitfield, successfully bringing to tape Cellini's unforgettable story.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Belmont-Non-Fiction-Book-Club\/events\/228983579\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Read The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","id":"228983579","time":1458860400000,"updated":1458872789000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383981015000,"name":"Metro West Non-Fiction Book Club","group_lon":-71.1800003052,"id":11029982,"urlname":"Belmont-Non-Fiction-Book-Club","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Non-fiction Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"297 Newbury Street","name":"cove","lon":-71.085243,"id":24407361,"state":"MA","lat":42.349125,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.08403491974,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457138356000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>DC-based cove (<a href=\"https:\/\/cove.is\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/cove.is<\/a>) expanded to Boston in 2015 and is a community of spaces and people defining new ways to be productive together. cove has flexible plans that are designed around the way you get things done.

Sex Positive Boston took February off, and now that March (SPRING!!!) is here, we are back in full awesomeness!<\/p> <p>When attending please let me (Nicole Mazzeo) know you heard about the event from the Pleasure Without Borders Meetup. Thanks!<\/p> <p><b>The Discussion Topic<\/b><\/p> <p>This edition of Sex Positive Boston will be a space to air out an social justice or sex-positive frameworks \/ messages \/ ways of doing things that have rubbed you the wrong way or left you feeling confused. You'll have a chance to explore your thoughts and feelings about the thing(s) that come(s) up for you, and hear the perspectives of other people in the group. We may disagree with each other, and that is OKAY! It will be interesting to hear how different people (who likely share similar values about sexual freedom) may have very different experiences with and reactions to certain concepts.<\/p> <p>I especially want to explore concepts that you DON'T already have a conclusion for (i.e. it feels weird to you, but you're not sure if you agree\/disagree, don't understand it enough, etc.) Let's figure this stuff out together! (Or at least explore it further, possibly without finding clear answers...) :)<\/p> <p>Here's an example to explain what I mean: I often hear people say that if you believe in gender equality, you should identify as a feminist, because the defintion of a feminist is someone who believes in gender equality. While I think this message is often coming from a good place, it doesn't really sit well with me. I see feminism as a social and political movement that has a flawed history and consists of lots of different people, many of whom might share beliefs that someone who believes in gender equality might not identify with. So I think there are plenty of legitimate reasons that a person who believes in gender equality might not want to call themself a feminist, and it might be unhelpful to demand that they use that label. (While this is my reaction, I woul love to hear and consider other people's thoughts on this.)<\/p> <p>That was just the first expample that came up for me, but this discussion is intended to be about lots of topics, not just that one. So don't worry if that one doesn't resonate with you!<\/p> <p>I have plenty of other examples that could probably fill the whole discussion, but I want to hear and explore what comes up for you!<\/p> <p>We will also ask ourselves: How do we work for a common goal (a culture of sexual acceptance) within a movement where we disagree on some things?<\/p> <p>We will also reflect on appreciating all of the good that these movements have done, while recognizing that they are not perfect.<\/p> <p><b>Show-and-Tell<\/b><\/p> <p>Following the discussion, we'll have a show-and-tell of any sexual acceptance related projects anyone is working on. Feel free to bring your project (or information on your project) for show-and-tell, if you have one.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Who should come?<\/b><\/p> <p>All are welcome. This is for people of all genders, races, ages, etc. Feel free to invite people!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Donations<\/b><\/p> <p>This is a <b>free<\/b> event.

I am as passionate about the Cuddle Party experience today, as I was the first one, over five years ago. YES! It helped me reclaim my voice and I am passionate about helping others do the same.<\/p> <p>\n\nCuddle Party experiences teach participants, they alone create their own safety container. How did it change my life? When I was growing up and received a NO, it felt like I was being rejected. The result was my emphasis on being nice, being lovable and being unconditionally available. The profound learning came when I realized my unyielding YES\u2019s became a subconscious inability to trust another person\u2019s YES, without their own personally vocalized NO!<\/p> <p>\n\nI am very appreciative and honored by the courage shown by those who have clear boundaries, and an ability to voice their YES and NO decisions without guilt, shame or fear. It gives me the confidence to ask for what my own heart desires, instead of censoring myself, knowing the receiver of my request has the voice and courage to embrace or withdraw, based on their own perimeters. \u201cThank you for taking care of your self\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\nAfter the Welcome Circle, Reid will offer a mini version of his speed flirting class, to help break the ice and dive us into getting to know one another.<\/p> <p>\n\nSpeed-Flirting is a rambunctious, social event for men, women, humans of all ages.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

(RSVPs on MeetUp do not reflect accurate registration numbers, nor do they secure your spot.) Come join us in Boston as two top teachers in the fields of sexuality, vulnerability, and self-acceptance weave their diverse perspectives into a weekend retreat like you have never experienced before.<\/p> <p>Enigmatic comedian Reid Mihalko will show you ways to simplify your life, lessen emotional paperwork, and face your fears with humor and confidence.<\/p> <p>Monique Darling, mistress of the weave, Goddess of self acceptance, will open you to an immense playground of possibilities you had not dared to consider. And will bring together the juiciest morsels of various teachers to help you internalize the lessons to your depths, and to help you find the greatest love of your life. Yourself.<\/p> <p>Benefit from the blending of their unique experiences, approaches, and insights regarding skillful communication to get to your no without fear to uncover your yes, releasing your armor and becoming more vulnerable to discover an inner strength you did not know you have, and the ability to laugh in the face of your greatest fears.<\/p> <p>If you could have anything, do anything, what would you choose? What do you really want? What is keeping you from having it? Is someone else better qualified? better looking? more financially stable? Do you have \u201cproblems\u201d? What if every limit you have, every chain that binds you, is only there because you believe it is? What if the limits disappear, the chains dissolve?. Your life is alive with an abundance of possibilities, opportunities, and potential all you have to do is be willing to say \"yes\".<\/p> <p><br\/>So much of the fear and hesitation in life comes not from the self, but from fretting about what others may think,or what they will say or whom they might share it with afterwards rather than being able to enjoy the moment. Another set of fears come from passed-down beliefs that we accept without questioning them.<\/p> <p>What if you could make decisions and follow your heart...follow your body and your desires without worrying about what others thought? What if you were fearless in relating \u2013 first, to yourself and then, to others?<\/p> <p>We all have feelings of ferocity and tenderness, but we must feel safe in order to be vulnerable and intimate with another. Part of that safety is being confident in our own ability to say \u2018NO\u2019 and take a stand for our boundaries. Only then can we play in the realm of our true \u2018HELL YES!\u2019<\/p> <p>Come join us for a unique weekend of exploration around such topics as:<\/p> <p>*How do we establish boundaries and create safe space for ourselves to explore with others? *Shifting paradigms from blame, shame, guilt &amp; judgement, to love, acceptance, understanding and presence.<\/p> <p>*Factors that promote or inhibit intimacy:<\/p> <p>*The power of no and boundary (understand why your \u201cno\u201d says more about you than your \u201cyes\u201d)<\/p> <p>In this workshop you will learn, play, and practice: - To ask for what you want, skillfully, without attachment to the response.<\/p> <p>- To honor, respect, and be grateful for the answer \u201cno\u201d, and still be hopeful for the answer \u201cyes\u201d.<\/p> <p>- To be honest and vulnerable about your wants and desires without shame, without deflection, without armor.<\/p> <p>- To hold space for someone who has not yet learned these skills.<\/p> <p>- To own your fears, instead of them owning you.<\/p> <p>- To not be afraid to be the one who loves the most<\/p> <p>- To learn to be even more vulnerable when you want to isolate or close down.<\/p> <p>- Release shame and haunting memories<\/p> <p>- Modalities of communication: verbal and non verbal<\/p> <p>You will gain tools and leave with the ability to relate with everyone in your life with more ease, grace, and blissful contentment from your own center.<\/p> <p>SECURE YOUR TICKET HERE:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/fearlessweekendma.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/fearlessweekendma.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Are you confused about dating, mating, and relating in the 21st Century?<\/p> <p>Dating, marriage and the reasons we stay in relationships have changed a lot since the days of our great grandparents.

The last two stages enable all this energy to flow vertically, to move upward into silence.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Instructions<\/b>:<\/p> <p>The meditation is one hour long, with four stages.<\/p> <p><b><i>First Stage: 15 minutes<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Be loose and let your whole body shake, feeling the energies moving up from your feet. Let go everywhere and become the shaking. Your eyes may be open or closed.<\/p> <p><b><i>Second Stage: 15 minutes<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Dance ... any way you feel, and let the whole body move as it wishes.

And will bring together the juiciest\u00a0morsels of various teachers to help you internalize the lessons to your depths, and to help you find the greatest love of your life. Yourself.<\/p> <p>\n\nCome and benefit from the blending of their unique experiences, approaches, and insights regarding skillful communication to get to your no without fear to uncover your yes, releasing your armor and becoming more vulnerable to discover an inner strength you did not know you have, and the ability to laugh in the face of your greatest fears.<\/p> <p>\n\n----------<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAre you ready to take an intensive weekend of FEARLESS RELATING with two of the most dynamic relationship geeks on the planet today? Come blow your mind and open your heart with vulnerability diva Monique Darling, and sex and relationship expert Reid Mihalko.<\/p> <p>\n\nIf you could have anything, do anything, what would you choose? What do you really want? What is keeping you from having it? Is someone else better qualified? better looking? more financially stable? Do you have \u201cproblems\u201d? What if every limit you have, every chain that binds you, is only there because you believe it is? What if the limits disappear, the chains dissolve?. Your life is alive with an abundance of possibilities, opportunities, and potential all you have to do is be willing to say \"yes\".<\/p> <p>\n\nSo much of the fear and hesitation in life comes not from the self, but from fretting about what others may think,or what they will say or whom they might share it with afterwards rather than being able to enjoy the moment. Another set of fears come from passed-down beliefs that we accept without questioning them.<\/p> <p>\n\nWhat if you could make decisions and follow your heart...follow your body and your desires without worrying about what others thought? What if you were fearless in relating \u2013 first, to yourself and then, to others?<\/p> <p>\n\nWe all have feelings of ferocity and tenderness, but we must feel safe in order to be vulnerable and intimate with another. Part of that safety is being confident in our own ability to say \u2018NO\u2019 and take a stand for our boundaries. Only then can we play in the realm of our true \u2018HELL YES!\u2019<\/p> <p>\n\nCome join us for a unique weekend of exploration around such topics as:<\/p> <p><br\/>*How do we establish boundaries and create safe space for ourselves to explore with others?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>*Shifting paradigms from blame, shame, guilt &amp; judgement, to love, acceptance, understanding and presence.<\/p> <p><br\/>*Factors that promote or inhibit intimacy:<\/p> <p><br\/>*The power of no and boundary (understand why your \u201cno\u201d says more about you than your \u201cyes\u201d)<\/p> <p>\n\nIn this workshop you will learn, play, and practice:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>To ask for what you want, skillfully, without attachment to the response.<\/p> <p><br\/>To honor, respect, and be grateful for the answer \u201cno\u201d, and still be hopeful for the answer \u201cyes\u201d.<\/p> <p><br\/>To be honest and vulnerable about your wants and desires without shame, without deflection, without armor.<\/p> <p><br\/>To hold space for someone who has not yet learned these skills.<\/p> <p><br\/>To own your fears, instead of them owning you.<\/p> <p><br\/>To not be afraid to be the one who loves the most<\/p> <p><br\/>To learn to be even more vulnerable when you want to isolate or close down.<\/p> <p><br\/>Release shame and haunting memories<\/p> <p><br\/>Modalities of communication: verbal and non verbal<\/p> <p>\n\nYou will gain tools and leave with the ability to relate with everyone in your life with more ease, grace, and blissful contentment from your own center.<\/p> <p>\n\nSign up for the Love Exchange $397<\/p> <p><br\/>Or be one of the first 3 to sign up and get all 3 days for $299\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>SECURE YOUR TICKET HERE:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffearlessweekendma.eventbrite.com%2F&amp;h=uAQFH4uU2&amp;enc=AZODU3XbIteqWLWV0fK0F8tzCysxFrTxBZWqxIgh7Ng7T3znRN_-g0dLZYUfUJ2KIPw&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fearlessweekendma.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/fearlessweekendma.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAre you confused about dating, mating, and relating in the 21st Century?<\/p> <p><br\/>Dating, marriage and the reasons we stay in relationships have changed a lot since the days of our great grandparents.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Join us for this humorous, frank and informative, intensive workshop where sex and relationship expert Reid Mihalko boils down over 150,000 conversations he\u2019s had about sex and relationships and walks us through his best thinking and advice on making sex, dating, relationships and mating work!<\/p> <p><br\/>Participants will leave this interactive workshop experience discovering:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Tools to determine if someone is a good or horrible fit for you\u2026<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Communication Skills to ask for what they want and how to avoid past relationship mistakes\u2026<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 A few of Reid\u2019s and Monique\u2019s \u201cblack belt\u201d relationship tips and tricks!<\/p> <p>\n\nThen, let Monique Darling, Consent Geek Extraordinaire, lead you through all of the tools, tips, tricks and how to uplevel the questions you are asking yourself and others to truly be able to find and live from your own \"Hell Yes\"!!

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. This spring event is for evening people, the best time is an hour after sunset looking WEST. That makes it best to be found on the west coast, but can possibly be done in the east in dark spaces without cities west of you.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. When looking west, the light slants to the left (south):<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/3\/6\/600_446569462.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Below is a shot from October's light looking east. <img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/3\/5\/600_446468245.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise or the western horizon in spring. Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during astronomical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time in spring then is between 8 and 9 p.m. during the period 25-March to 7-April, before that it is too bright (sunset is around 7:00 p.m., in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in April, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 25-Mar to 7-Apr (and again 24-Apr to 6-May). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due West (270\u00b0) to about 280\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\">Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google:<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p> <p><br\/>Suggested locations: west of Springfield or Deerfield, elevated location are dark. Mt Greylock may work, but has the glow of Albany due west.

Our focus is to celebrate and promote Japanese animation, comics, and pop-culture.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>This event has been a cornerstone of the North East Anime Convention circuit since our inaugural event in April, 2003. Following unprecedented growth, we quickly outgrew the space in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and moved to the Hynes Convention Center in 2005. The Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston have allowed us to grow in ways we could not have imagined since the idea was first conceived.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>While the main focus on Anime Boston has always been Japanese animation and comics, we have expanded to include other aspects of Japanese pop-culture: J-Pop, J-Rock, and live-action Japanese media. We have also delved into Japanese history and traditional culture, thus encouraging people to develop a more well-rounded perspective.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Over 350 staff members work to make this convention possible. On top of that, everyone is a volunteer; no one gets paid for what they do. We all participate because we are also fans (and might be a little crazy). We work year-round to prepare for each convention; in fact, planning for the next year begins before the previous one is even over! Our staff is incredibly diverse and comes from all walks of life and experiences. The hard work and dedication of our staff members ensures that we put on the best show possible.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Of course, Anime Boston would not be the success it has become without the support of its members and fans. Starting with a staggering 4,000 members in 2003 (an incredible feat for a brand new convention), by 2012 we had expanded to welcome more than 22,000 people over the weekend. The majority of our panels are actually presented by members who just want to share their passions with the larger community. Having members organize some of the programming for Anime Boston gives everyone a sense of community and belonging at our event.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We, the staff of Anime Boston and the New England Anime Society, thank you for taking interest in our convention. Your excitement helps energize everyone and spreads the word to new people. We hope to see you there!\"<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup\/events\/229727138\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"FRIDAY ANIME BOSTON 2016 ITADAKIMASU DINNER","id":"229727138","time":1458950400000,"updated":1458962198000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1223061966000,"name":"The Boston Japanese Anime & Films Social Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1294353,"urlname":"BostonJapaneseAnimeFilmSocialGroup","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"29 Rockingham Street ","name":"Diamond Way Buddhist Center Boston","lon":-71.11113,"id":17983412,"state":"MA","lat":42.355831,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.12402319908,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1418581001000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come meditate with us every Tuesday and Friday at 8pm in our beautiful public meditation center.

He is deeply flawed, but Shreli imbues Elvis with unquestionable pathos even as his desperation graduates into irreversible criminality.

You will receive an attunement that will permanently open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy TherapyBasic Level Ray. The Basic Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 1st pair (physical) and 2nd pair (emotional) of your 12-strand DNA. Once attuned to the Basic Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to clear cellular memory, as described below.\u00a0 You will also both give and receive a full IET treatment session during this class.\u00a0 IET sessions work well on their own or when combined with other modalities such as Reiki or massage.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Clearing Cellular Memory:<\/b><br\/>You will learn about the nine cellular memory areas where we unconsciously store traumas, stress, limiting beliefs, and patterns that can negatively affect our well-being. After energy blocks are cleared, you will learn to channel angelic energy to form an empowerment imprint that fills the cellular memory with the opposite of what you cleared. For example, you will learn to clear the energy of anger &amp; resentment and imprint the energy of forgiveness.<\/p> <p><b>Class Fee:<\/b>\u00a0(Includes handbook, printed certificate, and registration with the Center of Being)\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>$190 if registered by 3\/16\/16 (save $15)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$205 if registered after 3\/16\/16<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Review Fee:<\/b>\u00a0$95.00 if repeating class (Please bring handbook)<br\/><b>CE hours:<\/b>\u00a08.0 NCBTMB CE Contact Hours<br\/><b>Place:<\/b>\u00a0Circles of Wisdom (90 Main Street, Andover MA)<\/p> <p><b>Registration<br\/>Call Circles of Wisdom at[masked] or use this\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.circlesofwisdom.com\/workshops\/events-workshops\/sp\/basic-level-integrated-energy-therapy\/\">link<\/a>\u00a0to register online.\u00a0This class is advertised in multiple places and limited to 10 students.

She will discuss filing taxes during and after divorce, as well as hidden income.<\/p> <p>This event is casual\/interactive and not formal, which is a setting that prior attendees have really liked. We sit in a circle and the attendees have the opportunity to ask questions in the group setting, as well as ask the professionals questions one on one during the mix and mingle time towards the end. At this event, there will also be divorce attorney and mediator, David Kellem, and financial advisors, Bob Vona and Samantha Steer, to answer your questions.<\/p> <p>When: Thursday March 24th 6:30 \u2013 8:30 p.m. &amp; Saturday March 26th 12 \u2013 2 p.m. Both dates are the same event (Meetups listed separately).

This exhibition is the first major museum retrospective of works by Tseng Kwong Chi [masked]), a prolific artist and key documentarian of Manhattan's downtown scene in the 1980s. In combining photography with performance, personal identity with global politics, and satire with farce, Tseng created a compelling body of work whose complexity is belied by its easy humor and grace.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Performing for the Camera<\/b> features over 80 photo-based works alongside archival materials by the Hong Kong\u2013born artist, who died in 1990 at the age of 39 from AIDS\u2013related complications. In addition to works from the artist's best-known <i>East Meets West <\/i>and <i>Expeditionary <\/i>series and nine images of his close friend Keith Haring's drawings in New York city subways, <b>Tseng Kwong Chi: Performing for the Camera<\/b> presents over 60 examples from less well-known bodies of work.<\/p> <p>For his landmark <i>East Meets West <\/i>series, begun in 1979, Tseng adopted the identity of a visiting Chinese official, wearing a deadpan expression and a \u201cMao suit.\u201d Describing himself as both an \u201cambiguous ambassador\u201d and an \u201cinquisitive traveler,\u201d he assumed the role of a dedicated tourist crisscrossing the globe, always an outsider in a foreign land. These strikingly formal yet performance- based images feature the artist posing before popular tourist sites, such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, or Mount Rushmore, and in magnificent natural settings in the Canadian Rockies and Grand Canyon. By embarking on his own version of a Grand Tour, Tseng was determined to find and identify what was quintessentially American. In another guise, he was an eager and reliable witness to his time, documenting not only his friend Keith Haring's subway drawings but also downtown New York's lively art and nightclub scenes of the 1980s.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the lobby","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonArtEnthusiasts\/events\/229769585\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Free Exhibit and Discussion at Tufts University Art Gallery","id":"229769585","time":1459015200000,"updated":1459027376000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221166586000,"name":"Boston Art Enthusiasts","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1280431,"urlname":"BostonArtEnthusiasts","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Art Exhibit Exthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"32 Quincy St","name":"Harvard Art Museums","lon":-71.114433,"id":23784133,"state":"MA","lat":42.374737,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.49156069756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456420205000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Buses replace trains today between Alewife and Harvard Sq.<\/p> <p>Art plus M &amp; M = win win!

A puja is a ceremony to practice the path of tantra. In the East, puja is a celebration of the Divine, an honoring ceremony for a God or a Goddess, and those somewhere in between ;) In the West, we also celebrate the Divine, the divine in each of us. A puja is a group of people like you, open to celebrating heart felt interactions. During a puja we pair up with partners and practice different exercises that are designed to open our hearts, and deeper connect with ourselves and with others. It is an evening that will nurture your body, heart and spirit.<\/p> <p><br\/>This will be Boston's first 3way puja! You will have the unique opportunity to do the stations (exercises) in groups of 3. Monique and Reid will sprinkle in tools, tidbits, and tips on how to navigate successful threeways, and we will pull us down into a deep dive to experience every station to its fullest.<\/p> <p><br\/>You are can come by yourself, with a partner, or with a couple of partners!

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front.

On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there. My telephone # is[masked]-1526. Those letting me know that they can't make a day ahead of time won't be considered a no show.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your ongoing support.

Since the publication of Corporation Nation (2000) and the 1999 Seattle protests, Derber has become a prominent national commentator on corporate social responsibility and US foreign policy as well as globalization and its discontents. Interestingly, Trump and Sanders seem to be attracting the same white working class voters. In this talk, Professor Derber will look at the structural, cultural and ideological crosscurrrents shaping the election, including the shift of the GOP toward neo-Fascism, the spectacular rise of a socialist Democratic candidate, and the ways in which right and left populism are resonating to voters, especially white working class folks.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Social-Justice-League\/events\/229842300\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":16200000,"name":"Brunch and Lecture: Fascism, Socialism, and the Working Class Voter","id":"229842300","time":1459089000000,"updated":1459106473000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1458761602000,"name":"Boston Social Justice League","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19749270,"urlname":"Boston-Social-Justice-League","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01923","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Danvers","address_1":"161 Elliott Street","name":"Danversport Yacht Club","lon":-70.91745,"id":12130692,"state":"MA","lat":42.557865,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":15.7598562241,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456246272000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Anyone interested in joining me for brunch on Easter?

I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Outside Court, location with yellow railings!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewEnglandParkour\/events\/229464920\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":2700000,"name":"[Boston] Parkour 101 - Introduction to Parkour \/\/ Trial Class","id":"229464920","time":1459094400000,"updated":1459098954000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284132267000,"name":"New England Parkour and Free Running Group","group_lon":-71.1900024414,"id":1704666,"urlname":"NewEnglandParkour","group_lat":41.9700012207,"who":"Traceurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"01754","address_1":"8 Waltham Street, Maynard, MA","name":"Excelsior Comics and Games","lon":0,"id":23786125,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":24.5682811737,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429814818000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/5\/2\/600_436651314.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come and join us for open board gaming at Excelsior! \u00a0They have a large gaming area to seat approximately 50 gamers in addition to a growing board game library that patrons may take right off the library shelf and play at-will. \u00a0They have also dedicated their Sunday schedule for just this open board gaming event, so us board gamers will have the pick of the tables during the entirety of the event which happens to run the entire time the shop is open on Sundays.<\/p> <p>Attendees are welcome to bring in their own games or use games from the library. \u00a0Bobby will also run game demos during the event in case you want to learn a new game or simply\u00a0try before you buy.<\/p> <p>In case you are interested in purchasing the game from the demo session, Excelsior will offer 10% off the price of purchasing a new copy of that game that day on top of the 10% discount they are offer to all MBG members (for a total discount of 20% off). \u00a0If for some reason they are out of stock of the demo game and must special order it for you that day, they will order it for you and allow you to take an additional 10% special order discount on top of the previous two discounts for a total discount of 30% off!<\/p> <p>Want to special order something that is not the demo game?

Our personal awakening process has never been this supported. Join us this Sunday for Judy's guided journey to the top of Calvary, where you will experience a felt sense of your own resurrection phase.<\/p> <p>This is an ongoing weekly (donation only) class for anyone, offering experiential practice in meditation, along with an opportunity to be among others interested in deepening spiritual practices. \u00a0The class provides you with a felt sense of your own divinity; your Higher Self. The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0 This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter at The Hawthorne Building, the large glass doors to the left of H&R Block.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group\/events\/229369432\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":4500000,"name":"Sunday meditation: journey to Calvary and your personal resurrection","id":"dfdktkyvfbkc","time":1459112400000,"updated":1459117940000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1232459353000,"name":"The Salem MA Meditation Meetup Group","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":1362498,"urlname":"The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge ","address_1":"Porter Square ","name":"PRIVATE HOME IN PORTER SQUARE","lon":-71.1194,"id":24119774,"lat":42.388855,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":3.2211163044,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1454634397000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join me for Easter Sunday dinner of a handmade semolina cavatelli and lamb ragu.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

A particular sequence of As, Cs, Gs, or Ts can indicate a growing tumor, a predisposition to a serious disease much later in life, or nothing at all. As millions of people get their genome sequenced, physicians and researchers as well as the individuals themselves will want to ask questions of these data. To ask questions we need a consistent naming scheme for parts of the genome. To address this we invented tiling\u2014a technique that divides the genome into about 10 million overlapping, variable-length sequences, or \"tiles,\" defined by their starting and ending unique 24-base tags. We will use examples from public data to show that tiling supports simple and consistent names, annotation, queries, machine learning, and clinical screening. Someday soon you may get to know the tiles in your own genome, and your doctor may use the information to realize precision medicine.<\/p> <p>Part of the DNA lecture series. A larger, one-day public symposium on the topic, \"The Past, Present, and Future of DNA,\" took place on Friday, October 2, 2015.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast\/events\/228736032\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"The Genome of YOU ...","id":"228736032","time":1459197900000,"updated":1459210284000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164140077000,"name":"The Cambridge Moveable Feast","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":370532,"urlname":"Cambridge-Moveable-Feast","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Citizens of the World"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692537784576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458926939000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Release Date:<\/p> <p>April 01, 2016<\/p> <p><br\/>Rating:<\/p> <p>R<\/p> <p><br\/>Synopsis:<\/p> <p>A \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d to Dazed and Confused set in the world of 1980 college life, Everybody Wants Some!! is a comedy that follows a group of friends as they navigate their way through the freedoms and responsibilities of unsupervised adulthood.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering.

Ferrante\u2019s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship.<\/p> <p>The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Growing up on these tough streets the two girls learn to rely on each other ahead of anyone or anything else. As they grow, as their paths repeatedly diverge and converge, Elena and Lila remain best friends whose respective destinies are reflected and refracted in the other. They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists, the unforgettable Elena and Lila.<\/p> <p>Ferrante is the author of three previous works of critically acclaimed fiction: <i>The Days of Abandonment, Troubling Love<\/i>, and <i>The Lost Daughter<\/i>. With this novel, the first in a tetralogy, she proves herself to be one of Italy\u2019s great storytellers. She has given her readers a masterfully plotted page-turner, abundant and generous in its narrative details and characterizations, that is also a stylish work of literary fiction destined to delight her many fans and win new readers to her fiction.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/227496427\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":3600000,"name":"North Shore Book Club","id":"227496427","time":1459206000000,"updated":1459260171000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"290 Main Street","name":"Cosi","lon":-71.085854,"id":19455362,"state":"MA","lat":42.362373,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.827825188637,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445544170000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is our brand new\u00a0<b>auxiliary\u00a0<\/b>meetup event. \u00a0This is a great opportunity to socialize and play games in a relaxed environment -- and best of all, there's no cap on attendance.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/8\/600_436680296.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are a casual group of people who enjoy playing\u00a0<b>complex\u00a0<\/b>board games -- the kind of board games that\u00a0make you think.\u00a0We play a variety of games, but the games at this particular event are going to be\u00a0<b>on the smaller side<\/b>\u00a0-- because those are often the games that work best in a cafe setting.<\/p> <p>Our main meetup requires RSVPs due to heavy popularity and finite space. \u00a0This event runs simultaneously, two buildings away. \u00a0<b>RSVPs are NOT required for this event.<\/b>\u00a0 RSVPs are still appreciated so the event hosts know how many people to expect, but you don't need to update them and can come even if you don't RSVP.<\/p> <p>This event takes place once a week\u00a0(alternating Mondays and Wednesdays), from 7:00 - 9:30 or 10. \u00a0Cosi closes at 10, but <b>after 9:30,\u00a0<\/b>you are welcome to come and join the regular meetup at that point,\u00a0no RSVP required.<\/p> <p>Cosi Cafe has graciously allowed us to use their back seating area every week. \u00a0You are not required to buy anything from them, but their food is honestly pretty good, so please take advantage of them if you are hungry for dinner, soft drinks, or snacks.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/b\/600_436680299.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We play whatever people bring, but you don't have to bring anything -- the hosts will always have a bag of games with them! \u00a0Some games that you might expect to see here include:<\/p> <p><i>Red 7, Love Letter, Codenames, Pictomania, The Resistance, Avalon, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Bang!, Glory to Rome, Innovation, Mottainai, Chrononaughts, Time Lines, Tash-Kalar<\/i><\/p> <p>If you're looking for longer or larger Euros (like 7 Wonders, Puerto Rico, or Terra Mystica), check out our regular \"Game Night\" meetup.<\/p> <p>If you haven't played these kind of games before, but think you'll like them, you're welcome too! \u00a0But be aware that you are\u00a0<b>NOT\u00a0<\/b>likely to find traditional American games (like Monopoly, Sorry, Risk, or Poker); heavy strategy or negotiation games (like 18xx, wargames, or Diplomacy); or pure abstract games (like Chess).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/9\/600_436680297.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>OUTBOUND (from Boston \/ from Park Street)<\/b><br\/>Take the Red Line to Kendall Square station.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/229786733\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvfblc","time":1459207800000,"updated":1459262066000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":15.1298618317,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426045854000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Oneness Blessing (also known as Deeksha which is Sanskrit for \"blessing\" or \"benediction\") is the transfer of intelligent sacred energy - Divine Grace - which causes the heart to flower, heals relationships, quiets the constant chatter of the mind, opens the door to higher states of awareness and initiates a process of permanent awakening into Oneness where there is no longer a sense of separation and personal suffering. All that remains is causeless love, joy and peace in the present moment.<\/p> <p>\n\nWe start the circle the Chakra Dhyana followed by the Oneness Blessings. We allow time for integration of the blessings and sharing.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Chakra Dhyana is an ancient technique from Tibet and India. It helps to enliven kundalini, a latent spiritual energy which when awakened flows through the Chakras, opening up higher dimensions in human consciousness. The meditation helps to expand consciousness in a way which relaxes the mind, balances the emotions and rejuvenates the body. The meditation includes the chanting of powerful mantras, including the \"bija mantras\" (or seed sounds) for the chakras, and a visualization of kundalini energy as a golden fluid flowing into the chakras.<\/p> <p>Oneness Blessing is free, donations accepted for the use of the Wings Studio at Roots and Wings.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Roots and Wings 317 N.

Quincy moved to LA from Seattle to pursue a career in stand-up four years ago. Within his seven years of stand-up experience, Quincy has toured the country and played the best stages in LA, including shows with comedy legends like Bill Burr. In 2013 Quincy Jones was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame (while our Quincy was drinking a Chai with almond milk in a Korea Town coffee shop). On July 3, 2015 Quincy was diagnosed with stage-four Mesothelioma cancer. He was given one year to live. Quincy is currently not strong enough to work his regular barista day job; his energy can only last a few hours at a time. On nights that he is feeling well he makes sure to hit the stages around Los Angeles, spreading laughter, as he preps for this stand-up special film shoot. While on stage, Quincy is cancer free.<\/p> <p>Quincy will be filming his one hour comedy special at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles on April 4, 2016. We at CitySide Comedy Club are thrilled and honored to have Quincy headline in preparation for the special.<\/p> <p>This show is 100% FREE, but you can reserve a seat here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cityside-comedy-club-free-every-monday-at-cityside-bar-tickets-21040783550\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/cityside-comedy-club-free-every-monday-at-cityside-bar-tickets-21040783550<\/a><\/p> <p>Every Monday CitySide Comedy Club brings you the absolute best standup comics working today.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

no limits!\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Thanks to the efficiency and BI (business intelligence) of Fair Foods of Dorchester (FairFoods.org), founded about 35 years ago by self-reported vegetarian Nancy Jamison, we have way more than AMPLE food for any intended audiences, and the operation is bettered if MORE people take the food than if FEWER take the food.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is\u00a0NO QUALIFICATION\u00a0(no test of need) and\u00a0no limit to how much you can cart off\u00a0(just pay $2\/bag).\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's why it's posted on a\u00a0meetup\u00a0like this (not merely on a volunteer meetup).\u00a0<\/p> <p>* There are tens of thousands of college students who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.\u00a0<br\/>*\u00a0There are tens of thousands (myriads) of homemakers and working individuals\u00a0who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.\u00a0<br\/>*\u00a0Lots and lots of seniors AND needy folks, and there's no operational shame in prudent fiscal management if you know that you can get quality produce at a far lower price.\u00a0<\/p> <p>[The snag is that, unlike in grocery stores - or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items - about 5-8 different vegetables and 2-3 fruits, and you're often 'gifted' with extra items - 30 ounce jug of fresh hummus or lentil salad or chickpea salads, pound of garlic, large one-lb plastic container of ground pepper, or lots of other 'big items' we don't typically buy.]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Make us busy -

These are tennis players who love the sport and joined the program to meet up with you on the courts. The Partner Program is less competitive as there are no champions crowned and no league standings. The program provides dedicated tennis partners who want to meet up with you on the courts.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0TennisNorthEast's tennis partner program is broken down to these playing regions: Boston - Brookline,\u00a0 Boston - Cambridge,\u00a0 Metro North,\u00a0 Metro South,\u00a0 Metro West - Burlington,\u00a0 Metro West - Framingham,\u00a0 Metro West - Newton,\u00a0 North Shore.<\/p> <p>\u00a0The partner program is a monthly subscription service. The Partner Program is ongoing and remains open as long as the weather is good enough to play outdoor tennis. This is NOT a doubles program.<\/p> <p><b>Your Task-\"Scheduling and Meeting up with the other players\"<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 You meet up with the players to play either a match or just hit around. TennisNorthEast's objective to ensure players are actively playing. We try to use an incentive system to push players along. Anyone who plays 3 different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service for free.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The league strongly suggests that players jointly choose a tennis court location convenient to both. We now geo-locate your program contacts which means you should receive partners closer to your preferred playing location. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> for each area, including details such as # of courts, lighting, hitting walls and links to google maps for directions. Members can submit court ratings on the overall condition, surface, lighting quality, facility management, and general comments regarding specific courts. This will provide players with up-to-date court information on new and existing courts. We encourage members to keep this list fresh and up-to-date.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The Partner Program is for all level players. We encourage beginners to play in the Partner Program prior to playing in a league. We track the results of the Partner Program and may make skill rating adjustments based upon scores if necessary. Our program ensures fun, well-matched tennis partners for players of all levels.<br\/>Admin Note: This program typically has players from 2.0 to 3.5+ level enrolled. In most locations 4.0 and 4.5+ level players will not find this program worthwhile.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The cost will be no greater than $9\/month to participate in the program. Any player that plays 3 or more different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service at no cost. In some *NEW* cities the program will be free as we are trying to build a dedicated tennis playing community.

Atmel guides the millions of Makers from getting started on the open source Arduino platforms based on Atmel microcontrollers (MCUs), to spreading the word through its millions of digital followers, all the way to getting it to market and transferring to Atmel\u2019s professional integrated development platform.<\/p> <p>\n\nAtmel Studio 7 features seamless one-click import of projects created in the Arduino development environment. Your sketch, including any libraries it references, will be imported into Studio 7 as a C++ project. Once imported, you can leverage the full capabilities of Studio 7 to fine-tune and debug your design.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Atmel\u00ae Studio 7 has been updated to use the 2015 version of the Visual Studio Shell, enhancing not only the look and feel of the integrated development environment (IDE) but also the performance when working with large projects.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Atmel Studio 7 is FREE of charge and is integrated with Atmel Software Framework (ASF) \u2013 a large library of source code and project examples. ASF strengthens Studio 7 by providing, in the same environment, access to ready-to-use code that minimizes much of the low level design required for projects.<\/p> <p>The Atmel Software Framework, integrated into Atmel Studio 7, is a collection of production-ready source code, including 1,600 ready-to-use project examples, written and optimized by experts and tested in hundreds of production designs. Use these peripheral drivers, communication stacks and application-specific libraries to quickly and easily complete your projects.<br\/>The Atmel Software Framework works across all Atmel\u00ae | SMART ARM\u00ae-based, AVR UC3, AVR XMEGA\u00ae and megaAVR\u00ae devices and with both GNU and IAR C compilers. It supports over 300 Atmel microcontrollers, including more than 60 ARM Cortex\u00ae-M processor-based devices.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Innovation-Hub-Community\/events\/229437915\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":10800000,"name":"Maker to MarketPlace Hands-On Workshop","id":"229437915","time":1459287000000,"updated":1459305101000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454949781000,"name":"Innovation Hub Innovators","group_lon":-71.3000030518,"id":19539335,"urlname":"Innovation-Hub-Community","group_lat":42.6300010681,"who":"Innovators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02043","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hingham","address_1":"1217 Main St","lon":-70.88538,"phone":"781-749-8200","name":"Scarlet Oak Tavern","id":385248,"state":"MA","lat":42.176247,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.8529815674,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457746752000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/c\/600_447722572.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/f\/b\/600_447722555.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Whether you own a small business or represent a larger company, come to meet your fellow MEETUP members who are either self employed or work for for \"the Man\" .... or \"the Woman\"\u00a0 we're equal opportunity entrepreneurs !<\/p> <p>This event is also open to members who might want to come meet those with the entrepreneurial spirit.\u00a0 Many of you have told me that you might be interested in starting your own business.

Real-time analytics are becoming increasingly important to understanding how users are using your mobile applications, and the amount of data created by mobile devices is increasing rapidly. In this talk, you'll learn how Answers leverages the lambda architecture and probabilistic algorithms to handle this torrent of information. We'll dive into how Answers uses Twitter\u2019s new stream-processing technology, Heron, to efficiently process all that information with improved reliability, performance, and operability compared to other stream processing technologies. We\u2019ll give a personal account of migrating from using Storm to using Heron for processing mobile events and the benefits we\u2019ve seen so far.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Note: Press is not admitted into these events; please e-mail\u00a0[masked]\u00a0if you have any questions.

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward so we can stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues together as a community. We have seen a surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Considering a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas. We hope you'll come to this session willing to share your thoughts and knowledge on the events of the past month. If not, feel free to listen, learn, and participate in some really important conversations.

Having accomplished a near miracle with Life After Life, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on Life\u2019s heroine Ursula Todd\u2019s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he\u2019s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can\u2019t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (\u201cViola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,\u201d Teddy thinks. \u201cThey should have aimed better.\u201d) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the \u201cfact\u201d of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula\u2019s demise(s). (\u201cHe had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.\u201d) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who\u2019ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn\u2019t fear they\u2019re missing the joke. There\u2019s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, A God in Ruins is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group\/events\/229492214\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Literature and Libations - A God in Ruins by Kate Atkinson","id":"229492214","time":1459292400000,"updated":1459354874000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246242470000,"name":"Cambridge Book Club","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1481208,"urlname":"Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lowell","address_1":"47 Lee St","name":"Lowell Makes","lon":-71.309738,"id":13811472,"state":"MA","lat":42.64629,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":2,"headcount":0,"distance":23.2941532135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1456083126000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/wood-bowl-turning-workshop-tickets-21973731021\"><a href=\"https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fimg.evbuc.com%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fcdn.evbuc.com%252Fimages%252F18891736%252F24265248004%252F1%252Foriginal.jpg%3Frect%3D70%252C0%252C310%252C155%26s%3D96ad3c5c690f04de22f8b18f3b45ea8f?h=200&amp;w=450&amp;s=5b0de52cd32390707ba22d01469317b1\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/img.evbuc.com\/https%3A%2F%2Fimg.evbuc.com%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fcdn.evbuc.com%252Fimages%252F18891736%252F24265248004%252F1%252Foriginal.jpg%3Frect%3D70%252C0%252C310%252C155%26s%3D96ad3c5c690f04de22f8b18f3b45ea8f?h=200&amp;w=450&amp;s=5b0de52cd32390707ba22d01469317b1<\/a><\/a> TICKETS MUST BE PURCHASED THROUGH EVENTBRITE.

Ave., Cambridge<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Harvard Book Store welcomes psychology professors KURT GRAY and DANIEL GILBERT for a discussion of Gray's book The Mind Club: Who Thinks, What Feels, and Why It Matters, co-authored with Daniel M. Wegner.About The Mind Club<\/p> <p>Nothing seems more real than the minds of other people. When you consider what your boss is thinking or whether your spouse is happy, you are admitting them into the \"mind club.\" It's easy to assume other humans can think and feel, but what about a cow, a computer, a corporation? What kinds of mind do they have? Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray are award-winning psychologists who have discovered that minds\u2014while incredibly important\u2014are a matter of perception. Their research opens a trove of new findings, with insights into human behavior that are fascinating, frightening and funny. The Mind Club explains why we love some animals and eat others, why people debate the existence of God so intensely, how good people can be so cruel, and why robots make such poor lovers.<\/p> <p>By investigating the mind perception of extraordinary targets\u2014animals, machines, comatose people, god\u2014Wegner and Gray explain what it means to have a mind, and why it matters so much.Fusing cutting-edge research and personal anecdotes, The Mind Club explores the moral dimensions of mind perception with wit and compassion, revealing the surprisingly simple basis for what compels us to love and hate, to harm and to protect.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u201cDaniel Wegner was among the world\u2019s cleverest, wittiest, and most beloved social psychologists. The Mind Club is genuinely novel, with brilliantly conceived studies on some of the deepest issues the mind of man can ponder.\u201d - Steven Pinker, author of The Stuff of Thought and How the Mind Works<\/p> <p>\u201cDaniel Wegner\u2019s final book is a masterpiece made ever more precious by his untimely death. Thankfully, his brilliance and wit live on\u2014in these pages, and in his collaborator and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Kurt Gray, who presents their ideas with clarity, depth, and style. The Mind Club is not to be missed.\u201d - Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

Most useful in this hierarchy is the Family category because if a birder can at once place an unfamiliar species into its proper family, he\/she has taken a major step toward making a correct identification.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

His scenes of an evocative northland, isolated peaks, and vast expanses of shimmering water are considered essential images of the country. This exhibition\u2014guest curated by collector, actor, writer, and musician Steve Martin and organized by the Hammer Museum (Los Angeles) and the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto)\u2014will include approximately 30 major paintings of Harris\u2019s idealized northern landscapes from the 1920s and 1930s, one of the most significant periods of the artist\u2019s career.

In Gallery 334, the MFA\u2019s traditional home for paintings from the Lane Collection, Steve Martin, a knowledgeable and avid collector of American modernism, selected works that resonate with his understanding of the work of Lawren Harris as an important modern painter of the Americas. Martin came to the MFA in September to view the American paintings collection in storage, looking at works by artists such as Arthur Dove, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Rockwell Kent, and Marsden Hartley, and discussed the various connections between American modernism and Harris\u2019s work. The final group of works on view has been shaped by Steve Martin in collaboration with the MFA and Andrew Hunter, curator of Canadian Art at the Art Gallery of\u00a0Ontario.<\/p> <p>The Robert and Jane Burke Gallery, 335, includes works on paper by Lawren Harris relating to two paintings he sent to the International Exhibition of Modern Art, held at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926, as well as works by artists like Alfred Stieglitz, Max Weber, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Joseph Stella, who were also represented in the 1926 exhibition, with different selections. This installation explores how, through an alternate lens of city, industry, and nature, artists of the United States were contemplating similar themes of spirituality and stillness that Harris sought in his paintings of the\u00a0North.<\/p> <p>Above: Arthur Garfield Dove,\u00a0Square on the Pond, 1942.

They are the young Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and longtime friend Raymond Aron, a fellow philosopher who raves to them about a new conceptual framework from Berlin called Phenomenology. <\/b>\u201cYou see,\u201d he says, \u201cif you are a phenomenologist you can talk about this cocktail and make philosophy out of it!\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>It was this simple phrase that would ignite a movement, inspiring Sartre to integrate Phenomenology into his own French, humanistic sensibility, thereby creating an entirely new philosophical approach inspired by themes of radical freedom, authentic being, and political activism. This movement would sweep through the jazz clubs and caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank before making its way across the world as Existentialism.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Featuring not only philosophers, but also playwrights, anthropologists, convicts, and revolutionaries, At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9 follows the existentialists\u2019 story, from the first rebellious spark through the Second World War, to its role in postwar liberation movements such as anticolonialism, feminism, and gay rights. Interweaving biography and philosophy, it is the epic account of passionate encounters - fights, love affairs, mentorships, rebellions, and long partnerships - and a vital investigation into what the existentialists have to offer us today, at a moment when we are once again confronting the major questions of freedom, global responsibility, and human authenticity in a fractious and technology-driven world.<\/p> <p>\"Bakewell brilliantly explains 20th-century existentialism through the extraordinary careers of the philosophers who devoted their lives and work to 'the task of responsible alertness' and 'questions of human identity, purpose, and freedom.' Through vivid characterizations and a clear distillation of dense philosophical concepts, Bakewell embeds the story of existentialism in the 'story of a whole European century,' dramatizing its central debates of authenticity, rebellion, freedom, and responsibility.\" \u00a0- Publishers Weekly\u00a0<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Quincy moved to LA from Seattle to pursue a career in stand-up four years ago. Within his seven years of stand-up experience, Quincy has toured the country and played the best stages in LA, including shows with comedy legends like Bill Burr. In 2013 Quincy Jones was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame (while our Quincy was drinking a Chai with almond milk in a Korea Town coffee shop). On July 3, 2015 Quincy was diagnosed with stage-four Mesothelioma cancer. He was given one year to live. Quincy is currently not strong enough to work his regular barista day job; his energy can only last a few hours at a time. On nights that he is feeling well he makes sure to hit the stages around Los Angeles, spreading laughter, as he preps for this stand-up special film shoot. While on stage, Quincy is cancer free.<\/p> <p>Quincy will be filming his one hour comedy special at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles on April 4, 2016. We at Limelight Comedy Club are thrilled and honored to have Quincy headline in preparation for the special.<\/p> <p>Get tickets for Quincy's show at Limelight Comedy Club on March 30th here: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1pT3buw\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1pT3buw<\/a><\/p> <p>100% of this show's proceeds will be donated directly to Quincy's Kickstarter.
