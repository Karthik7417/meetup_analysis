Typically, our Meetups begin with introductions and a few creative prompts. Then we'll spend the rest of our time writing in companionable silence, with occasional breaks. Toward the end of the Meetup, we'll invite people to share what they've written, if they wish. Our venues have everything we need: private rooms with tables and chairs, restrooms, kitchenettes, and free parking. We provide extension cords and power strips for laptops and creative-writing guides for onsite inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, we may offer writing workshops, but for now, the focus is on simply gathering to write.

They are my idols but I knew from the get-go that I am absolutely not yet one of them. I want to scream, throw a tantrum, kicking up like a baby while whining and sobbing and swearing on the floor. I don't act like this all the time though because it requires a bit physical strength.

Whether you help out full-time or just a few hours a week, caregiving is hard work and can be a strain on our emotional, psychological, financial, and physical well-being. Maybe you work at the same time, or have a family of your own to take care of, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This meet-up group is for informal caregivers of older adults on the South Shore. It is a space to socialize with others who understand your challenges, share your experiences and learn from other caregivers who are in a similar position, and hopefully have a few good laughs too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even if the loved one whom you cared for has recently passed, and you are still dealing with how all that feels you are welcome to join us. You were there, understand us and have something to bring to the group.<\/p>\n<p>Since taking on the care of my Mother 5 years ago, I personally feel somewhat isolated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My established friends do not stand my unique situation and don't understand the challenges and stress caregiving brings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join the group for coffee dates, lunches, brunches, dinners, seminars (when I can find them), guest speakers, or even movie nights and other events. Fun and relaxing things. &nbsp;It is my hope this group will become a place of solace and support for we who could use a little care too : )<\/p>\n<p>I am happy to get meetup suggestions from the group as well.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for joining us, we need you too!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>PS - if you are interested, here is a link to caregiving statistics in the US.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caregiver.org\/selected-caregiver-statistics\">https:\/\/www.caregiver.org\/selected-caregiver-statistics<\/a><\/p>","lon":-70.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/9\/highres_445952585.jpeg","photo_id":445952585,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/9\/600_445952585.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/9\/thumb_445952585.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11040373,"name":"Michelle M","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/8\/8\/highres_70934472.jpeg","photo_id":70934472,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/8\/8\/member_70934472.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/8\/8\/thumb_70934472.jpeg"}},"members":21,"name":"South Shore Adults Caring for Aging Loved Ones","id":19350209,"state":"MA","urlname":"South-Shore-Adults-Caring-for-Aging-Loved-Ones","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.0800018311,"who":"South Shore Givers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Somerville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452989306000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mystery","name":"Mystery","id":320},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"murder-mystery","name":"Murder Mystery","id":14054},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"crime-fiction","name":"Crime Fiction","id":26821},{"urlkey":"mystery-book-club","name":"Mystery Book Club","id":27401},{"urlkey":"mysteries","name":"Mysteries","id":38110},{"urlkey":"mystery-readers","name":"Mystery Readers","id":68961},{"urlkey":"mystery-adventures","name":"Mystery Adventures","id":80716},{"urlkey":"mystery-thriller-bookclub","name":"Mystery Thriller Bookclub","id":105908},{"urlkey":"murder-mysteries","name":"murder mysteries","id":149375},{"urlkey":"cozy-murder-mysteries","name":"cozy murder mysteries","id":149376},{"urlkey":"mystery-suspense-thrillers","name":"Mystery\/Suspense\/Thrillers","id":637322},{"urlkey":"mystery-books","name":"Mystery books","id":1183132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Somerville-Library-Murder-Mystery-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for people who love murder mysteries and would enjoy meeting once a month at the Somerville library on Highland Avenue to discuss the murder mystery of the month.

This Meetup is for people from all spiritual backgrounds, all faith and and belief systems, and all nationalities, who are interested in receiving help and healing on the spiritual path through Bruno Groening's teachings. <\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening (1906-1959), a simple German man, taught that \"a divine power exists and it can heal. \" He had very precise, intuitive knowledge of this healing power and&nbsp; made it freely available to everyone through his teachings, helping thousands of people receive help and healing. His teachings continue to be shared today through one of the world\u2019s largest non-profit organizations for spiritual healing, the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends.&nbsp; Healings continue to this day, even of so called incurable diseases, and are recorded and verified by medical doctors and psychologists in all major specialties who work together in the Circle of Friends' Medical Scientific Group (MWF).<br><\/p>\n<p>The Circle of Friends passes on these simple teachings free of charge through information lectures throughout the world. We invite you to attend Introductory lectures and film showings in the Boston area and experience this healing energy for yourself, in a simple and natural way. (See our Calendar for upcoming events.) There is no fee. Donations are appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening friends also meet locally every three weeks at Community Hours to take in the divine healing energy together. In the Boston area we currently have a Community that meets in Andover, and we are hoping to open another community closer to downtown Boston in the spring. Other New England Communities meet in South Hadley, MA, in Maine (Freeport and Ellsworth), and in Vermont (St. Johnsbury.) See our calendar for these&nbsp;Communities' schedules. All who wish to attend the Community Hours need to be introduced to the teachings of Bruno Groening beforehand, either at an Introductory lecture, or by phone.&nbsp; Contact the Organizer for more information.<br><\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you soon, and we invite you to contact us for more information. <br><\/p>\n<p> All warmest wishes to you on your path,<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Susan Downing <\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup Organizer and leader for New England Communities <br><\/p>\n<p>413-531-6677 <br><\/p>\n<p>susan.downing.bg@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Eric Guyer<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Leader of the Andover Community <br><\/p>\n<p>guyer.eric@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>More about the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends: The \"Bruno Groening Circle of Friends\" is a well respected international organization founded in 1979 by Grete Hausler (1922-2007) that was recently publicly awarded the \"Peace Pole\" by the United Nation's World Peace Prayer Society (WPPS), on May 23, 2013.

Our half-day workshop on taking the next step toward untying the knot will cover the legal, financial, family and personal issues that are often encountered during the divorce process. Trained professionals (Family Law Attorneys, Mediators, Divorce Financial Analysts and Child\/Family Specialists) will provide you with knowledge and information you need to know to empower you through the divorce process with confidence and peace of mind. All our presenters are volunteers and members of The Divorce Center. We do not self-promote our own practices. We are committed to providing you with unbiased information in a compassionate and understanding way. Is Litigation the only way to go? Is Mediation or the Collaborative Process right for you? What is considered a marital asset in Massachusetts? How is child support and alimony calculated? How do we tell the children about our divorce? These questions and many others will be answered during our workshops. Each attendee receives our 32-page Resource Handbook as well The Divorce Center's Directory of Divorce Professionals. Light breakfast and beverages are included in the $30 registration fee. Pre-registration is required at www.thedivorcecenter.org. Workshops are held on the second Saturday of every other month in several Metro West locations. Other workshops say they donate their proceeds to a non-profit...we are the only non-profit in Massachusetts offering these services to the public. Your fee helps to support our mission of making divorce more civil and less traumatic, by providing you with the education and support you need to make the best choices for you and your family.","lon":-71.4300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":160000192,"name":"Diane Pappas","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/highres_216404192.jpeg","photo_id":216404192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/member_216404192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/thumb_216404192.jpeg"}},"members":44,"name":"The Divorce Center - Next Step Workshop - Untying the Knot","id":19412777,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Divorce-Center-Next-Step-Workshop-Untying-the-Knot","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453480015000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256},{"urlkey":"arts-culture","name":"Arts & Culture","id":154787}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MFA-Boston-Museum-Council-Meet-Ups\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Museum Council of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is a membership group for supporters ages 21 to 45 with exciting annual programming designed to bring you closer to the collections at the MFA and the arts scene in Boston.

I recently attended a travel seminar where we observed inter-religious conflict and harmony in India. There we saw many instances where people of various religious backgrounds linked arms for the sake of social improvement: doing things like opposing gender inequality, inter-religious conflict, and caste system injustice. Nothing in India was perfect, but for a society that has been exposed to many major religions for so long, I wonder whether there is anything we can gain and apply in our context.

We now have 12 people which is the cap for our first meeting on March 8. If three or four more people want to form a \"waiting list\" that is fine with me since I'm sure something may come up for a couple of people between now (Feb. 3) and March 8.<br><\/p>\n<p>Women 60-plus support group: Is your life changing now that you're older? Do you have more time to do exciting things? Are you surprised that you are sometimes lonely? Is it weird to be less goal-oriented? <br><\/p>\n<p>This is a group for women who are in the midst of changing circumstance: your career has changed or gone away, your children are living their own lives, you have some health issues, yet you still have a million great ideas. One week you feel completely jazzed; the next week you wonder about the direction you're going in.

We at Small Planet Institute are focused on what we call \"living democracy,\" which is both a daily personal practice and a requirement of a government that answers to its people.

We're thinking movie screenings, book discussions, trainings, social gatherings. We're creating a \"there\" for community to come together in the most fundamental practice of democracy. Let's ACT! If we can bridge cultural gaps, learn and share, and be inspired by stories of success or struggle, we are practicing the \"living democracy\" that we need to see on our municipal, state and federal levels, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We're currently working on a money-out-of politics field guide, researching and writing a book, hosting events, and organizing for this April's mass action, Democracy Spring.

These include the circulatory system, the respiratory system, the endocrine system, and memory. In the bloodstream, they affect the organs as well.

Please bring your own snacks &amp;amp; drinks in a suitable container, especially for children. Families wishing to host over a meal time should state their intention to do so.

We also like to meet up with people who just want to eat, drink, dance, or socialize with music in the background. The exact nature of the jam will depend on who is participating and where it is held, but the goal is to play with minimal discussion and no preparation. Don't expect any level of skill or familiarity, so no covers. This style of play does result in some rough patches. We develop a strange appreciation of these rough spots; however, the goal is to find grooves. We don't mind riding through some mess, but we also try to hold onto those groovy riffs. We shoot for something between the chaotic, dissonant nature of free improvisation and the tedium of practiced music. At the end of the day, it is just supposed to be fun. Nobody should ever tell anyone else they are messing up. But at the same time, everyone should be trying to play in such a way that it is easy for others to work with. This might mean playing simple repetitive patterns with a limited set of tones (or keeping a steady beat on the drums). No theory is necessary, but if you are curious, look into the Circle of Fifths, pentatonic scales, and keys. We like to switch around on the instruments. It is helpful if everyone is willing to play drums for a bit (drumming the whole time can be tiresome). Anyway, hopefully that long description didn't scare you away.

Together, we can learn how to cook healthier recipes, as well as offer each other much needed guidence and support during our journey.","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6261687,"name":"Dawn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/d\/c\/highres_254249148.jpeg","photo_id":254249148,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/d\/c\/member_254249148.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/d\/c\/thumb_254249148.jpeg"}},"members":172,"name":"Get in Shape Boston-Weight Loss & Fitness Support for Women","id":19630876,"state":"MA","urlname":"Get-in-Shape-Boston-Weight-Loss-Fitness-Support-for-Women","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Diet and Exercise Enthusiests"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"West Roxbury","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456586842000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"breakup-support-group","name":"Breakup Support Group","id":37692},{"urlkey":"break-up-recovery-moving-on-after-the-break","name":"Break-up Recovery: Moving On after the Break","id":39892},{"urlkey":"getting-over-a-breakup","name":"Getting Over a Breakup","id":67418},{"urlkey":"breakup-of-a-relationship","name":"Breakup of a Relationship","id":89377}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Beginnings-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A group of men come together , who have recently been single, came out of a bad breakup or divorce , seeking support from others, good conversation , dining out and just having fun, loving ourselves<\/p>","lon":-71.1500015259,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194170596,"name":"john ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/0\/e\/highres_254273006.jpeg","photo_id":254273006,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/0\/e\/member_254273006.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/f\/0\/e\/thumb_254273006.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"New Beginnings Club","id":19632999,"state":"MA","urlname":"New-Beginnings-Club","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Open Hearts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Somerville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456591950000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"games","name":"Games","id":15992},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-England-Gaming-Convention\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>NEGC is a 1-day gaming convention held in April in Davis Square, Somerville.

Since 2012, LOCS unites LBTQ women of color and allies for a day of networking, advocacy and empowerment. LOCS features 60-75 minute workshops\/sessions focusing on various topics impacting our community. The 4th Annual LOCS will be held on Saturday, March 19, 2016. LOCS Collective\u2019s purpose is to address the gross disparities that exist regarding access to community and resources for LBTQ women of color in Boston and surrounding areas. Concurrently, there are few organizations dedicated to providing services solely to LBTQ women of color. Our vision is to create spaces\/platforms for LBTQ identified women of color in Boston and surrounding areas to celebrate our vibrant culture, solidify our community and increase our visibility. We do this by: Developing partnerships with regional and national organizations that serve and support LBTQ identified women of color and streamlining their resources into our communities. Encouraging supportive and respectful discussions within and outside our community. Empowering through activism, education and networking. ALLY PRIDE: In addition to uplifting LBTQ communities of color we also recognize the undeniable necessity to foster genuine and wholesome relationships with our allies, charging ourselves as well as other communities to actively advocate for one another. We encourage community collaboration and development.

My 20+ year's of research into what ails America has led me to publish a book \u201cCulture War Cracked\u201d to broadcast my shocking conclusion that what conservatives know of as the \"Culture War\" is in fact King George's Counter-American Revolution being waged secretly. He established his bulwarks against our Constitution at Fortress Harvard, switched his ammo from black powder to white powder (opium) and his loyalists have been waging a self-funding, perpetual war against our freedoms for hundreds of years. So, clearly I need some face-to-face time to prove myself out, as my thesis must sound like quite a stretch! But seriously, my book proves this out by connecting the dots with details of our history that\u2019ve been hidden from view. I posted the press release at SavingATB.com (short for Saving America the Beautiful). Free PDF download of my 98 page book, Culture War Cracked, at 911BloodTrail.com. Once I get enough interested, I hope to have meetings in and around Boston. I anticipate multiple meet-ups each month since this topic is huge and this election is marching forward. I can imagine holding them in places like Boston, Framingham, Peabody, Burlington, Waltham, Dedham and Quincy. This all depends of interest level though. To peek your interest in the subjects we\u2019ll discuss, I have reverse engineered the Culture War and can shatter both the Establishment Class and the New World Order with relative ease. It just took lots of Googling and plenty of inspiration.

This isn't to impugn anyone who fits these categories. I feel like these attitudes have a part to play in political discourse. However, I've been finding it harder to find nuanced discussion in both the media, and, sometimes, even, in everyday life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>This Meetup is an attempt to rectify that, find people who are similarly interested, and get together and talk. While I don't imagine this group to be directly activist, if people want to use it to meet others with similar outlooks who are interested in organizing, I think that would be great.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'll admit, I don't have an exact definition of a moderate. Thus, if the title rings true to you, please take the leap and come on down. This group is intended to be non-partisan - Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party members, are all welcome. In my opinion, and my experience, most people are moderates not because they lack passion for their beliefs, or because of any particular ideology, but because they understand many different points of view and respect the nuance and difficulty of dealing with complex issues.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you may have guessed, this is a bit of an experiment, so the shape of the group will most likely change over time. To start, I imagine we'll have a topic and perhaps some reading beforehand so that people can have a general reference point for the discussion (I'm thinking articles, not whole books). But, if people are interested, join, send me a message, and let me know what interests you so that we can figure out a way to make this work.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10881692,"name":"Kevin Schwartz","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/highres_13635351.jpeg","photo_id":13635351,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/member_13635351.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/thumb_13635351.jpeg"}},"members":63,"name":"Moderate Politics Meetup","id":19699778,"state":"MA","urlname":"Moderate-Liberal-Politics-Meetup","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Moderates"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Malden","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457902009000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"game-night","name":"Game Night","id":40126},{"urlkey":"portable-gaming","name":"Portable Gaming","id":612322}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/portable-gaming-of-greater-boston\/","rating":0,"description":"this group will meetup and play games on systems like nintendo 3ds ps vita etc","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":157247142,"name":"matt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/highres_254732932.jpeg","photo_id":254732932,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/member_254732932.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/thumb_254732932.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"portable gaming of greater boston","id":19703514,"state":"MA","urlname":"portable-gaming-of-greater-boston","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.4300003052,"who":"gamers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Watertown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457915661000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"bridal-boot-camp","name":"Bridal Boot Camp","id":16062},{"urlkey":"personal-training","name":"Personal Training","id":18628},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camp","name":"Fitness Boot Camp","id":20087},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camps-for-women","name":"Fitness Boot Camps for Women","id":20627},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness-boot-camp","name":"Outdoor Fitness Boot Camp","id":26872},{"urlkey":"body-toning-boot-camp","name":"Body Toning Boot Camp","id":35421},{"urlkey":"fat-loss-boot-camp","name":"Fat Loss Boot Camp","id":35422},{"urlkey":"all-female-kick-boxing-boot-camp","name":"All Female Kick Boxing Boot Camp","id":37989},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness-boot-camp-for-women","name":"Outdoor Fitness Boot Camp for Women","id":67328}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Watertown-Fitness-Boot-Camp\/","rating":5,"description":"Watertown Boot Camp is a place where you will be working out in a positive environment with like minded individuals who want to live happy and healthy lives!

The sport is enjoyed by walkers, hikers, runners, and families with kids. All events are timed, but it is up to each participant to decide whether to casually walk a course, or run it like it was their own personal amazing race.

I started this group to introduce more people to delicious vegan food and how to cook. We'll get together from time to time at my home in Milton to cook a delicious meal together and then eat it. Hopefully, with lots of casual conversation and plenty of opportunities to learn how to make your own delicious food without being intimidated by ingredients you've never heard of. I'll pull together a menu (suggestions welcome) and a cost per person, then buy the ingredients and the group with come over to make and eat great meal together. Everything will be vegan in a very non-threatening, no superiority or hostility environment where you take a break from being a carnivore. Or, if you're already vegetarian or vegan, learn how to cook those dishes that seem a little intimidating. Emphasis is on: good food, learning how to cook, and an enjoyable meal with people open to new things!<\/p>\n<p><b>Please note: this is not a \"healthy food\" club.<\/b> There are lots of people who see vegan food only as a holistic natural lifestyle that is filled with beautiful vegetables and great health. This club isn't for those people. &nbsp;Rather, this club is for people who enjoy eating great food and learning how to make it. &nbsp;Not nibling on celery sticks with almond butter (although that is a really tasty snack!). So, there is no way that any of the food we'll be making and eating can be classified as \"health food\". &nbsp; If you're looking for a way to shed calories from your diet, this is not the group for you. I am not a health food person, not even remotely. But I'm 100% plant fueled. &nbsp; I'm asking people to pay for being in this club and attending suppers, so I don't want there to be any confusion about the type of vegan food this club will be working with. Of course, the health benefits of a plant-based diet are numerous and significant. &nbsp; Additionally, this is not a group to figure out how to be vegan on a budget. This is a group about eating great food and learning how to cook it with some really nice people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A note about \"dues\" -- Meetup isn't free. &nbsp;In order to create a group, it costs ~$15 a month. &nbsp;Therefore, the dues are to recoup my costs in setting up the group. &nbsp;You only need to pay dues if you want to actually attend an actual Vegan Supper Club Meetup. &nbsp;You can be a member and just wait for a meetup that you'd like to attend: then pay your $5 dues at that time. &nbsp;It doesn't cost anything to be a member of the group, but it will cost $5 a year if you want to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;Hope that makes sense!<\/p>\n<p>Costs: there will be a charge to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;The charge will vary by event, and will be clearly described. &nbsp;I anticipate that it will cost $30-$45 per person for each supper: you get a great 3 course meal, learn about vegan food and how to cook it, great conversation and drinks in a fun environment.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/9\/600_447902425.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/highres_447902467.jpeg","photo_id":447902467,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/600_447902467.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/thumb_447902467.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193142247,"name":"John T","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/highres_249958762.jpeg","photo_id":249958762,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/member_249958762.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/thumb_249958762.jpeg"}},"members":69,"name":"Boston Vegan Supper Club","id":19717265,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonVeganSupperClub","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.25,"who":"Supper Club Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"South Weymouth","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458146578000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"makeup","name":"Makeup","id":1481},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"women-beauty","name":"Women & Beauty","id":23642},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"healthy-moms","name":"Healthy Moms","id":26042},{"urlkey":"mind-body-wellness","name":"Mind Body Wellness","id":26120},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"beauty","name":"Beauty","id":63675}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Social-Juniko-Healthy-Women-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"The Social @ Juniko is delighted to provide you with a welcoming, fun and beautiful sanctuary within our boutique fitness facility.

In the 1960s we coordinated a major drive to help chiropractors become legally licensed in over 40 states. In the 1970s we waged very successful campaigns against fluoridation. In the 1980s we pushed through legislative recognition of acupuncture. In the 1990s we lobbied to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act S-784, fought malathion spraying, promoted public education on the dangers of vaccinations, and continued fighting the fluoridation battle. In the 2000s we are working to prevent the Codex attempts to restrict your freedom to take vitamins and minerals and we are currently taking action to defeat the Senator Durbin Bill (S.722) that seeks to restrict DSHEA with his move to require dietary supplement manufacturers to submit Adverse Event Reports, to institute a pre-approval process with the FDA for all dietary supplements that are stimulants, and to re-classify anabolic-steroid dietary supplements as Controlled Substances. The other NHF battles include opposing S.1780, S.1538, H.R. 207 and H.R. 3377 (considered the Son of Durbin bill). We are also supporting health-promoting legislation such as the Access To Medical Treatment Act and a repeal of the Kefauver Amendment of 1962 that gave the FDA expanded authority over drug \u201cefficacy\u201d and thus the ability to play favorites with drug companies. We are fighting alongside other countries against a major health freedom threat, one whose goal is to harmonize vitamin and supplement laws that strictly regulate natural health foods worldwide.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4641316,"name":"Mauricio"},"members":18,"name":"The National Health Federation\/Boston, MA.","id":19740552,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-National-Health-Federation-Boston-MA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Health Freedom Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458602785000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"healing-arts","name":"Healing Arts","id":18823},{"urlkey":"leadership-development","name":"Leadership Development","id":19539},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"business-mastermind","name":"Business Mastermind","id":66029},{"urlkey":"holistic-business-networking","name":"Holistic Business Networking","id":97487},{"urlkey":"holistic-entrepreneurship","name":"Holistic Entrepreneurship","id":99253}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Holistic-Business-Mixers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Holistic Authority Leadership Society's (Boston, MA) social networking group for holistic businesses and heart-driven entrepreneurs.

Just kidding, or maybe not? But isn't it always the same 10 people showing up with their eager handshakes, eating the same greasy appetizers, and drinking the same bottle of chardonnay? If that's your cup of tea, then knock yourself out.<\/p> \n<p>Personally, I want something different.<\/p> \n<p>Being a new mom has opened my eyes to many things. Some are too gross to share here, but one of the main things that I've come to value is . . . TIME.<\/p> \n<p>Holy crap . . . how humbling (and nerve-racking) is the reality of TIME? It's an unstoppable, non-negotiable force that keeps slipping through our fingers. The tighter you grasp at it the more it slips out of your hand.<\/p> \n<p>I am done wasting TIME at random business meetings, listening to the same stories, surrounding myself with empty smiles. I'd rather play toy trains with my toddler for 10 hours than spend 10 minutes at yet another basic business meeting.<\/p> \n<p><b>\"Stop complaining, Jessica, and doing something about it!\"<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Yep, that's right. Instead of being the type of naysayer that sits in the stands, pointing my finger and critiquing the archaic networking efforts of others . . . I'm going to design my own type of networking event.<\/p> \n<p><b>Say hello to Spark! Networkers \u2014 Speed Networking with a TWIST.<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Here's a quick rundown . . .<\/p> \n<p>\u2022 Gather together at a new location once a month (for now). &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Delicious eats and treats. Cash bar. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Again\u2014no business cards, no name tags, no professional labels. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Structure the event similar to speed networking. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 The meeting is organized, timed, and efficient. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Each (registered) participant will be assigned a number. &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p><b>But what's the TWIST?<\/b><\/p> \n<p>That part will be kept \"hush hush\" until you attend your first event.

NO ONE is going to do business with you unless they trust (and like) you, as a person.<\/p> \n<p>Nowadays, people see right through the pretty fonts and modern color schemes. You might make an awesome first impression with people, but if you're a total jerk, good luck getting new clients (and friends).<\/p> \n<p>There are pros and cons with business groups and chambers today. For me, the cons outweigh the pros. Of the hundreds of people I've met over the years, there were only a handful with whom I truly felt connected. Everyone else became just another superficial connection on LinkedIn or simply forgotten. Sad, but true.<\/p> \n<p><b>Spark! Networkers<\/b> is my reaction. It's my experiment. It's my mission.<\/p> \n<p>Strip away the professional labels. Eliminate the fakeness. Remove boring conversation that barely scratches the surface. Instead, bring passionate business owners together. Ignite an immediate connection. Cultivate healthy and sustainable relationships. Share our real personality, our desires, our fears . . . our humanity.<\/p> \n<p>Is all this possible in just one night of networking? Who's knows? But we're going to find out, regardless. I invite you to join me, and all the other \"outside of the box\" thinkers.<\/p> \n<p>No membership fees. My events are <b>FREE<\/b> (for the time being) with registration required.<\/p> \n<p>Come with an open mind, and leave with a full heart.<\/p> \n<p>Warmly, &lt;br&gt;Jessica Brand<\/p> \n<p>p.s.<\/p> \n<p>This is not a space for recruiting new contacts or adding people to your email list. Since we're not exchanging business cards, you won't be able to receive anyone's email or phone number without their permission.<\/p> \n<p>Spark! Networkers is not a club for singles looking to mingle. Basically, if you make more than one person feel uncomfortable, I'll have to respectfully block you from the group.<\/p> \n<p>If you reserve a seat at our events and not show up (without prior notice), I'll be bummed. If you do it again, I'll happily remove you from the group.
