Winding along the immediate outskirts of the Olympic Village that anchored the 2014 Winter Olympics, the 5.848 km track is a medium-speed circuit with a variety of different corners, including a left-hander inspired by the famous long triple apex Turn 8 at Istanbul Park. The track features 12 right and six left-hand corners, with a 650-meter straight between the first and second turns, on which the cars reach a top speed of around 200 mph.<\/p> <p><b>STANDINGS -<\/b>\u00a0After a dominant win at Suzuka, Nico Rosberg now leads in the Drivers' Championship by 36 points.

The system uses <b>mist<\/b> to water and oxygenate the roots of whichever vegetables you plant in the vertical columns, such as the popular <b>Tower Gardens<\/b>. It uses only 10% of the water and nutrients that would otherwise be necessary in traditional ground-level gardening, because everything is recycled. Tests have shown that aeroponic gardening creates <b>30% more produce<\/b>, as seen in vegetables that grow both larger and faster, with a higher density of nutrients.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/3\/e\/600_448384670.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Gardeners have much less work to do with aeroponics. Because the plant roots are inserted into openings in vertical columns, there's no digging, tilling, weeding, or even bending over, which is especially beneficial for seniors. With <b>no soil<\/b> in the columns, soil-born pests are no longer a problem. Typically, 28 plants can be grown in a space just 2.5 feet in diameter.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/7\/0\/600_448384720.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This class will be taught by garden group member <b>Laura Lee Winslow<\/b>. We'll meet in her home to view an informative PowerPoint presentation, and in her garden where we'll examine her Tower Gardens, as shown in these photos. We'll see how these <b>columns are portable<\/b>, and can be placed wherever they can receive 5 to 6 hours of daylight. They're ideal for those who have very small gardens, or just a deck, patio, lanai or balcony. They can even be positioned <b>indoors<\/b> by a sunny window, or surrounded by grow lights.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/9\/7\/600_448384759.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>As in most of our group's classes, generous members bring along some light foods and drinks for others to share during the traditional <b>snack-and-chat<\/b> period. Others bring their excess plants for the <b>free plant-exchange table<\/b>, and take home other plants for their own gardens. Such features help long-time members meet the many newcomers, and encourage everyone to exchange gardening ideas for this semi-tropical environment.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/b\/5\/600_448384789.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>To learn more about aeroponic gardening with Tower Gardens, click on this green link to see <b><a href=\"http:\/\/lauralee.towergarden.com\/\">Laura Lee's web page<\/a><\/b>.

I started this group last year, and I want to keep it going, as sharing meditation with others is my passion. We'll meet Saturdays and Sundays at 10am under the big shady tree at the Great Hill in Central park (the entrance is Central Park west and 103rd street). Take the path leading into central park, and go left (up the slope) until you get to the clearing at the top of the hill. If it's rainy or bad weather, I won't be there, but if the suns out, you can find me under the hill. I will let the group know ahead of time if I have to cancel in advance. The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together. Look forward to seeing all of you!<\/p> <p>This meditation is free.

It was part of the wider disaster, the Soviet famine of 1932\u201333, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country.<\/p> <p>During the Holodomor, which is also known as the \"Terror-Famine in Ukraine\" and \"Famine-Genocide in Ukraine\", millions of citizens of the Ukrainian SSR, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by the independent Ukraine and 14 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet Union.<\/p> <p>Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials varied greatly; anywhere from 1.8 to 12 million ethnic Ukrainians were said to have perished as a result of the famine. Recent research has since narrowed the estimates to between 2.4 and 7.5 million. The exact number of deaths is hard to determine, due to a lack of records, but the number increases significantly when the deaths inside heavily Ukrainian-populated Kuban are included. Older estimates are still often cited in political commentary. According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kyiv in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficit.<\/p> <p>Scholars disagree on the relative importance of natural factors and bad economic policies as causes of the famine but believe it was a long-term plan of Joseph Stalin, an attempt to eliminate the Ukrainian independence movement. Using Holodomor in reference to the famine emphasizes its man-made aspects, arguing that actions such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs, and restriction of population movement confer intent, defining the famine as genocide; the loss of life has been compared to the Holocaust. If Soviet policies and actions were conclusively documented as intending to eradicate the rise of Ukrainian nationalism, they would fall under the legal definition of genocide.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/0\/2\/600_449134306.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front, and I'll have a sign on the table.

Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by the independent Ukraine and 14 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet Union.<\/p> <p>Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials varied greatly; anywhere from 1.8 to 12 million ethnic Ukrainians were said to have perished as a result of the famine. Recent research has since narrowed the estimates to between 2.4 and 7.5 million. The exact number of deaths is hard to determine, due to a lack of records, but the number increases significantly when the deaths inside heavily Ukrainian-populated Kuban are included. Older estimates are still often cited in political commentary. According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kyiv in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficit.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/f\/9\/600_449134297.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This event is co-sponsored with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fans-of-Capitalism\/events\/230453471\/\"><b>Fans of Capitalism<\/b><\/a>.\u00a0 Please only RSVP on one meetup, otherwise counting heads is difficult.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in the front, and I'll have a sign on the table.

Earth energies are at their strongest and most active. All of life is bursting with potent fertility and at this point in the Wheel of the Year, the potential becomes conception. On May Eve the sexuality of life and the earth is at its peak. Abundant fertility, on all levels, is the central theme. The Maiden goddess has reached her fullness. She is the manifestation of growth and renewal, Flora, the Goddess of Spring, the May Queen, the May Bride. The Young Oak King, as Jack-In-The-Green, as the Green Man, falls in love with her and wins her hand. The union is consummated and the May Queen becomes pregnant. Together the May Queen and the May King are symbols of the Sacred Marriage (or Heiros Gamos), the union of Earth and Sky, and this union has merrily been re-enacted by humans throughout the centuries.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p><br\/>Meet other members for a brief happy hour mingle while guests arrive.\u00a0 Once everyone has checked-in you'll be seated for your series of four minute \"mini-dates.\" On your dating card that you receive at check-in, you'll select who you wish to see again. You can choose Dating or Friendship as your preferred connection.<\/p> <p>We will collect everyone's dating cards at the end of the event and email you your mutual matches within 48 hours.<\/p> <p>While this event is geared towards helping people meet potential romantic matches, you can also mingle with all the guests and find new friends as well.<\/p> <p><br\/>On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.<\/p> <p><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people.

The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final.

This combination reflects our deep respect for the environment and our gratitude toward the dedicated people who produce our food. Angelica Kitchen is pure vegan - 100% plant based - and a minimum of 95% of all food used to prepare our menu has been grown organically. Maintaining committed, direct relationships with local farmers, food artisans, purveyors, and customers keeps our menu reasonably priced while ensuring the vitality of the ingredients. Ingredients used to prepare our menu are grown ecologically and fairly traded; we use renewable sources of energy and a high quality backwash carbon system to filter our water; our active composting assures as little waste as possible.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/8\/f\/600_448654959.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/9\/7\/600_448654967.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/9\/f\/600_448654975.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/a\/5\/600_448654981.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/b\/e\/600_448655006.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>New York Magazine<\/b> raves: \"With its chic SoCal decor and warm bohemian ambience, Angelica Kitchen deserves its reputation as one of downtown's best date spots for vegetarians.

The famous walnut-lentil p\u00e2t\u00e9 is as flavorful and richly textured as any meat variety; and desserts, despite the absence of eggs and refined sugars, are necessary indulgences here (definitely order them topped with maple-tofu whipped cream).

The suddenly,\u00a0they\u00a0were tasked with ferrying one of these mysterious items and the courier carrying it to somewhere it would be safe.<\/p> <p><br\/>They learned quickly that numerous were those with interest in what they\u00a0possessed. Their mission was immediately fraught with danger and the party was running for its life. Then, just as quickly as it had started, it was over. The adventurers became separated from many in their group including Melrick, the wizard that had hired them to protect his journey.<\/p> <p><br\/>They passed\u00a0through\u00a0an alien realm they\u00a0soon\u00a0became certain was the dark realm known as the Shadowfell. Their stay on the plane of shadow was short-lived, however, and\u00a0they soon found themselves back in the natural world. But they were very far from home and a number of their comrades were not with them.<\/p> <p><br\/>What will Robin, Meline, Trask, Poe, Zyle, and Malako do now? Do they try to reunite with their mates and finish their mission? If so, how will they go about finding them? These are questions they all ponder and one of their number does so along with the realization that they\u2019ve arrived at his homeland. A homeland he had\u00a0left nearly two decades prior swearing to only return when he had made his fortune.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Pursuit of Power\" is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the first and third Thursdays of each month. We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Monday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game. This game will run in parallel with the\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cKeeper of the Keys\u201d game with my hope being both groups can meet for a massive gaming session every now and again.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/229795620\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"In Pursuit of Power - An Azocar Adventure","id":"dfvsrlyvhbdb","time":1462228200000,"updated":1462240711000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":19.0593948364,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452189385000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby...\u00a01 Peter 2<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Please bring your life's questions to our monthly bible study with the fantastically, spiritually-endowed Sean Isaacs- who will answer your questions through the bible and his godly wisdom on life.

Followed by Jeroen Soeters, senior developer for ThoughtWorks, who will present building artificial neural networks using neuroevolution.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Schedule<\/b><\/p> <p>6:30 PM - 6:45 PM Settling in and introductions<\/p> <p>6:45 PM - 7:15 PM Optimizing restaurant reservations by Reina<\/p> <p>7:15 PM - 8:30 PM Neuroevolution presentation by Jeroen<\/p> <p>8:30 PM - 9:00 PM Networking<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Summary 1<\/b><\/p> <p>It is important for a restaurant whether to accept or reject a reservation request to improve their revenue. An experienced manager knows which party they should accept and which not. \u00a0These days, online restaurant reservations are increasing. So, we need some algorithm to judge a request instead of a restaurant manager. My approach is to develop an algorithm which can determine the most efficient table configuration and acceptance of parties. The model is a mixture of Monte Carlo methods and combinatorial optimization. I will talk about how to formulate the problem and how to solve it. The simulated results show the best table configuration accepts 50% more customers than the worst one.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Summary 2<\/b><\/p> <p>Neuroevolution is a subcategory of machine learning that applies evolutionary computation to generate artificial neural networks. Traditionally neural networks are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Back propagation is limited in its application especially in scenarios where a training set of sufficient size is unavailable as in artificial life or evolutionary robotics. Backpropagation also puts a lot of constraints on the topology of the network. The number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons per layer need to be known in advance, the activation function must be differentiable, the network must be fully connected and recurrent connections are not allowed. Neuroevolution provides an alternative approach which generates nets that don't suffer from these limitations and can evolve to any topology.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I take you on a journey where we first explore the foundation of artificial neural networks and evolutionary computation. In the latter half you will learn how to combine the two and create a general-purpose platform for neural network based systems from cleaning robots to financial oracles.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Biography 1<\/b><\/p> <p>Reina Kikuchi is a data scientist for Recruit Lifestyle, the company that has 40+ services, like restaurant search and reservation service, hotel search service and salon search service in Japan.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled. Because of this, the facilitators and\u00a0participants of this group will be expected to keep member identities,\u00a0meeting locations, and content confidential to protect everyone\u00a0involved.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality and safety of our group members, please email [masked] with the following questionnaire for the location details.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Member Questionnaire:<\/b><br\/>In an effort to ensure all members of this group are respectful and\u00a0open to others, we ask that you fill out this short questionnaire so\u00a0the organizers can tailor the group to its members.

Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Want to learn one language that you can use to build web apps and iPhone apps, do system administration, and security? Why not start with Ruby? This course is a great place to start if you want to learn basic programming concepts and a new language.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ruby is the programming language underpinning the Ruby On Rails framework\u2014which powers applications and products like Hulu, Groupon, Airbnb, Square, Kickstarter, Github, Shopify and more. There is a thriving, friendly community of users, and the job market for developers is strong. Learning Ruby is the foundation to opening doors to these opportunities, and this class will prepare you for future classes dedicated to the Rails framework.<\/p> <p>This class is great for beginners - <b>no previous coding experience required.<\/b> We will guide you through the basics of programming and learn Ruby along the way. The course will help you think like a programmer, give you some readily-applicable skills, and answer any questions you may have. We'll use the Interactive RuBy shell; write command line programs that use loops, conditionals, methods, and classes; and learn the basics of object oriented programming. We'll mix lecture and practice, and help guide you through the coursework.<\/p> <p>CLASS DATES This 4-session Intro to Ruby course runs on Monday and Wednesday for two consecutive weeks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Monday, May 2nd from 7-9pm<br\/>\u2022 Wednesday, May 4th from 7-9pm<br\/>\u2022 Monday, May 9th from 7-9pm<br\/>\u2022 Wednesday, May 11th from 7-9pm<\/p> <p>SLACK CHANNEL: GDI NYC now has a Slack channel!

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan.\u00a0\u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014<\/p> <p><br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014 \u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

There is such a big network of Jewish professionals in Teaneck, and all that is missing is one place to actually get together at a single time. Mocha Bleu is one of Teaneck's finest restaurants and a perfect place to socialize and network over a danish and cup of coffee on a Tuesday morning. The number one reason people's businesses fail is simply the lack of business, and the only way to remedy that is by networking. The value of monthly networking is immeasurable to anyone who needs to spread the word about themselves or their businesses. However, it is a joint effort and we need people to commit to coming in order for this to happen. The first meeting is the week after Pesach, and there is plenty of time to spread the word to family and friends. As long as we get enough people this can be extremely successful, but it must be a joint effort.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/230527100\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvhbfb","time":1462312800000,"updated":1462324661000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10954","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nanuet","address_1":"148 New York 59","name":"Growler & Gill Craft Beer Shoppe","lon":-74.005318,"id":12155462,"state":"NY","lat":41.094646,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":28,"distance":23.8746814728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1404759557000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Best \u00a0Early Start Open Mic Around!

And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If you purchase tickets online and can\u2019t make it to the theater, just respond to the email address you receive the confirmation email from (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>) and they can refund the payment remotely.<\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Fri\/Sat) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket unless you buy a gift card at the theater and pre-load it 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to drive there in advance if you want seats near us. OR you can just show up that night and sit wherever there is space available.<\/p> <p>Hope to see YOU at the movies!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love, Cassie<\/p> <p>PS: I am doing this with my friendship group too so if you are S&amp;L do wear your wristbands. These are loads of fun at the movies they glow in the dark!<\/p> <p><b><i>if you can't make it, no need to post why.

Many people still think that they must use an RDBMS for applications even though records in their datasets have no relation to one another. Additionally, RDBMS databases are typically optimized for transactional use, and data must be exported for analytics purposes. NoSQL technologies have turned that model on its side to deliver groundbreaking performance improvements.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, we will walk through a music database with over 100 tables in the schema and show how to convert that model over for use with a NoSQL database.<\/p> <p>You will learn how to handle creating, updating and deleting records, using column families for different types of data (and why).<\/p> <p>You will also learn how to leverage Apache Drill's ANSI-SQL capabilities on the NoSQL database to use the exact same data without moving or transforming it to perform analytics.<\/p> <p><b>Jim Scott, Director of Enterprise Strategy &amp; Architecture, MapR<\/b><\/p> <p>James A.

After mastering the craft you will be able to write faster and more effectively. Don\u2019t be surprised if your first drafts start looking like third drafts and writing becomes more fun and free.

The result of perpetual scarcity, they contend, is a life fixated on agonizing trade-offs, crises, and preoccupations that impose persistent cognitive deficits. Using these findings, they suggest remedies for everything from hospital overcrowding to financial ignorance.

However, if you're responsible for ruining someone else's game by spilling a beverage or food on it, the right thing to do is to offer to purchase a new copy for them. Some of the games we bring are out of print so please treat every board game with respect.<\/p> <p>- If a game is accidentally ruined by a staff member, everyone at the table should pitch in to buy a new one for the owner. More often than not, this comes to about $10\/person or less, so in our opinion it isn't too much to ask for.<\/p> <p>Thanks everyone &amp; see you on Tuesday night!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/431969846974239\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers\/events\/230468951\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Weekly Game Night at TGIF","id":"xpqtmlyvhbfb","time":1462316400000,"updated":1462332291000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355802481000,"name":"Forest Hills Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":6280132,"urlname":"Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Board Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11377","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Woodside","address_1":"52nd St and 39th Dr.","name":"Windmuller Park Track","lon":-73.912138,"id":1212759,"state":"NY","lat":40.747285,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.08798360825,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461777432000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We'll meet just inside the park entrance at 52nd St. and 39th Dr. at 7:00 p.m. for our 3.4-mile loop around Woodside, Sunnyside, and parts of LIC.

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

But at 5\u201910\u2019\u2019 and 180 pounds, she\u2019s theatrically challenged. Her family life is a tangle of mystery and deadly secrets, and nobody is telling Cinnamon the whole truth. Before her older brother died, he gave Cinnamon The Chronicles of the Great Wanderer, a tale of a Dahomean warrior woman and an alien from another dimension who perform in Paris and at the 1893 Chicago World\u2019s Fair. The Chronicles may be magic or alien science, but the story is definitely connected to Cinnamon\u2019s family secrets.

To further accommodate students of all levels, we offer 4 different classes: beginners, advanced-beginners, intermediate and performance.<\/p> <p>Sometimes referred to as Mambo, the New York style Salsa On2 dominates the Mambo and Salsa competitions, although those styles are gaining respect as well.

The first hour consists of shines and the second hour focuses on dynamic turn patterns for all levels (beginner, intermediate or advanced). The classes teach leading\/following techniques, improved partners\u2019 connection, styling tips for men and women, Salsa timing and spinning. The classes also develop your own individual style on the dance floor.<\/p> <p>The Salsa On2 is mid-to-up-tempo salsa, with an emphasis on percussion and band orchestration rather than on vocals. It differs slightly from traditional salsa, known as Salsa On1, mainly by its timing which emphasizes the conga drums beat and encourages the dancer to listen to percussive elements of the music. It tends to place a greater emphasis on performing \u201cshines\u201d, where dancers separate and dance solo for a time.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.soldancecenter.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sol-Dance-Center-Salsa-Social\/events\/230600595\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Advanced Beginner Salsa Class","id":"hnsnrlyvhbfb","time":1462320000000,"updated":1462329427000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1458078907000,"name":"Sol Dance Center Dance Studio","group_lon":-73.9100036621,"id":19714408,"urlname":"Sol-Dance-Center-Salsa-Social","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Salseros"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":21.9513301849,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454182271000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>O'Connors has a great Trivia game going every Tuesday.

Open data is a growing global resource with potential to grow business, improve quality of government service, and increase innovation in healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, gender equality. The Africa Open Data Community is a convening space for tech industry, small businesses, journalists, civic tech, entrepreneurs, researchers, students, IT solution providers, banks, telcoms, insurance companies, NGO's, donor organizations, and local and national governments to connect virtually and in person to share advances in open data, share lessons, and form new collaborations. \u00a0We seek a transparent, open dialogue and concrete action on common challenges and shared solutions for communities and partners across Africa.<\/p> <p><br\/>Open data can generate jobs, build business confidence, make government more transparent, and revitalize communities.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Open data from satellites can inventory agricultural production, help farmers improve yields, and improve financial results.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Open data about transportation networks can improve freight delivery, tourism, and public safety. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Open health data can help consumers understand the capacities, costs, and potential outcomes of healthcare in their communities.<\/p> <p>\u2022 And open climate data can help nations prepare for climate change and improve social and economic adaptation.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Journalists can use open data to reveal new patterns of social, economic, and scientific discovery to tell new stories and help communities understand their world.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Private Industry can publish open data and engage with civic leaders to empower women and transform conditions that are good for business and society.<\/p> <p><br\/>Data is a tool to achieve the goals that matter to people, business, and government. \u00a0Working with this tool requires new skills and old common sense. AODC events provide both and engage people, civil society, journalists, and the private sector in a public dialog about the power of open data to transform our communities, governments, and businesses. \u00a0All of us can lead, partner, and work together to collect, publish, and share open data resources to drive sustainable development.<\/p> <p><br\/>Africa must diversify its economies, increase economic participation, and empower women \u00a0- and data is an untapped resource that can generate tremendous economic opportunity. It can open up trade, improve agricultural production, reduce hunger and poverty, make service delivery more efficient, empower women, and help us all prepare for climate change.<\/p> <p>AODC: Open Sustainable Development Data Day<\/p> <p>At the edges of the regional gathering of Open Government Partnership, AODC will host a day event to share government and organizational experiences in developing and institutionalizing open data policies, will tackle a few of the Sustainable Development Goals including water and agriculture to determine how open data can be most useful in achieving the targets, and highlight the untapped leadership role of the private sector in sourcing and using quality open data for Africa. \u00a0This event is for journalists, civic technologists, IT solution providers, banks, telecommunications companies, insurance companies, NGO's, and local and national governments to roll up their sleeves and collaborate in workshops and interactive discussions.<\/p> <p><br\/>In 2015, more than 190 world leaders committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to help us all end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change. We each have a role to play if we\u2019re going to achieve these goals of a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world. \u00a0In this event, we are focusing on the role of open data in advancing two of the global Sustainable Development Goals:<\/p> <p><br\/>SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls<\/p> <p>Gender inequalities are still deeply rooted in every society. Many women lack access to employment opportunities, basic education, and health care, and are often subjected to violence and discrimination. The math is simple: in countries where there's higher gender equality, there's less poverty, more economic growth, and a higher standard of living. Investing in women-run businesses produces the greatest return for growth and stability in other sectors within local communities and banking institutions are repaid loans in full at an average 97% far higher than the mean. \u00a0Let's improve opportunities for everyone by dismantling barriers to women's participation in economic, social and political life.<\/p> <p><br\/>SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts<\/p> <p>The world's industrialised nations have changed the balance of the earth's carbon cycle over the last 150 years by burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Climate change has the potential to derail other efforts toward sustainable development by altering weather patterns that threaten our food production and increasing sea levels which will displace coastal communities.

Previously they described basic market analytical and trading practices developed by legendary chartist and trader Richard D. Wyckoff, and illustrated in a detailed case study how these techniques can be applied using bar charts. On May 4th, they will discuss the critical role that Point and Figure (P&amp;F) charts also play in the Wyckoff Method with respect to trade selection, timing and management. During this presentation, Bruce and Roman will demonstrate how to:<\/p> <p>Construct a Wyckoff-style P&amp;F chart;<br\/>Apply Wyckoff P&amp;F count guidelines to estimate price targets and reward\/risk ratios of potential trades;<br\/>Analyze phases on P&amp;F charts to predict short- and longer-term price objectives;<br\/>Time entries to coincide with a stock's readiness to move out of a trading range;<br\/>Use \"stepping stone\" consolidations to confirm price targets and identify when a prior trend will resume; and<br\/>Combine P&amp;F and bar chart analysis to refine trade entries and exits.<\/p> <p>These applications of P&amp;F charts are unique to the Wyckoff Method, and provide an exceptionally informative complement to bar chart analysis. Traders of all levels of skill and experience will benefit from and enjoy this presentation.

If you have RSVP-ed and do not show up by the time we kick off and teams are full, you will be put aside. \u00a0for those who show up late, I will set some cones aside so you can play a smaller game against anyone else who shows up late.\u00a0If you don't show up at all and RSVP-ed \"yes\", you will be warned 3 times and after that every time I see your name on RSVP you will be put as a \"no\". I know this is an issue for some of you but please understand in all fairness we don't want a game of 14 v 14, the field does not have enough space.<\/p> <p>Also since this has come back up, we do not tolerate ground playing, overly physical play, and bad sportsmen-ship. You will be warned \u00a0twice and on the third, ejected. We are in this game for the fun and love of the sport.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0If you have any gripes about this please message me and we can talk but in all likely-hood I will not make an exception.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Springfield-Co-Ed-Drop-in-Soccer\/events\/229627070\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"Soccer meetup","id":"bsrfrlyvhbgb","time":1462397400000,"updated":1462405601000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1370098230000,"name":"Springfield Co-Ed Pickup Soccer","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":8735132,"urlname":"Springfield-Co-Ed-Drop-in-Soccer","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Footballers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"11 Times Square (42nd St @ 8th Avenue)","name":"Microsoft","lon":-73.98555,"id":18309292,"state":"NY","lat":40.757809,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.588667094707,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457918343000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>ALL ATTENDEES MUST REGISTER ON EVENTBRITE IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THIS EVENT: \u00a0<\/b><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/playcrafting-nyc-spring-expo-tickets-23020174963\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/playcrafting-nyc-spring-expo-tickets-23020174963\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/playcrafting-nyc-spring-expo-tickets-23020174963<\/a><\/a><\/b><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/9\/0\/600_447824432.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>100 games. 700 players. 1 night.

Achieving Net Zero, however, is a tremendous challenge in a urban environment where density, shadows, and restricted roof area often limit PV, where a focus on first cost and short payback horizons limit the appetite to invest in a Low Carbon future, and where an aversion to risk can cause building owners and developers to get gun-shy or cause a contractor to triple their bid.<\/p> <p>So how do we rise to the challenge?\u00a0 Hear leading practitioners discuss their unique perspectives on the design, construction and financing of ultra high performance buildings. Team leads of highly touted projects such as Cornell Tech and PS 62 will discuss lessons learned, obstacles overcome, and their recommendations for how more architects, engineers, contractors, and developers will be able to make the impossible possible in the years to come.<\/p> <p><b>Moderator:\u00a0<\/b>Max Driscoll, AIA, LEED AP BD+C; \u00a0Director Sustainable Development, SPN [business ecology]<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Panelists:<\/b>\u00a0Deborah Moelis, AIA, Senior Associate, Handel Architects;\u00a0Adrian Tuluca, Senior Principal, Vidaris;\u00a0John Lee, Deputy Director, Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency, NYC Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability; Robert DaRos, Vice President Sciame Construction<br\/>---<\/p> <p><b>About the Sponsors:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Sustainability Practice Network<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0(SPN) is a New York based inter-disciplinary community of professionals who seek to learn and share knowledge to advance sustainable development across sectors and disciplines.
