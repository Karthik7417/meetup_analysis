Holding a degree in social work and organizing in his community for decades, Badee has a wealth of wisdom he will share with us through both film and word.<\/p> <p>Badee's current work is with Human Rights Defenders; a grassroots media justice organization who use their own video equipment to document Israeli raids, attacks, and human rights abuses by soldiers and settlers so they can release these reports online for a global audience.

Badee\u2019s time incarcerated taught him the necessity of studying anti-colonialism and teaching youth, both Palestinian and Israeli, about it\u2019s inner-workings. \u201cAfter my release from jail, I began to think differently about the real enemy for me and my people. I heard about Israelis struggling against the occupation. That encouraged me to try to connect with Jewish people who had solidarity with our issue.

He is politically vacuous. What he does have are hyperbolic slogans, insults, obscenities and a speaking style not above a fifth grade level. But worse, he is a demagogue who appeals to the frustrations of his base and incites anger, even violence. But worse still, he wins the favor of the crowd through the demonization of others \u2013 Muslims, Latinos, the disabled, women. Whatever programs he espouses are, for the most part, impossible, and he repeatedly contradicts himself, while making a virtue of his unpredictability. The more he is attacked, the more he rises in the polls. His campaign is outside the bounds of reason. He appeals to the gut, not to the mind.<\/p> <p>That a person such as Donald Trump should emerge as a major contender for the most powerful office in the world, is surreal, a Dadaist nightmare. Whatever else, his success so far, should he ultimately win or lose the presidency, is itself a dire statement on the nature of our democracy.

Our wide ranging curriculum allows kids to examine themselves, their community and the world in general. We teach about different cultures, philosophies and religions. We encourage our students to ask questions, think for themselves and make up their own minds about the bigger questions in life. Our children develop strong values and ethical standpoints. The Sunday School Graduation Rite of Passage, completed by our 8th graders, allows them to present to the community how their Sunday School experience has informed their moral and ethical development.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EthicalFocus\/events\/229510347\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Joe Chuman: Thinking About Fascism","id":"qcmtklyvgbfb","time":1459695600000,"updated":1459708314000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202088040000,"name":"The Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":991158,"urlname":"EthicalFocus","group_lat":40.8899993896,"who":"humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Perth Amboy","address_1":"224 High St","name":"Congregation Beth Mordecai","lon":-74.266579,"id":20896612,"lat":40.505253,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.3237304688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458597799000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join YJPA and The Oneg Group of Central NJ for a kosher boozy brunch!<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll have waffles (and bloody marys) and fruit (and mimosas) and quiche (and screwdrivers) and all the other yummy foods (and drinks) that make up the \"not quite breakfast, not quite lunch\" universe!<\/p> <p>We'll have...<br\/>-Waffle bar<br\/>-Purim-themed cocktails<br\/>-Assembling care packages for the needy<br\/>-Wine tasting<br\/>-Good friends and good times!<\/p> <p>The event is FREE, but donations are welcome to help support our programming!<\/p> <p><br\/>Please RSVP so we know how much to make!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Congregation Beth Mordecai, 224 High Street, Perth Amboy NJ","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/YJPA-Young-Jewish-Perth-Amboy\/events\/229772171\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":9000000,"name":"YJPA and Oneg Group present: kosher boozy brunch!","id":"229772171","time":1459697400000,"updated":1459708407000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443627997000,"name":"YJPA: Young, Jewish Perth Amboy","group_lon":-74.2799987793,"id":18982771,"urlname":"YJPA-Young-Jewish-Perth-Amboy","group_lat":40.5200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454302849000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Suggested Donation","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>IMPROV FOR ACTORS - Expect the Unexpected<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/2\/e\/600_372274862.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Surprises are opportunities.<\/b> When you are open to whatever comes your way you are able to be fully present and let go of the need to control the outcome.

Huntington and his second wife, Arrabella Yarrington, who was the teen aged daughter of the proprietor of a boarding house where Collis stayed while developing railroads in Virginia. Arrabella used her husbands wealth to accumulate a large art collection, which is now housed at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, and encouraged her son Archer to pursue intellectual and artistic activities.<\/p> <p>The National Academy is an honorary association of American artists which operates a school and museum and is housed in the opulent townhouse that was Archer and Anna's home and Anna's sculpture studio.

Archer established the Hispanic Society in 1904 as part of his lifelong interest in the history and culture of Spain.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/229937597\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"cvdgrlyvgbfb","time":1459699200000,"updated":1459711842000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"207 5th Ave","name":"Body Reserve Gym","lon":-73.980309,"id":24274751,"state":"NY","lat":40.676109,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.1411113739,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452886207000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Are you looking for a complementary training to <b>ENHANCE<\/b> your overall well being on and off the track, to be more <b>FLEXIBLE <\/b>and <b>RELEASE<\/b> physical, mental and emotional tensions?<\/p> <p><br\/>Are you looking for <b>RELIEF<\/b> from joint wear, tightness, pain, and\/or discomfort?<\/p> <p>$5 FOR FIRST CLASS TO CROSS TRAIN...<\/p> <p>_________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b><i>About <\/i><i>Yin Yang Yoga...<\/i><\/b><b><i>A typical Yoga class is \u2018Yang\u2019 in style and focuses on active heating and muscular contraction - by starting with \u2018Yin\u2019, a more passive, nourishing, and cooling practice, this uniquely designed class WILL enhance your alignment, performance, and overall sense of balance!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why For Runners\/Athletes?<\/b> - Lengthening and releasing effect from repetitive movements on sheets of connective tissue can overtime shorten and tighten it in ingrained patterns around the muscles.

She spent her teens\u00a0hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and dumpster\u00a0diving. By twenty-two, she had resigned herself to\u00a0employment, but was still broke, directionless, and\u00a0working a mediocre day job she\u2019d taken for the\u00a0health insurance.<\/p> <p><br\/>It was there that Sophia decided to start selling\u00a0vintage clothes on eBay. Eight years later, she is the\u00a0founder, CEO, and creative director of Nasty Gal,\u00a0a $100 million plus online fashion retailer with\u00a0more than 350 employees. Sophia\u2019s never been a\u00a0typical CEO, or a typical anything, and she\u2019s written\u00a0#GIRLBOSS for outsiders (and insiders) seeking\u00a0a unique path to success, even when that path is\u00a0winding as all hell and lined with naysayers.<\/p> <p>#GIRLBOSS includes Sophia\u2019s story, yet is\u00a0infinitely bigger than Sophia. It\u2019s deeply personal\u00a0yet universal. Filled with brazen wake-up calls\u00a0(\u201cYou are not a special snowflake\u201d), cunning and\u00a0frank observations (\u201cFailure is your invention\u201d),\u00a0and behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty Gal\u2019s\u00a0meteoric rise, #GIRLBOSS covers a lot of ground.\u00a0It proves that being successful isn\u2019t about how popular\u00a0you were in high school or where you went to\u00a0college (if you went to college). Rather, success is\u00a0about trusting your instincts and following your gut,\u00a0knowing which rules to follow and which to break.<\/p> <p>A #GIRLBOSS takes her life seriously without taking herself too seriously. She takes chances and takes responsibility on her own terms. . She knows when to throw punches and when to roll with them. When to button up and when to let her freak flag fly.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As Sophia writes, \u201cI have three pieces of advice I want you to remember: Don\u2019t ever grow up. Don\u2019t become a bore. Don\u2019t let The Man get to you. OK?

Are some ancient myths actually Star Maps revealing the secret location of Atlantis? Is America the New Atlantis? Are we currently undergoing an Atlantean Cycle? Are we the Atlanteans reincarnated? Are Atlantean intelligence from other planes or planets secretly controlling or guiding us? These and many other questions will be addressed. Bio: Hercules Invictus has been exploring the fringes of our reality throughout his entire life and has been sharing his experiences publicly for over four decades. He founded, among other things, the Regional Folklore Society of Northeastern PA and the Center for the Study of Living Myth in NJ.

I don't like the pressure\/seriousness\/aggression of competitive sports. Solo forms of exercise just seem so dreadfully boring and repetitive to me. And I don't like being told what to do\/having to follow specific instructions for long periods of time, which rules out most group exercise stuff I've been exposed to. So, I've decided to do these little event-experiments to see if there might be alternative forms of group exercise for me and people like me who aren't totally satisfied with the exercise options out there right now (or who maybe just want to try something new). The goal is to create a space for people who want to exercise NON-COMPETITIVELY in a GROUP SETTING with an emphasis on SPONTANEOUS CREATIVITY and SELF-DIRECTED SELF-EXPRESSION.<\/p> <p>To be crystal clear: disparaging\/judgmental attitudes of any kind will not be tolerated at this event. The idea is to create a safe space for people to have fun, get exercise, and be themselves. In terms of what events will look like, we will basically be doing an (interactive) warm-up, some stretching, and then going straight into the dance party! There are no rules for the party, only guidelines. One guideline is to try to root whatever movements you are doing in some sort of heart rate raising action, such as running in place, jumping, etc.... Another guideline is that if at any moment you are really feeling the music\/your movements, you may shout \"CHANNEL!\" and anyone who wants to will look at you and then, if they want, mimic\/channel your movements in some way.<\/p> <p>**NOTE: People who are not sure if they feel comfortable moving creatively\/dancing in front of others are more than welcome to just run in place\/\/do jumping jacks\/\/anything else! There are no rules saying you have to dance\/move creatively the whole time, or even any of the time, if you don't want to!**<\/p> <p>**ANOTHER NOTE: People are being invited to this event in many different ways so the number of RSVPs the event has here is basically meaningless. We had 10 people come last time, so it will probably be in that ballpark.**<\/p> <p>THAT IS ALL FOR NOW FOLKS TO BE CLEAR THIS EVENT IS OPEN TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO IS INTERESTED AND IS BEING HELD IN THE SPIRIT OF PROMOTING MENTAL\/PHYSICAL WELLNESS FOR ALL HUMANS! PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND ALSO LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!

Have you ever wondered about your life before this birth? Whether your beliefs embrace the reality of past lives or not - you can bring your open mind and curiosity for exploring life's secrets. Keep it simple and enjoy the discussion with like minded people. Cheryl has been doing past life regression in the form of guided imagery for over ten years now. She's been researching the topic for her own healing for 30 years now. Her approach is simple and effective. There will be time afterwards for a cup of tea and some Q &amp; A. NOTE: There is a fee of $25 for this event. In Cheryl's words: \"Past Life Regression is a Shamanic deep trance state of consciousness in which you receive images and\/or sensory input, which give information about your past lives.This information can enter the mind stream in small bits or in a straightforward stream of consciousness storyline. Past Life Regression is a way of obtaining insights from such sources as your higher self, inner wisdom and the wisdom of the universe. Often, such insights are extremely valuable and healing in regard to your present life situation, providing highly relevant background information to help you move forward on your current life's journey\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Montclair_Shamanic_Circle\/events\/229515324\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Past Life Regression","id":"229515324","time":1459717200000,"updated":1459771204000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1314900121000,"name":"Montclair Shamanic Circle","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":2424042,"urlname":"Montclair_Shamanic_Circle","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Shamanic Practioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"150 W 46","name":"The Sacred Light Fellowship","lon":-73.984283,"id":17614742,"state":"NY","lat":40.757992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.629292488098,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1385764747000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\"Psychic &amp; Spiritual Development and The Path of Inner Transformation\"<\/b><br\/>The class meets every Sunday of each month from 5:30pm to 7:30pm.<\/p> <p>This class will be an in-depth study of psychic reading, healing and developing further your clairvoyant abilities.

If you have a swimming background and are interested in learning water polo, please read the pdf below thoroughly and contact Alex Barclay.

The first and third Sundays are geared towards scrimmaging and the second and fourth are more focused on skills and\/or conditioning. Bob or\u00a0Jeff\u00a0are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk in.

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life. If you can find a way to slow down and live more mindfully, you are well on the way to being an agent of joy and serenity in your own life and the lives of those living around you.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"A or 1 Trains to 190th Street, south entrance to the church.

I know firsthand the difficulties in letting go of a toxic relationship. For me, my mind was saying one thing - to let go - but my heart was saying something else. Even though I knew in my mind the\u00a0relationship I was in was toxic, my heart just could not break\u00a0the ties and I was determined to do whatever it took to hold on. Thankfully, with the support and encouragement of like-minded community, like this group, I was able to let go and move onto healthier relationships. Today, I no longer need an intimate relationship to make me feel whole. I became\u00a0a certified addiction recovery coach and created this group to share all that I have learned and to create a space for us to connect. \u00a0In this group, we will support one another in\u00a0making healthier choices, which attract healthier relationships,\u00a0and be in community with people, just like you &amp; me, who are looking to heal from toxic relationships and take back our lives.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"side door facing Kohl's","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rockland-Social-Group\/events\/228194103\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Heal From Toxic Relationships","id":"dhqjvcyvgbfb","time":1459725300000,"updated":1459737886000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1276326506000,"name":"The Rockland Social Calendar","group_lon":-74.1100006104,"id":1659920,"urlname":"The-Rockland-Social-Group","group_lat":41.1300010681,"who":"Event Organizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chatham","address_1":"368 Main St","name":"Postpartum Place","lon":-74.387444,"id":21941922,"state":"NJ","lat":40.742218,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.8541469574,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1397329730000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Due to the Easter holiday, Sun March 27th group is rescheduled for Sun., April 3rd.<\/p> <p>Let's keep the conversation going....even though we always welcome babies most moms leave their baby home with dad\/partner\/caregiver for this evening meeting.<\/p> <p>Moderator: Julie Thompson MSW mother of two and moderator of our Mothers' Club<\/p> <p>FYI- We use meetup as just another way of advertising this group so more mothers attend than just what are listed here.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"across from Valley National Bank, blue house  next to Gulf station","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Julies-Mindful-Parenting\/events\/228477028\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Julie's Mindful Parenting\/Working Mothers Group","id":"qppkhjyvfbkc","time":1459726200000,"updated":1459737890000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297784964000,"name":"Julie's Mindful Parenting","group_lon":-74.4000015259,"id":1784084,"urlname":"Julies-Mindful-Parenting","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Moms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"334 Amsterdam Avenue","name":"The JCC in Manhattan","lon":-73.979973,"id":4391662,"state":"NY","lat":40.781071,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.21446824074,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456359778000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>New Swing Dance Session With Spencer @ The JCC in Manhattan<\/p> <p>334 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY @76th street<\/p> <p>\u00a0with\u00a0 Spencer Weisbond<\/p> <p>Six week, progressive session <\/b>: Mar 13, 2016-Apr 17, 2016<br\/>Sun<br\/>7:30PM - 8:30PM &amp; 8:30PM - 9:30PM<br\/># of Sessions: 6<br\/>Except:\u00a0 <b>Feb 7th No class!<\/b><br\/>\u00a0 <b> 102: Advanced Beginner -\u00a0 7:30 -8:30pm<\/b> Advance in Jitterbug and East Coast Swing by learning more involved patterns with harder footwork.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States displaced 682,900 jobs following NAFTA alone, which puts even more pressure and competition on U.S. workers trying to find employment. Free trade agreements also tend to discourage unionization and increase competition with international workers, which in turn, makes wages lower and worsens working conditions globally. These problematic trends will have the most negative impact on low-income workers, whose jobs are vulnerable and whose wages are low. Women make up two-thirds of these jobs. Trade Agreement is a Feminist Issue \u2013 This makes the Trans-Pacific Partnership a feminist issue. When wages are lowered, this disproportionately affects women who are still subjected to gender-based pay discrimination and persistent patterns of low pay in occupations dominated by women \u2013 especially women of color \u2014 such as retail, food service and day care\/nursing home and home health care attendants. Additionally, similar consequences in job markets and wages in the 12 TPP countries will negatively impact women and low-income workers in those nations. (see, <a href=\"http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/fact-sheet-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/fact-sheet-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/fact-sheet-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/<\/a><\/a> )\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0The Trans-Pacific Partnership will put moderate and low-income women at risk, further cheating them out of the better wages, benefits and the job security that they deserve. On these grounds, the National Organization for Women opposes \u201cFast Track\u201d and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, and strongly urges memb ers of Congress to vote against \u201cFast Track\u201d and to oppose the TPP. Globally, the TPP could severely restrict women\u2019s rights and resources that have been infringed upon through past trade agreements, including essential medicines. Drug companies have been allowed to add stipulations to the TPP that will increase the strength (length) of patents and other related protections. With t hese protections, drug companies will be able to further monopolize the pharmaceutical market, and will inevitably raise the price of drugs in all twelve countries affected by the TPP, even though their production costs will stay the same. Also, if a small number of drug companies monopolize the market, there will be less pressure for innovation research that produces more effective drugs. Another controversial and deeply troubling aspect of the TPP is its inclusion of Brunei, a country that just last year passed horrific anti-LGBTQIA and anti-women legislation. Under these new laws, a penal code calls for the stoning of people who engage in same-sex relationships, the jailing of people who have aborti ons, and fines or imprisonment for women who give birth out of wedlock. A trade agreement that supports a country with such barbarically restrictive laws cannot call itself \u201cfree.\u201d Under provisions believed to be in the TPP, the United States would have less power to influence which nation is allowed to remain a TPP partner.\" Excerpted from NOW's \"Free Trade and Feminism \u2013 How the TPP Will Hurt Women\" by Marandah Field-Elliot <a href=\"http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/issue-advisory-free-trade-and-feminism-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/issue-advisory-free-trade-and-feminism-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/now.org\/resource\/issue-advisory-free-trade-and-feminism-how-the-tpp-will-hurt-women\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>ABOUT TERRY O'NEILL<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/>Terry O\u2019Neill, a feminist attorney, professor and activist for social justice, was elected president of NOW in June 2009.

Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/229779871\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":3600000,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflyvgbfb","time":1459728000000,"updated":1459953135000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

The suddenly,\u00a0they\u00a0were tasked with ferrying one of these mysterious items and the courier carrying it to somewhere it would be safe.<\/p> <p><br\/>They learned quickly that numerous were those with interest in what they\u00a0possessed. Their mission was immediately fraught with danger and the party was running for its life. Then, just as quickly as it had started, it was over. The adventurers became separated from many in their group including Melrick, the wizard that had hired them to protect his journey.<\/p> <p><br\/>They passed\u00a0through\u00a0an alien realm they\u00a0soon\u00a0became certain was the dark realm known as the Shadowfell. Their stay on the plane of shadow was short-lived, however, and\u00a0they soon found themselves back in the natural world. But they were very far from home and a number of their comrades were not with them.<\/p> <p><br\/>What will Robin, Meline, Trask, Poe, Zyle, and Malako do now? Do they try to reunite with their mates and finish their mission? If so, how will they go about finding them? These are questions they all ponder and one of their number does so along with the realization that they\u2019ve arrived at his homeland. A homeland he had\u00a0left nearly two decades prior swearing to only return when he had made his fortune.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\u201cIn Pursuit of Power\" is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the first and third Thursdays of each month.

Based on Chopra's teachings and meditation techniques, we will introduce one main thought or intention for the evening, and will suggest mindful ways to incorporate that centering thought into our daily everyday life. Then we will sit in meditation for about 20 minutes.<br\/>I will give a very simple introduction to the practice of meditation and very easy to follow instructions that will guide you into an effortless practice. So if you are new, you will fit right in with the group, and if you are an experienced meditator come, learn something new or refresh something you have not experienced for a while and enjoy the energy of the group as it takes you into deeper levels of stillness. Meditation as we will practice it, will train you into more focus and clarity so that you have more choices in your life. It will lead you to be less reactive and more active into what happens in your world. It will provide the \"spaciousness\" from which you can make better, healthier, happier choices. Meditation is a basic tool to a happier more creative life and when it is paired with the intention to mindfully install new habits and behaviors patterns in how you think and act, your life becomes a much more pleasurable one. Happiness or joy becomes the overriding force of your life no matter what. Come and try it!<br\/>A $10 contribution is encouraged but not required.

He\u2019s a curmudgeon\u2014the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse.

So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove\u2019s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled. Because of this, the facilitators and\u00a0participants of this group will be expected to keep member identities,\u00a0meeting locations, and content confidential to protect everyone\u00a0involved.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality and safety of our group members, please email [masked] with the following questionnaire for the location details.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Member Questionnaire:<\/b><br\/>In an effort to ensure all members of this group are respectful and\u00a0open to others, we ask that you fill out this short questionnaire so\u00a0the organizers can tailor the group to its members.

We do this in an\u00a0effort to protect our members and ensure that our group is a safe\u00a0space for all attendees.<\/p> <p>This is NOT an application, all serious members will be invited regardless of answers to the questions below.<\/p> <p>1.

In 2005, Kohler explored the iconic shipwreck looking for clues to explain the tragic sinking. The search for answers led Kohler to dive on Titanic's sister Britannic, which in a strange twist of fate, also sank surrounded in mystery. Kohler has spent the last decade unraveling the final Mystery of the Last Olympian.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p>Richie Kohler\u2019s passion for maritime history has led him to explore some of the most challenging shipwrecks in the world, but it would be the identification of a mystery WWII German U-Boat detailed in the best-selling book Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson that catapulted his diving career into the world of television and documentary filmmaking. Kohler co-hosted the long running History Channel series, Deep Sea Detectives, and worked on film projects for Paramount Pictures, CBS, PBS, National Geographic the Discovery Channel and Universal Studios. In 2005, he headed an expedition to the world's most famous shipwreck, RMS Titanic, and most recently Kohler joined legendary underwater explorer Dr. Bob Ballard aboard his research ship, EV Nautilus, documenting deep water shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico. This work was featured in the National Geographic\/NOVA documentary film, Nazi Attack on America.<\/p> <p>Kohler led his first expedition to HMHS Britannic for the History Channel in 2006 and returned again in 2009 on the National Geographic team. In the summer of 2015, Kohler returned to the HMHS Britannic leading an Explorers Club flag expedition and working with the Russian Geographical Society, successfully solved one of the mysteries surrounding the great ship's loss.<\/p> <p>Richie will be signing copies of his new book, Mystery of the Last Olympian, after his presentation.

Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school.

At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired.

You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

It's simple, can be done almost anywhere, and it's fun. I like thinking of creative, positive, and sometimes witty things to say with chalk.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/f\/5\/600_447946325.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>That said, creativity and artistic skills are not a requirement!

Some activists from Farm Sanctuary and The Humane League completed a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veganoutreach.org\/LeafletingStudy.pdf\">survey<\/a> at two college campuses where Vegan Outreach leaflets had been distributed over the years, and the results revealed that of the 403 students that had received a leaflet during their academic careers, 7 became vegetarian, 50% changed their diet in some way, and about 20% gave their leaflet to a friend who then also changed his\/her diet!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/0\/1\/600_447946337.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>While leafleting may seem daunting at first, it is actually very fun and rewarding. The following are some tips to keep in mind:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Go to an area with heavy foot traffic<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 You can say things such as, \"Information on helping animals\/the environment\", \"Help animals\", \"Learn about where your food comes from\", \"Would you like\/did you get one of these?\", etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Smile! Sometimes just smiling and saying hello is enough for people to want to take a leaflet<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Extend your arm all the way out to the person<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Hand leaflet so that it\u2019s easy to reach<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Make eye contact<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If you are nervous, feign confidence. Nervousness passes very quickly.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0If nobody is taking, try a brief pause. People mimic the actions they see others taking.<\/p> <p>While you will encounter people who are dismissive, you will also encounter people who are interested and will have the opportunity to engage in positive conversations. Focus on the good that is going to come out of the experience and don't let folks who seem uninterested deter you.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/f\/f\/600_447946335.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We'll supply the chalk and leaflets, so you don't need to bring anything.<\/p> <p>Because we want a good couple of hours before dusk, our official start time is 5:30pm. I realize that might be early for many folks, so it's OK to come whenever you can. I'll post a phone number to the meetup on the day of the event, so you can text me to find us wherever we are.<\/p> <p>We'll chalk until it gets dark, which is around 7:30. Then we can optionally grab a vegan bite at a nearby establishment and discuss how awesome our chalk messages were.<\/p> <p>If you are not sure you are ready to leaflet and\/or chalk, please feel free to still join us and just hang out and learn. Maybe you'll be ready the next time!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0While we welcome all veg types, this event is about promoting veganism, so please remember to advocate for veganism when chalking and\/or speaking to others, even if you are not vegan.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let's get out there and be voices for animals!<\/p> <p><b>How to find us:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Washington Square Park north side near the Arch at 5:30pm.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NYU Kimmel Center at 60 Washington Square S (btwn Thompson St and LaGuardia Pl) at 6:45pm.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/b\/1\/600_448208881.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-JC-Vegan-Activist-Meetup\/events\/229877646\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Vegan Chalk Challenge and Leafleting","id":"qbhwrlyvgbhb","time":1459891800000,"updated":1459903644000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1456357033000,"name":"Hoboken & JC Vegan Activist Meetup","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":19621296,"urlname":"Hoboken-JC-Vegan-Activist-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"EARTHlings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"16 Washington Place","name":"NYU Leslie eLab, Production Lab","lon":-73.995155,"id":24448394,"state":"NY","lat":40.729527,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.44304978848,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458919632000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>RSVP on Facebook and spread the word!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1583131095336760\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1583131095336760\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1583131095336760\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>With so many industries and companies now seeing the value in design, there are more options available to designers now more than ever.

He was on acid at the time, which did not prove to be a sound decision. When his mind stopped rippling, he swore off meat and illegal drugs for good.<\/b><\/p> <p>\"This helps explain why the menu at Wassail, which he opened early this spring <b>with his wife, Jennifer Lim<\/b>, is <b>fully devoted to vegetables<\/b>. <b>(Ms. Lim converted after marriage and is now fully devoted to vegetables herself.)<\/b> [David's Note: It is Ms. Lim, pictured above with her husband Ben Sandler, who has been calling and inviting our meetup group.]<\/p> <p>\"<b>Apples<\/b> roll through Joseph Buenconsejo\u2019s savory courses and Rebecca Eichenbaum\u2019s desserts as well. Luckily, this is not always obvious. Little about their cooking is. What I noticed about a <b>parsnip-apple soup<\/b> wasn\u2019t the thematic tie-in but <b>the way caramelized onions and pecans broadened the sweet, creamy flavor of the soup<\/b>.<\/p> <p>\"<b>Grilled butternut squash<\/b> was buried under <b>smithereens of nuts and seeds, a kind of exploded granola that added a wonderfully sweet and crunchy dimension to the soft squash.<\/b><\/p> <p>\"I almost always order <b>creamy little potatoes<\/b>, their red and white skins blistered and blackened over charcoal. Mr. Buenconsejo sends them off in an Eastern European direction with a dill sauce and a lather of tangy goat butter, a treatment that\u2019s both delicate and direct.<\/p> <p>\"To a <b>salad of cucumber spears and pearls of dripping-ripe melon<\/b>, Mr. Buenconsejo adds so many elements \u2014 <b>macadamia milk, chopped macadamias, sorrel leaves, borage oil \u2014 that it almost spins out of control, but it doesn\u2019t.\"<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/600_448140166.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/600_448140169.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/600_448140171.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>New York Observer - 5 Star Review (out of 5 Stars)<\/b>: \"As for what comes out of the kitchen into the warmly lit space with marble counters and filament light, <b>Mr. Buenconsejo\u2019s menu is hearty. It is also hearthy, which is both hearty and healthy and homey\u2014and vegetarian.<\/b> I\u2019ve eaten extremely well as a vegetarian restaurant critic but didn\u2019t realize how stifling having to choose was until presented with a menu like this where no choice is necessary.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/3\/600_448140179.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/600_448140188.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/600_448140206.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Bon Appetit Magazine:<\/b> \"It\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the excitement of America\u2019s growing cider resurgence. Unlike beer, wine, spirits or even cocktails, hard cider is a fresh new beverage frontier for many Americans to become familiar with and grow to love. And now, in addition to plenty of new producers hitting the maps, we\u2019ve got a new wave of cider bars to help push the movement forward as well.<\/p> <p>\"The food program looks similarly delightful, with Joseph Buenconsejo (Hotel Americano, The Lion, Aqua) at the helm and Rebecca Eichenbaum rocking the pastries. Lim says the food is loosely inspired by different cider making regions around the world, but comes together with the slant of New American gastropub with a bit \u201cmore finesse.\u201d <b>There isn\u2019t any meat on the menu, but complex presentations of vegetable dishes that pair well with cider will abound.<\/b> \u201cWe wanted to showcase the pairing qualities of cider, and since the spectrum is so wide, that leaves us a huge palette to work with,\u201d Sandler says.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/600_448140211.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/600_448140220.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Wassail is all vegetarian but not 100% vegan.

They provide a powerful paradigm that solves issues typically associated with distributed applications such as availability, data consistency, or communication complexity, and allows the creation of sophisticated and extensible data processing pipelines.<\/p> <p>Building on the ease of development and deployment provided by Spring Boot and the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, the Spring Cloud Stream project provides a simple and powerful framework for creating event-driven microservices. They make it easy to develop data-processing Spring Boot applications that build upon the capabilities of Spring Integration. At a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Apache YARN, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, or Apache Mesos.<\/p> <p>You\u2019ll see live deployment demos on different platforms ranging from local cluster to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the developer experience.<\/p> <p><b>About the Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p>Marius Bogoevici is a software engineer at Pivotal, leading Spring Cloud Stream, and working on Spring Cloud Data Flow, Spring XD, and other Spring projects. <b>Agenda<\/b><\/p> <p>6:30 pm Registration and Pizza<\/p> <p>7-8 pm Presentation<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-SUG\/events\/229940005\/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"name":"Stream Processing in the Cloud with Data Microservices","id":"229940005","time":1459895400000,"updated":1459914739000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444166291000,"name":"New York City Spring User Group","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":19002686,"urlname":"NYC-SUG","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Spring Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"237 Madison Avenue","name":"Reserve Lounge at Morgans Hotel","lon":-73.981216,"id":24419091,"state":"NY","lat":40.749832,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":200,"headcount":0,"distance":0.460848808289,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457623318000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.morganshotelgroup.com\/originals\/originals-morgans-new-york\/eat-drink\">Reserve Lounge<\/a> at Morgans Hotel\u00a0for an evening of networking and drinks with many of the best professionals New York has to offer!<\/p> <p><b>Atmosphere:\u00a0<br\/><\/b> - The dress code is Business Casual.<br\/>- We will provide name tags for everyone that attends.

A key challenge for storage systems, including both databases and NoSQL stores, is how to minimize network traffic when accessing and updating stored data. Standard data access APIs place the burden of implementing data structures on the client and thereby exacerbate data motion between clients and servers.<\/p> <p>In contrast, implementing data structures within a storage system can dramatically streamline communication since only incremental changes to stored data need to be transferred. However, building server-based data structures creates several challenges, including how to make this mechanism easy to use, secure, and extensible.<\/p> <p>In-memory data grids (IMDGs) have been widely used as distributed, key-value stores for serialized objects, providing blazingly fast data access, location transparency, scalability, and integrated high availability.<\/p> <p>Redis has pioneered the use of memory-based, data-structure stores with its support for built-in data structures, such as hashed sets and lists, to provide functionality similar to stored procedures in databases.<\/p> <p>This talk describes exciting new techniques which use the power of IMDGs to generalize this concept and enable the straightforward creation of extensible, user-defined data structures held within an IMDG. This session will explore how IMDGs can implement user-defined data structures by leveraging their NoSQL, object-oriented, data-parallel data model.<\/p> <p>We will also discuss techniques that lets applications define object-oriented methods which execute within the IMDG to implement a user-defined data structure. Other techniques extends this approach for scalability by distributing stored data across the IMDG's cluster of servers and performing data-parallel operations across the distributed data structure. Several examples will be described that demonstrate both the power of this approach and its ability to reduce network congestion.<\/p> <p><b>Dr. William L.

We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation.

devastatingly effective and versatile combative program that can easily stand alone, or augment your existing practice.\u00a0 The overarching focus is on responding to a threat spontaneously with natural, instinctive movement which strengthens and restores the body, clarifies the mind, and provides a framework for healthy, safe, life-long activity\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the

This event will focus on the topic of decentralization in the context of Bitcoin. <b>If you can't make it to the main event please join us at <a href=\"http:\/\/livebaitnyc.com\/\">Live Bait<\/a> around 9:15PM for a social hour<\/b>.<br\/>As the block size debate rages on, a common question that arises is: what function does decentralization serve in Bitcoin's security model? Said differently: how much decentralization does Bitcoin need to be secure?<\/p> <p>To answer this question we must first explore the metrics which define decentralization. Once a general framework for decentralization has been outlined\/agreed upon, we can explore varying opinions on threat models for the Bitcoin network. For example: some believe that if Bitcoin nodes were exclusively run in data centers that would provide sufficient security\/privacy\/autonomy for network participants, while others believe that resource requirements for running a full node should be kept accessible so network participants can run their own nodes and validate incoming block and transaction data without having to trust a third party.<\/p> <p>Related questions we will discuss:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Is node count a good metric of decentralization?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How accessible should running a node be?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why is running a node important (or not)?<\/p> <p>\u2022 Do you think block size should be purely a denial-of-service prevention measure?

As a healthcare provider, Eileen has witnessed her patients struggle with a host of side effects associated with their treatment protocols which \u201cgreatly reduce their quality of life\u201d. Her hospital nursing career runs the gamut, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell and\/or bone marrow transplant rescue, palliative chemotherapy regimens, comfort care, research as well as over-night House Supervisor of a 68-bed acute care hospital. Combining her personal and professional life experiences Eileen has found the unstoppable calling to advocate for medical cannabis. She understands the need to live a happy and full life. Advocating for patients, seeing the whole person, not just an illness or a disease that needs to be treated, is what a nurse does best. Eileen believes in the healing powers that cannabis can provide to those in need.<\/p> <p>You can read more about Eileen here:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/americancannabisnursesassociation.org\/Eileen-Konieczny\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/americancannabisnursesassociation.org\/Eileen-Konieczny<\/a><\/p> <p>Michael Zaytsev<br\/>Mike is the organizer of HighNY, which hosts monthly education and networking events designed to empower leaders who want to create a more healthy, compassionate world in which Cannabis prohibition does not exist.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

In 2014, Mozilla, EFF and a few other organizations came together to create \"Lets Encrypt\" - a free, automated and open certificate authority with a mission to secure the Web. In this lightning talk, we will see how easy it is to secure a Drupal site in 30 seconds.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/msound\">Mani Soundararajan<\/a> started his programming career when Y2K was still a thing, and has worked on a variety of technologies - Client\/Server, Web and a brief stint as an embedded firmware developer. He's been working on Drupal and Web technologies since 2007. He is passionate about Cloud Native architecture and DevOps practices. He is also a proud, card carrying member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).<\/p> <p>==========<\/p> <p><b>Don\u2019t Build \u201cDeath Star\u201d Security<\/b> by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/david-strauss\">David Strauss<\/a><\/p> <p>One obscure flaw caused the downfall of the Death Star, and an equally small vulnerability could be the undoing of your projects, too. Rather than scour infrastructure for every flaw and hope to be impenetrable, we should use defense-in-depth so a single vulnerability isn't devastating. In this talk, we'll cover effective ways to design resilient web infrastructure for Drupal and other Internet-facing systems.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><br\/>If you\u2019ve ever deployed an enterprise website, chances are you\u2019ve benefited from one of the tools David has developed. After co-founding Four Kitchens, a successful web development shop, David found himself gravitating away from custom client work and toward infrastructure solutions. Large clients like Creative Commons, Internet Archive, The Economist, and Wikimedia had already benefited from his scalability and database optimization work. Now he wanted to use this expertise to improve websites for everyone. When the opportunity to build an all-in-one website platform came along, he knew he needed to be a part of it. In addition to his role as Pantheon CTO, David also co-maintains the systemd\/udev layer that runs on most of the world\u2019s Linux systems, serves on the Advisory Board for the Drupal Association, and contributes to the infrastructure and security teams at Drupal.org.<\/p> <p>==========<\/p> <p><b>Making User File Uploads Safe(r)<\/b> by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/pwolanin\">Peter Wolanin<\/a><\/p> <p>It may seem \"normal\" to allow visitors or site users to upload files to your Drupal site, but there are a lot of associated security risks that you may not be aware of. This talk will detail some of those risks and also discuss relatively straightforward ways to mitigate those risks by configuring your Drupal site so that public files are not served from the same domain used to serve Drupal.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/pwolanin\">Peter Wolanin<\/a> is Principal Cloud Security Engineer Acquia and had a previous life as a Senior Scientist before making the leap into working with Drupal where he\u2019s been a contributor to Drupal core since 2005 and a member of the Drupal security team since 2008.

Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick!
