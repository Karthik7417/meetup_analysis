If you have the same problem, let's meet up and swap food! We will meet bi-weekly and each member who RSVP's will make a dish that is equivalent to 5 cups of baby food (40 oz), package it in 10 small baggies, and swap with other members. Moms will be assigned a category for their dish before each meet-up: vegetable, carb, or protein. All food must be prepared using organic ingredients. Meet-ups will be at various times and can include bringing along the babies--weekday afternoons, morning coffee, weekend brunch, happy hour. All meet-ups will be in the BoCoCa area. There must be at least 5 RSVP'd moms for the meet-up to happen.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events. We will always post on the Meetup when this is the case.<\/p>\n<p>Questions?

To fulfill this aim we have created a peaceful city sanctuary located in the heart of Chelsea. Based on the books of the modern day Buddhist teacher, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, we present Buddha\u2019s teachings in an accessible manner that can easily be integrated into our modern lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Established over twenty years ago, hundreds of New Yorkers currently participate in our programs at the main center and throughout the city. The Center is run by volunteers who themselves are dedicated practitioners, and we have a warm and welcoming community. Please feel free to drop in for a visit. During opening hours there is always someone at hand who can answer your questions. In addition to the beautiful meditation room, you can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/bookstore-giftshop\/\">bookstore and gift shop<\/a>, or just spend time in our comfortable sitting and reading area. (Reference materials are available.)<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to participate in the activities at the center, we recommend that you begin with one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/study-programs\/general-program-classes\/\">General Program classes<\/a>. The evening classes on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mondays-intro-class\/\">Mondays<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/thursday-meditation-class-2\/\">Thursdays<\/a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/sunday-morning-meditation-class\/\">Sunday morning<\/a>&nbsp;classes are suitable for newcomers.

Taught by qualified Western teachers, the meditation classes and Buddhist philosophy are very easy to understand and apply to our daily lives. The classes are suitable for both beginners and more advanced practitioners, and emphasize how to meditate and practice in our NY urban environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>More information can be found on our website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/d\/4\/600_439887092.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/highres_439837262.jpeg","photo_id":439837262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/600_439837262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/thumb_439837262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189398249,"name":"Diane Hill","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/highres_248057652.jpeg","photo_id":248057652,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/member_248057652.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/thumb_248057652.jpeg"}},"members":79,"name":"Kadampa Meditation Center NYC Meetup","id":18715176,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kadampa-Meditation-Center-NYC-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Students"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435875676000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaycouples","name":"Gay Couples","id":4605},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"friends-supporters-of-lgbt-glbt","name":"Friends & Supporters of LGBT\/GLBT","id":27521},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804},{"urlkey":"lgbt-singles","name":"lgbt singles","id":66447}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Staten-Island-LGBTQ-Pride-Bowling-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In partnership with the Pride Center of Staten Island, join your community for an of bowling and learn more about the Pride Center of Staten Island Fall Bowling League!

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

This is a creative space that values cooperation and collaboration over competition; the perfect place for people with big hearts, little egos, and open minds.

Mental well-being is the core building block of everything we do in life, whether we want to perform or not.

This is the perfect meet-up for people looking for a practical way to experience greater peace of mind, more clarity, and less stress in their day-to-day lives. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning something new that has the potential to make a lasting impact on your mental health, devoid of tips, tricks, or techniques...this is for you! If there an area of your life that you feel stuck in\u2026some area that feels stressful or even hopeless? Some situation from your past or even a present circumstance holding you back? This is also perfect for you. Most people do not realize that their lives can be significantly happier than they currently are. They think that life is hard and that struggling is normal. With a simple shift in understanding, your life will be better; it can be much better. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Note: My intention is to create a safe, non-judgmental space.

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

It's a mindset.&nbsp; It's the lost art of finding and creating opportunity. Instead of waiting for opportunities to float to the surface, break divers DIVE IN to the cold, icy, and treacherous shark-infested waters of resistance and find their 'chance of a lifetime' in the muddy bottom where no one else dares to tread. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT THIS MEETUP GROUP IS ABOUT: <br><\/b>The purpose of this Meetup group is to inspire members to pursue their dreams and find solutions to problems encountered along the way.&nbsp; Think of it as a gym membership for your life, offering engaging and inspiring meetups, seminars, and courses.&nbsp; This Meetup might also be considered life and business coaching in a fun group environment.&nbsp; Bottom line, studies have shown that we become the type of person we hang out with the most.&nbsp; So, come network, learn from, and be inspired by other winners just like you!&nbsp; . <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>If you have big dreams, great ambitions, and outlandish plans... JOIN US. <br>If you want help and encouragement figuring out how to get from Point A to Point B... JOIN US. <br>If you want to do fun things with other people with the same positive mindset as you... JOIN US. <br>If you think you are good at solving problems and offering solutions to others on this path called life... JOIN US. <br>If you want to be inspired and motivated to be more, do more, and live more... JOIN US. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>Life is tough.&nbsp; It's even harder when you're trying to accomplish big goals.&nbsp; And well, it's nearly impossible to accomplish those big goals entirely by yourself.&nbsp; So... why not share your goals and dreams with other winners and get their feedback?&nbsp; Why not encourage others with your unique perspective on their situations?&nbsp; EVERYONE needs encouragement and 'outside the box' thinking.&nbsp; This group can provide that encouragement and outside-the-box thinking.&nbsp; More importantly, you can provide that same fresh positive outlook to other group members.&nbsp; A rising tide raises all ships.&nbsp; So come join this rising tide of awesome people doing awesome things!&nbsp; Monroe Mann (Bio below, or Google him) and his fellow Break Divers will inspire you, encourage you, and force you to think in ways you never could have on your own.&nbsp; The result: your life is going to get a whole lot better. <br> <br><b>WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT AS A BREAK DIVING MEMBER:<\/b>&nbsp; <br>The basic framework of the group is meetings and get-togethers--&gt;inspirationally focused and moderated by motivational dynamo Monroe Mann, who many have called The Tony Robbins of the Entertainment World.&nbsp; Our meetings are ALWAYS inspiring; always hands-on and practical; always future focused (i.e. YOUR future); and sometimes have an adventure portion to them, i.e. a Citibike adventure in NYC that starts with a motivational pow-wow and finishes with an invigorating kick in the pants.&nbsp; <br> <br>The idea is that each Meetup will leave you encouraged and motivated, armed with solutions to whatever issues you are facing, and a battle plan for the next few weeks to tackle your goals and dreams.&nbsp; More often than not, you'll also make new friendships and reinforce old ones. &nbsp; <br> <span><br>Bottom line: the focus of Break Diving is simple--to guide members to become our best by inspiring one another to overcome difficult challenges on the road to reaching our dreams.&nbsp; In other words, this Meetup group's purpose is to help inspire you to DIVE into this crazy world and FIND YOUR BREAKS AND OPPORTUNITIES.&nbsp; We want you to become... a Break Diver!&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><b>Sound good?<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>If so, come join our collective of winners!&nbsp; If you are ready to grab life by the horns and finally do what you know you were meant to do, welcome to your new home, and welcome... to the first day of the rest of your life. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n<p><b>MODERATED BY:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> Monroe Mann, the founder of Break Diving, and a dude who epitomizes the philosophy of No Rules, No Excuses, No Regrets that he espouses.

Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.

As corporate America becomes more inclusive and further diversifies its supply chain, certification offers the opportunity for LGBT-owned businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors.<\/p>","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":68500742,"name":"Joe Renga","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/highres_248123136.jpeg","photo_id":248123136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/member_248123136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/thumb_248123136.jpeg"}},"members":194,"name":"New Jersey LGBT Chamber of Commerce","id":18757966,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-LGBT-Chamber-of-Commerce","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437503918000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LES-Writers-Salon\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Fiction writers, playwrights, and poets who want to get critiqued , get published, and make friends.<\/p> \n<p>No memoir writers please<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138438392,"name":"Ana Wieder Blank","photo":{"photo_id":185431662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/member_185431662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/thumb_185431662.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"LES  Writers Salon","id":18758170,"state":"NY","urlname":"LES-Writers-Salon","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437508595000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"exchangestud","name":"International and Exchange Students","id":3451},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/embracepotential-events\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.embracepotential.com\">Embrace Potential<\/a><\/b><span> provides monthly pro bono group coaching to international students in Greater New York City.&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;This is a pro bono service.

Members are encouraged to suggest activities, but general meetup locations will include uptown parks, baby movie matinees, yoga classes for moms and babies, etc.<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9519191,"name":"J","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/b\/1\/highres_247016497.jpeg","photo_id":247016497,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/b\/1\/member_247016497.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/b\/1\/thumb_247016497.jpeg"}},"members":106,"name":"Uptown Playdates","id":18763403,"state":"NY","urlname":"Uptown-Playdates","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437673829000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"vacation-condo-owners-exchange","name":"Vacation Condo Owners Exchange","id":18910},{"urlkey":"property-management","name":"Property Management","id":19086},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"hospitality-tourism","name":"Hospitality & Tourism","id":33114},{"urlkey":"making-money-with-rental-property","name":"Making Money with Rental Property","id":75850},{"urlkey":"homestays","name":"homestays","id":140807},{"urlkey":"vacation-rental-properties","name":"vacation rental properties","id":153610},{"urlkey":"short-term-rental-income","name":"Short Term Rental Income","id":153611},{"urlkey":"airbnb","name":"Airbnb","id":506892},{"urlkey":"microenterprise","name":"microenterprise","id":528132},{"urlkey":"supporting-the-local-economy","name":"Supporting the local economy","id":606772},{"urlkey":"holiday-rentals","name":"holiday rentals","id":1490602}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Airbnb-Host-and-Travelers-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a Meetup for all individuals who are hosts on Airbnb to share and exchange ideas.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master. So come and join us at our next meetup, learn self defense, meet some new people and have fun.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9792523,"name":"Kar Chen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/0\/4\/highres_6988932.jpeg","photo_id":6988932,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/0\/4\/member_6988932.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/0\/4\/thumb_6988932.jpeg"}},"members":127,"name":"Krav Maga of New York","id":18821416,"state":"NY","urlname":"Krav-Maga-of-New-York","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Krav Maga Combatants"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439260458000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"volleyball","name":"Volleyball","id":705},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Weeknights-Beach-Volleyball-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Intermediate\/Advance v-ball players who are interested in playing some beach volleyball on the weeknights.","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176823542,"name":"David Chuang","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/2\/0\/highres_246684352.jpeg","photo_id":246684352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/2\/0\/member_246684352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/2\/0\/thumb_246684352.jpeg"}},"members":80,"name":"New York Weeknights Beach Volleyball Meetup","id":18821467,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Weeknights-Beach-Volleyball-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Weeknight hitters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439278121000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"art","name":"Live Music","id":1502},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Sensational-Country-Blues-Wonders-Meetup-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>This is a group for those who like Blues, Country &amp; Gospel Music.<\/b> \"The Sensational Country Blues Wonders!\" are a unique entity in the NY\/NJ music scene.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

I thought to myself, maybe I should try Craigslist. The moment I started to comb through Craigslist for a roommate I got overwhelmed and simply gave up. I couldn't tell who was authentic or who was a bot. The first emails I sent left me bombarded with spam.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I tried two other sites that I will not mention here because it is not important but they could not deliver what I was expecting. Plus, the ritual of going back and forth instead of simply meeting and deciding within a short time and move on with my live was taking too much time. The frustration got to me and if you are here I believe you share this frustration. I have good news for you however. We can take the reins and take back control. Who says we need a third party to find you a roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This meetup will serve to find to find, professionals like yourself, &nbsp;a roommate that meets your expectations. The success of this meetup will be in direct correlation to your commitment in showing up and participating. Basically, do not waste my time as I will not waster yours.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>The format of the meetup will be the same each week and will be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>1. Pre-populated Questionnaire \u2013 You will only have to do this once and given that your criteria for a roommate does not change you won\u2019t have to do this ever again&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>2. First 10 minutes - Chat or mingle or whatever you New Yorkers want to call it.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>3. Then 20 minutes of \"algorithmically\" matching you up with a roommate. Basically, I will use the information from the questionnaire to match you up with a few people and you get to decide if you want to talk with this person or not.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4. Then another 25 minutes of you walking over and talking to someone that you think might be a great roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>5. 5 minutes wrap up. You get to hear the success stories of people who found their roommate for that session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/highres_440841330.jpeg","photo_id":440841330,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/600_440841330.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_440841330.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11996088,"name":"Alfie Walker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/highres_33106662.jpeg","photo_id":33106662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/member_33106662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/thumb_33106662.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Roommate Matchup for Professionals - New York City","id":18826991,"state":"NY","urlname":"Roommate-Matchup-for-Professionals-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Alfie"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439411717000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Womens-Cycling-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are many great women's cycling groups in NYC, but this one will focus on the LBTQ community.

One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks.

Members will benefit from face to face networking with peers, expanding local businesses, non-profits and government institutions to gain knowledge and insight into future employment as well career training opportunities. \n\n The New York & New Jersey Bilingual and Tech Career Network welcomes your thoughts, suggestions, and recommendations as well as sponsorship inquires and wishes success to all!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":190661066,"name":"Arthur Evans"},"members":19,"name":"New York & New Jersey Bilingual and Tech Career Network","id":18842346,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-New-Jersey-Bilingual-and-Tech-Career-Network","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439838895000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"aromatherapy","name":"Aromatherapy","id":3146},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Natural-Mind-Body-and-Spirit\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for people interested in nurturing the Mind, Body, and Spirit.

We don't have the luxury of wide open fields with no one around to bother. I am a member of a local aviation club, but it can take up an hour or longer each way to get there and it just isn't always practical. I like to fly small to larger airplanes as well. I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions. I have a whole series of future events and plans that I am working on but this is a simple start.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176296482,"name":"Daso"},"members":21,"name":"New York Radio Control Airplanes Meetup","id":18842509,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Radio-Control-Airplanes-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Flyers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439841130000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"flash-mobs","name":"Flash Mobs","id":25168},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"anything-and-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-do","name":"Anything and everything you've ever wanted to do.","id":56684},{"urlkey":"random-fun","name":"Random Fun","id":100994},{"urlkey":"a-little-bit-of-everything","name":"A little bit of everything","id":125692},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-adventure","name":"Spontaneous Adventure","id":169461},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-meetups","name":"Spontaneous Meetups","id":607482},{"urlkey":"any-spontaneous-fun-suggestions","name":"Any spontaneous fun suggestions!","id":1028392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Spontaneous-People\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is an experimental Meetup group for those of us who do things a bit more impromptu: we might wake up on a Saturday morning and decide to go rock climbing or hiking; or we thought we were going to have a mellow weekend but get a little restless.

I AM native to the high desert of central Mexico, of Toltec ancestry, born in the land of the Chichimeca. I recently relocated to New York from Los Angeles, CA. and I look forward to contributing sound vibration therapy as a healing art modality. I offer to guide my fellow sound alchemists into a beautiful dream through which we will all reach a zero point state of being. My intention for NY Sound Alchemy is to create a comfortable, invigorating, magical, mysterious, and healing \"sound-bath\/sound-scape\" for my guests. I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage & Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal & Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

I will teach you how to develop a strong sense of self, be self-contained, and be self-reliant. I encourage members to share themselves, and learn from each other.

So we will have meet ups that allow you to share a glass of wine and get pampered, while engaging in conversation and fun activities.","lon":-74.4400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9351951,"name":"Leah Dade","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/5\/c\/highres_249140828.jpeg","photo_id":249140828,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/5\/c\/member_249140828.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/5\/c\/thumb_249140828.jpeg"}},"members":68,"name":"Plainfield Professional Women Meetup","id":18868649,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Plainfield-Professional-Women-Meetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440549588000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cfs","name":"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","id":1457},{"urlkey":"scoliosis","name":"Scoliosis","id":1751},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"chronicpain","name":"Chronic Pain","id":3456},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"painmanage","name":"Pain Management","id":10429},{"urlkey":"chronicillness","name":"Chronic Illness","id":10479},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"conscious-movement","name":"Conscious Movement","id":18717},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"yoga-pilates-and-fitness","name":"Yoga, Pilates and Fitness","id":23768},{"urlkey":"autoimmune-disease","name":"Autoimmune Disease","id":24235},{"urlkey":"healing-through-movement","name":"Healing Through Movement","id":40497},{"urlkey":"managing-chronic-pain","name":"Managing Chronic Pain","id":48131}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Live-Pain-Free-BodyFix-Method-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This a group for anyone interested in improving their quality of life by living pain free.

They teach us our songs in many ways, for the different ways we learn, and help us to sound and look our best. If you like to sing, and would like to learn about barbershop singing, please give us a call. We rehearse every Thursday night from 7:15 until about 9:45 at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church on Hempstead Turnpike in Levittown. Our chorus is not affiliated with the church - we just rent space. We invite women who want to learn about this great hobby to visit us most any Thursday.

We could also just meet in a beautiful place like the Cloisters, Governor's Island, Lyndhurst's Rose Garden or Untermeyer Park for a picnic, enjoy a sunset in a dramatic landscape, or watch an outdoor movie. In winter or rainy weather we could visit a wing of the MET or explore the art in the metro, or even just meet for a drink in a speakeasy bar. Any activity can be an \u00ab&nbsp;excuse&nbsp;\u00bb to practice your French in a non-formal setting. The idea is to practice conversation with diversified topics\/environments and currents events, popular culture, politics, economics, news, etc. We can also discuss French literature and newspaper\/magazine articles and editorials.

Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities. Now is the time to join forces to protect, foster, and strengthen the local businesses in our neighborhoods that give us a sense of place, ensure our diverse culture, and provide us with strong unique communities we are proud to call home","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14366314,"name":"Karen Brown-Stovell"},"members":21,"name":"Newark Forward Ever Business Alliance Meetup","id":18889045,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Newark-Forward-Ever-Business-Alliance-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Localists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441121892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More-testing\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Tus us to nick si do belfry fleet bled Clift sm ni fb agog Cheryl varnish cleon Xbox sm bc clerk Clifty salud cl do all\u00edspey delito vi salvocorreo claro<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":151833872,"name":"Amy ","photo":{"photo_id":204896122,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/member_204896122.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/thumb_204896122.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"More testing","id":18889179,"state":"NY","urlname":"More-testing","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441122327000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"spark","name":"Spark","id":360491},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"apache-spark","name":"Apache spark","id":1471442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spark-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"NYC Spark users group for those interested in distributed computing technologies.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":117500482,"name":"Matthew Hunt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/highres_229314142.jpeg","photo_id":229314142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/member_229314142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/thumb_229314142.jpeg"}},"members":396,"name":"New York Spark Meetup","id":18889202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Spark-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sparkies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441135114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223},{"urlkey":"social-philanthropy","name":"Social Philanthropy","id":113816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BE-A-FRIEND-Walkathon-2015\/","rating":0,"description":"Join friends, family members and colleagues as you walk, run or stroll along beautiful Hudson River Park in support of Samaritans 24-hour Suicide Prevention Center at our 2nd Annual BE A FRIEND 5K Walkathon, Saturday, September 19.
