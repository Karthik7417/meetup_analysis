We also celebrated the 7th Anniversary of Earth Drum Circle. A large number of drummers showed up for the occasion and we had some really great drumming going on. See below for audio track links. Additionally, I have included audio track links from the Roundhouse at Brushwood Folklore Center from my trip there in July.<\/p> <p>The date of our next Earth Drum Circle in Central Park at Cherry Hill will be Saturday, September 12th.

'green\/spring onion' in Korean. It is a pancake-like Korean dish made from a batter of eggs, wheat flour, rice flour, green onions, and often other additional ingredients depending on the variety. Beef, pork, kimchi, shellfish, and other seafood are mostly used. If one of these ingredients, such as squid, dominates the jeon, the name will reflect that; ojing'eo jeon (\uc624\uc9d5\uc5b4\uc804) is 'squid jeon.'<\/p> <p>Pajeon is usually recognizable by the highly visible green onions. It is similar to a Chinese green onion pancake in appearance but is less dense in texture and not made from a dough. It is not to be confused with bindaetteok, which is a mung bean pancake.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/c\/5\/600_440608357.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are also trying to make Makgeolli Cocktail (Korean Rice Wine Cocktail) which goes really good with Pajeon.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/b\/600_441573931.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Makgeolli<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hangul\">hangul<\/a>: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/%EB%A7%89\">\ub9c9<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/%EA%B1%B8\">\uac78<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/%EB%A6%AC\">\ub9ac<\/a>), also known as \"makkoli\", \"makoli\", \"makguli\", \"makgoli\", or \"makuly (takju)\", is an alcoholic beverage native to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korea\">Korea<\/a>. It is made from rice or wheat mixed with <i>nuruk<\/i>, a Korean <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermentation_starter\">fermentation starter<\/a>.

Makgeolli is traditionally made from rice, although variations are made from wheat, and some brands are flavored with corn, chestnut, apple or other produce.<\/p> <p>The name <i>makgeolli<\/i> has its origin in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_language\">Korean language<\/a>, in which it is a compound that consists of a prefix <i>mak-<\/i> (\"roughly, coarsely, recklessly, carelessly\") and a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deverbal_noun\">deverbal noun<\/a> derived from the verb <i>georeu-<\/i> ~ <i>geoll-<\/i> (\"to strain, to sift, to filter\"). It was originally quite popular among farmers, earning it the name <i><b>nongju<\/b><\/i> (\ub18d\uc8fc \/ \u8fb2\u9152), which means farmer liquor. However, it has recently become more popular in cities, especially with the younger generations. <i>Dongdongju<\/i> (\ub3d9\ub3d9\uc8fc) is a drink very similar to makgeolli, and both are commonly imbibed alongside Korean pancakes such as <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pajeon\">pajeon<\/a><\/i> (\ud30c\uc804) or <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bindaetteok\">bindaetteok<\/a><\/i> (\ube48\ub300\ub5a1).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n***Please Note***<\/p> <p>- Must be over 21 since we are making Rice Wine cocktail.

She enjoys a challenging, fast-paced career as a lobbyist, and Dave, her long-term boyfriend, loves her. And yet at 36 years old, she's ready to move on to the next phase. Marriage and a family seem like a logical and welcome step. However, Dave is not so sure. A bit of a commitment phobic, his misgivings lead to a painful break-up. Enter Carter Duncan, a handsome, charming stranger whose path keeps crossing with Leah's. Caring and solicitous of Leah and her family and friends, their relationship rapidly progresses. It seems like Leah has met the perfect guy. But it seems too good to be true. Soon his protective nature morphs into something much more sinister. It's clear that Leah has to end this new relationship and when she does, her onetime lover becomes her ultimate enemy.

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later!

If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

The only thing uglier than the environmental devastation, was the institutional racism that poisoned the town and the clean up effort. Based on true events and the novel, America is Still the Place, by Charlie Walker.<\/p> <p>The film features the unforgettable performance of Mike Colter, star of Marvel\u2019s brand new Netflix series, Luke Cage, who will join director Patrick Gilles for a discussion and Q&amp;A after the film.<\/p> <p>This event is co-sponsored by the Harlem Community Development Corporation.<\/p> <p>Saturday, September 12 @ 7 pm<\/p> <p>America is Still the Same Place<\/p> <p><br\/>Trailer:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/116602949\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/116602949<\/a><\/p> <p>__________________________________________________<\/p> <p>Other films showing on other days include:<\/p> <p>Story of Our Lives<br\/>Trailer<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DaDs333V-vo\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DaDs333V-vo<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Zemene<br\/>Trailer:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C9kMhjFE4v4&amp;feature=youtu.be\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C9kMhjFE4v4&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blacktvandfilmcollective\/events\/225083296\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":12600000,"name":"Attend Harlem International Film Festival","id":"225083296","time":1442097000000,"updated":1442889438000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435088912000,"name":"The Black TV and Film Collective","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":18693982,"urlname":"blacktvandfilmcollective","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Storytellers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11361","country":"us","city":"Bayside","phone":"718-463-3434","address_1":"214-26 41st Avenue","name":"Queens Dance Project ","lon":-73.770439,"id":1061273,"state":"NY","lat":40.763535,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5525102615,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441673133000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our next <b>Saturday Night Dance Social<\/b> will be held on <b>Saturday, September 12th!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/f\/2\/600_439031250.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Event Details:<\/b><\/p> <p>The evening will begin with a fun absolute beginner Introduction to Dancing Class from 7-7:30pm, new dancers will be taught the basic steps to some of the most popular dances!<\/p> <p>We will have an open level dance workshop from 7:30-9pm.

But hikers and mountaineers often dream of another prominent feature: Mount Kilimanjaro. Nicknamed the Rooftop of Africa, this massive peak is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. At 19,340 ft Kilimanjaro presents complete contrasts in traditional mountaineering environments. Just south of the Equator, this snow-topped stratovolcano towers above the surrounding landscape. Close to the summit lies the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier, a small remnant of an enormous icecap which once crowned the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. However, the receding glaciers are expected to disappear completely within the next decade.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll travel through multiple climatic zones to the formidable Kilimanjaro on the Machame route and enjoy some of the most impressive vistas that Africa has to offer. Summiting the Rooftop of Africa is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/224633113\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytmbrb","time":1442149200000,"updated":1442162448000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Staten Island","address_1":"Staten Island Rd's","name":"Fields all over Staten Island ","lon":-74.102333,"id":21654102,"state":"NY","lat":40.607231,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.510723114,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437499347000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Register now to reserve a team.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

The Blind Spot is committed to making the language and critical thinking skills around privilege, race and oppression more commonplace.

The goal is to grow in our understanding of these issues both intellectually and emotionally.<\/p> <p>Society members will be invited to participate in The Blind Spot series hosted by NYSEC and guided by Russell G.

Practice the proper way to access vital points of the body. Understand how to attack the body's nervous system via pressure points. Learn how to use this knowledge for pain compliance and body reaction. Control opponent using minimal strength. Kyusho (Vital Point Arts) is gaining widespread International support and integration into most Martial Arts styles. This Ancient system of Vital Point Manipulation can be utilized for so many aspects of your life from healing to self-defense. Correct training is needed to insure the proper use of this once secret information. It will enhance your potential and depth of understanding in an easy to learn progressive process. As well as integrating it into YOUR personal Style! Kyusho is the study of the weaker anatomical structures of the human body. They are targets that are located on Nervous and Vascular (sometimes both) structures. Because these targets are affecting these systems, we are actually attacking the internal body as opposed to the external structure. The external body was designed by nature to take abuse, from strikes, falls, torn tissue, etc. What it isn't designed or adapted to is attacks on the internal structure and functions, precisely why Kyusho has such devastating and predictable effect. You will realize the benefits for personal, family, and friends in not one, but all areas of pressure point studies.

(You can order an advance copy on Amazon now.)<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIn his book, Silverman describes what he means by \u201cfirebrand Atheist\u201d and why it is more effective than politely accepting the encroachment of religion into every nook and cranny of American life--and he backs up his assertions with statistical data.\u00a0 \u201cTelling people that god doesn\u2019t exist and that religion is a lie is not only effective, but downright nice,\u201d is Silverman\u2019s philosophy.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNice? Can telling people what they don\u2019t want to hear ever be considered \u201cnice?\u201d Silverman explains that he means \u201ctelling the truth to people who are not Atheists. Religion is more than just wrong. It is malevolent and does not deserve our respect.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNice\u201d describes the ultimate positive effects on the speaker of telling truth to people who have been misled by religious indoctrination.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Does It Work?<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAuthor Richard Dawkins says: \u201c...David Silverman is the bad boy of atheism and we need people like him. He is not afraid to speak the truth, sans apology.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\nInternational Atheist Taslima Nasrin gives kudos to Silverman\u2019s book: \u201cA sometimes funny, always informative look into the mind behind America\u2019s frontline of atheism. Dave reminds us that religion is everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSilverman, who was raised a Jew, says he managed to resist the indoctrination into Judaism he was given and realized he was a nonbeliever at age six. In college, he often engaged in debates with Orthodox Jews and became friends with many of his opponents-- eventually marrying one of them. The book \u201cFighting god\u201d is dedicated to his formerly-orthodox wife of nearly 25 years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Going on Book Tour<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAfter college, Silverman worked as a professional inventor at Bell Labs for eight years and was issued 74 patents--a remarkable feat that may demonstrate his extraordinary ability to think outside the box. Today Silverman devotes his time to running AA and trying to change the world. He will be touring many cities in the U.S. and abroad (coming up soon, Heidelberg, Germany)\u00a0 to talk about his book.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCome to the NYCA Brunch on Sunday and hear this remarkable American Atheist who has had the courage to earn the accolade of \u201cfirebrand.\u201d\u00a0 Come and enjoy, with friendly like-minded people, a hearty breakfast while listening to what is happening today on the cutting edge of Atheism.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>EVENT SUMMARY<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHAT:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHOW--AND WHY--YOU SHOULD BE A FIREBRAND ATHEIST,\u201d a \u00a0 \u00a0talk by\u00a0<\/b><b>David Silverman, president of American Atheists Inc. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHEN: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SUNDAY, September 13, 2015,\u00a0 at 12 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>WHERE: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 THE PRESS BOX (2ND FLOOR) - <\/b><b>932 Second Ave.\u00a0<\/b><b>(Bet. 49th &amp; 50th Streets.<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>COST:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/b> <b>BRUNCH\u00a0is $20, including buffet\u00a0<\/b><b>entrees, salad, soft drink, coffee\u00a0<\/b><b>tax and tip.\u00a0 We encourage going\u00a0<\/b><b>for\u00a0 seconds!<\/b><\/p> <p>===================================<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"2ND FLOOR","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atheists-24\/events\/224892209\/","yes_rsvp_count":54,"name":"NYC ATHEISTS BRUNCH: 'FIREBRAND' DAVE SILVERMAN OPENS UP!","id":"jmzzhlytmbrb","time":1442160000000,"updated":1442243810000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035947374000,"name":"New York City Atheists Meetings","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12907,"urlname":"atheists-24","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Atheists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"22 West 32nd St - 10th Floor - Room J","name":"Magnet Training Center (32nd street between 5th & 6h)","lon":-73.986946,"id":24082526,"state":"NY","lat":40.747513,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":0.235273569822,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438059051000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a weekly introductory improv class taught Sundays from 12pm-3pm.<\/p> <p>-- Are you a bit shy and looking to get more comfortable with your public speaking?\u00a0<\/p> <p>-- Are you a working professional hoping to be a bit more spontaneous during your meetings and interactions with co-workers?\u00a0<\/p> <p>-- Or are you an actor or improv comedian looking to take your craft to the next level or get more reps?<\/p> <p>Then this is the class for you!

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225136476\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflytmbrb","time":1442160000000,"updated":1442172604000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Pier 66 Boathouse","address_2":"26th St. & 12th Ave., Hudson River Park","name":"New York Outrigger","lon":-73.999164,"id":5605082,"state":"NY","lat":40.753685,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0.544244349003,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1441221953000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get on the water in NYC!\u00a0 Come experience outrigger paddling for free.<\/p> <p><b>This event will have outrigger paddling. \u00a0SUP paddling may be added before the event. \u00a0Check the comments field below for updates.<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is open to the public on a first come, first served basis.<\/p> <p><b>RSVPing to this meeup does not guarantee you a spot.<\/b><\/p> <p>However, your acknowledgement helps us plan our day to make sure we get you on the water as quickly as possible!<\/p> <p><b>A completed waiver is required for participation.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/newyorkoutrigger.wufoo.com\/forms\/new-york-outrigger-2015-novice-waiver\/\">Click here to fill out the waiver.<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>We paddle rain or shine except when there is\u00a0lightening.\u00a0 Remember to wear sunscreen and to bring a bottle of water in the canoe to stay hydrated.

If you are interested in the program or know of someone that would be, please contact me to find out more and register. [masked]<br\/>This training may challenge you in your life as it shakes up our perspective and gets us more in tuned with our selves.

Here are the details that may help you decide if this is the right program for you.<br\/>1. We will start the program close to the Autumn Equinox and will continue for 12 months full circle with a final initiation ceremony at the end of our cycle.<br\/>2. Your commitment to the program will be $1200 for the full year and this fee will include the following.<br\/>\u2022 4 Intensive weekend workshops ending with a final Rites of Passage event.

However, Becker holds that much contemporary reasoning about ethics is lacking: \"We think that ethics too often proceeds with unjustified confidence that the assemblage of assumptions and logical operations it employs are clear and adequate for its purposes.\" So, being a modern Stoic who wishes to use the best modern tools for the job, he brings the tools of modern formal logic to bear on the question.<\/p> <p>He then proceeds to update the ancient Stoic summary of their philosophy, to \"live in agreement with nature,\" in Chapter 5. By this, ancient Stoics meant roughly two things. One is to live in agreement with human nature, which tends to be rational and social. However, they also took \"nature\" to be a teleological system which strove toward an end. Many modern Stoics can agree to the first dictum, but not the second. So how can a modern Stoic salvage and reform Stoicism to fit our modern idea of the way nature actually works? This is the question Lawrence Becker tackle in Chapter 5. Becker reinterprets the classical Stoic dictum as \"one should follow the facts.\" Chapter 5 fleshes out this idea and its implications for a modern Stoic.<\/p> <p>However, the devil's in the details, and there are a lot of details to flesh out in these two chapters. We'll do so together in this meetup. To prepare, please read Chapters 4 and 5 and come prepared with passages that were either unclear to you or you found interesting and would like to discuss. To assist you in your reading, study questions are posted below. Attempting to answer them while you read may help you digest some of the key concepts more easily. We'll also answer and discuss many of them at the meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These are perhaps the most difficult chapters in <i>A New Stoicism<\/i>, but can be quite rewarding for at least two reasons: they lay a rigorous, rational groundwork for a modern Stoic philosophy, and there's a good chance you'll learn a lot about modern analytic philosophy by struggling through these chapters.

However, Becker holds that much contemporary reasoning about ethics is lacking: \"We think that ethics\u00a0too often proceeds with unjustified confidence that the\u00a0assemblage of assumptions and logical operations it employs\u00a0are clear and adequate for its purposes.\" So, being a modern Stoic who wishes to use the best modern tools for the job, he brings the tools of modern formal logic to bear on the question.<\/p> <p>He then proceeds to update the ancient Stoic summary of their philosophy, to\u00a0\"live in agreement with nature,\" in Chapter 5. By this, ancient Stoics meant roughly two things. One is to live in agreement with human nature, which tends to be rational and social. However, they also took \"nature\" to be a teleological system which strove toward an end. Many modern Stoics can agree to the first dictum, but not the second. So how can a modern Stoic salvage and reform Stoicism to fit our modern idea of the way nature actually works?\u00a0This is the question Lawrence Becker tackle in Chapter 5. Becker reinterprets the classical Stoic dictum as \"one should follow the facts.\" Chapter 5 fleshes out this idea and its implications for a modern Stoic.<\/p> <p>However, the devil's in the details, and there are a lot of details to flesh out in these two chapters. We'll do so together in this meetup. To prepare, please read Chapters 4 and 5 and come prepared with passages that were either unclear to you or you found interesting and would like to discuss. To assist you in your reading, study questions are posted below. Attempting to answer them while you read may help you digest some of the key concepts more easily. We'll also answer and discuss many of them at the meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These are perhaps the most difficult chapters in\u00a0<i>A New Stoicism<\/i>, but can be quite rewarding for at least two reasons: they lay a rigorous, rational groundwork for a modern Stoic philosophy, and there's a good chance you'll learn a lot about modern analytic philosophy by struggling through these chapters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll also set aside some time at the end of the meetup to discuss personal Stoic practice to balance out Becker's theory with some practice.<\/p> <p>See you there!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Focus questions<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Chapter 4<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is the goal of the logic sketched out in Chapter 4\u00a0<br\/>and detailed in the appendix?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What is the difference between norms and normative\u00a0<br\/>propositions?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What are the three normative operators used in Becker's\u00a0<br\/>logic?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What does \"ought\" mean according to Becker?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What does a \"requirement\" mean in Becker's logic?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What does indifference mean?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0How does one reason from means and ends to oughts?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0How does one reason from commitments to requirements?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0How does one reason from standards to ought-nots?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What are the four major axioms of Stoic normative logic?\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Chapter 5<\/i><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How has Becker reinterpreted \"follow nature?\"\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0How would you summarize the axiom of futility?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0Why connect all norms to facts about the projects or\u00a0<br\/>endeavors of individual agents?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0Why does Stoic ethical reasoning put the focus on actual\u00a0<br\/>human beings and not hypothetical, idealized, or\u00a0<br\/>schematic ones?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0Can normative propositions or norms generated from two\u00a0endeavors conflict?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What are integrated and isolated endeavors?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What is the difference between a dictatorial and \u00a0tyrannical endeavor?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What is \"reformative assessment\"?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What is practical reason?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 What Stoic ethical axioms represent practical reasoning?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0How do people tend to integrate interpersonal norms, and\u00a0what's the Stoic view on complete integration of these\u00a0norms?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0Where does motivation come from?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0Briefly describe the five stages of <i>oikeiosis<\/i> and what it\u00a0<br\/>attempts to portray.\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What are heteronomous motivations?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What are heteronomous ends?<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What does Becker mean when he says that agency is robust?\u00a0<br\/>\u2022\u00a0What is meant by an agent being responsible for their\u00a0<br\/>actions?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>(if you would like to study <i>A New Stoicism<\/i>\u00a0with us, but purchasing the book presents a significant financial burden, please message Greg to discuss getting a copy of the book for you)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Stoics\/events\/224769206\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"A New Stoicism II","id":"224769206","time":1442167200000,"updated":1442181563000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357619798000,"name":"New York City Stoics","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6549102,"urlname":"New-York-City-Stoics","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Stoics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441135378000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/0\/4\/600_441548964.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come by Neolyth Sept 13th. we will be holding an open house for our Shamanic training program.

In the workshop series, we will do exercises to master each of the 4 agreements (Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions, Always Do Your Best), learn healing techniques to release fear at the cell level, and create a community of support and action moving toward creating our new dream with awareness.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Each workshop will have a topic related to one of the agreements, exercises or games, and open time for support, a closing ceremony and homework to integrate into daily life. It will be fun, uplifting, powerful and supportive group which will meet bi-weekly.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can go to all the classes or pop in to any one, because they will each be complete in their own way and do not progress in a specific order or sequence. All the agreements are addressed over and over again from different aspects, and different exercises, tools etc are shared to help integrate each one into daily life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Workshops will all vary, but will include:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>- Practical tools to integrate the wisdom of The Four Agreements to transform your life<br\/>- Ancient Toltec Dreaming &amp; Recapitulation techniques to get to master your attention, shift your beliefs and re-write your story<br\/>- Healing modalities to heal fears and stuck energy at the cell level<br\/>- Games and exercises to break patterns and increase energy<br\/>- Community and ongoing support for your journey to yourself<br\/>- Closing ceremony and take home tools to continue the work in your life.<br\/>- Light Refreshments provided<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> $20.00 \/ Workshop or $100.00 for 6 Workshops<\/p> <p><b>Facilitated by Christine Vida<\/b><\/p> <p>Christine Vida is a Transformative Life Coach who has been on the Toltec Path since 2005, has been on over a dozen power journeys with don Miguel Ruiz and apprentices, and has facilitated workshops since 2007.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with 6x12 Goals.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

It is not only to carry on our regular topics on LoVE, but more importantly to carry on the support I envisioned us to form for each other as a group, the duty I\u00a0shouldered on,\u00a0and the expectations\u00a0the\u00a0group\u00a0members\u00a0have\u00a0and\u00a0continue having for this meetup! \u00a0<\/p> <p>So, let's do it, again!<\/p> <p>I would like to hear your experiences, stories, lessons and struggles in life during this Summer. What have you done, where have you been... How are you doing now?... Do you miss us?<\/p> <p>In this meeting, we will catch up, warm up, and plan for the future topics and activities in the Fall and Winter season.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please come and join us, just like before.\u00a0<\/p> <p>ps.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/225298781\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Sunday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"225298781","time":1442178000000,"updated":1442200210000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"08861","country":"us","city":"Perth Amboy","address_1":"214 Smith St Suite 201","name":"Tariqa Burhaniya ","lon":-74.272001,"id":4686332,"state":"NJ","lat":40.50979,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.2743701935,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430066261000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Assalaamu 'alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu,<\/p> <p>I pray to Allah that this email reaches you while you are in the highest status of Iman and happiness and enjoying the blessings of health and peace of mind.The \u00a0Hadra (zikr) starts at 5:30PM Insha Allah which is follow by a light snack Insha Allah and lesson.\u00a0 See you at the dhikr insha Allah.<\/p> <p>***Please email us if you are coming for the first time so we can open the lobby door.***<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/img2.meetupstatic.com\/981263258369601089\/img\/smileys\/smile.gif\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/a\/0\/event_139030912.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TariqaBurhaniyaNJ\/events\/222110900\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Weekly Hadra (Meditation) and learn about Islam and Sufism","id":"sjnsglytmbrb","time":1442179800000,"updated":1442192995000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1322791510000,"name":"Tariqa Burhaniya - NJ Chapter","group_lon":-74.2799987793,"id":2892992,"urlname":"TariqaBurhaniyaNJ","group_lat":40.5200004578,"who":"Sufi"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":32,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440480593000,"fee":{"amount":160,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":7,"average":4.71000003815},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>PHOTOGRAPHERS!<\/p> <p><br\/>ANNOUNCING AMERICAN AIRPOWER MUSEUM 8! \u00a0- \u00a0<i>Wings of Desire!<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>(it's a classic movie from the '80s - look it up!)<\/p> <p>Join us for one of the most popular shoots we do all year!

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Last year, Mike amazed DNNY viewers with footage of flying discs similar to the NASA Tether video but . . . this was at \u201crooftop\u201d level with super clear night vision. Mike has more rare night vision UFO footage to share. Unable to hide from the night vision scope,\u00a0 these objects demonstrate unique aerial movements that defy conventional methods of propulsion. The night is alive with fleets, discs and fake star constellations.<\/p> <p>Geoff Brady (youtube - budgetmoon) presented high color, footage of UFO's, so clear that it prompted some attending a recent DNNY event to shout \"photoshop!\" and another attendee literally fell off her chair. That's right, things are not as they seem. Flying manta rays, striped cylinders, stationary glowing spheres are some of the highlights in this presentation. Prepare to have your perspective and bearings challenged again.<\/p> <p>Bios: Both Mike&amp; Geoff are long time UFO observers and eye witnesses of UFO's in the skies over NYC. They have presented among the clearest high quality authentic UFO footage over New York City. It's not easy work to get the real footage presented. It comes with a price. Both Mike and Geoff been publicly attacked by trolls and individuals with disinformation agendas. Type \"budgetmoon\" into google. What's the first video that comes up? Someone copied Mike's entire youtube channel. They had to download and upload his (50 plus videos) onto their own channel.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.
