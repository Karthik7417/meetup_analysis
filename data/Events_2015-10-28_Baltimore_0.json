If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2.

Of course you could sit at home and watch the game on ESPN, but you will have WAY more fun if you join us at Odie\u2019s.<\/p> <p>The Chiefs lost to Denver on Thursday night and will have had 10 days to prepare for their match up with the Packers. And Green Bay will welcome back Andy Reid (Head Coach for Kansas City), who spent the seven years of his NFL coaching career there. But once the pleasant greetings are over, it will be all business for the Packers, who will be looking for their 3rd win on the season.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP here on this page to let us know that you will be joining us on Monday night. We will be having a great time cheering our Packers on to another victory! Can you say Rodgers to Rodgers? GO PACK GO!

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

Lol<\/p> <p>Hello All! I have finally gotten a new location for this rescheduled Meetup to expand our practice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let's make more money by doing what we love! I was recently told Jeff Young, the founding father of the MD Chapter of the AMTA, used to say, \"At any given time, there is a new client 10 feet away from us\". Isn't that true when we are out and about? It's called networking. We have the privilege of having another founding father of one of the biggest business networking organizations in the state of Maryland, speak with us about what it means for our business\/practice to network. His name is Jerry Schwartz. Jerry is one of the most positive, nicest and unstoppable people I know! He assisted us, myself and Bill Pearce, in establishing the Downtown Chapter of BNI, Business Networking International, back in the late 90's. After we got going, I doubled my income through this illustrious group of businessmen and women. Jerry has agreed to share the wealth of why and how networking is so vital to building our massage practices. Also, if you are hungry, Barcocina (www.barcocina.com) has a very interesting menu to select from .\u00a0 Again,\u00a0Jerry Schwartz usually gets $500 per speaking engagement and he is doing this for us for no charge. Therefore, I don't want to abuse the privilege of having him speak to such a small crowd. \u00a0If we do not get a reasonable response, I will cancel again, assuming that this is not a topic everyone is interested in.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>8\/18\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/25\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>9\/1 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09\/8\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/22\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>10\/6 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/13\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/20\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/27\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>11\/3\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011\/10\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/17\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/24\u00a0\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>12\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

I've eaten enough crab cakes in and around the City to know that \"Who makes the best crab cakes?\" is a question with no right answer, or rather, that \"best\" is a circumstantial prospect.<\/p> <p>For instance, if you're an intrepid tourist, you're well-advised to bypass Phillips and other overpriced spots at the Inner Harbor and make your way to Faidley's in run-down but locally beloved Lexington Market. The Market closes at 6, so Faidley's jumbo lump crab cakes would be your choice for lunch.<\/p> <p>Or, if you know the City, and it's late at night, and you're not afraid of fogged-in dark places where bad things happen, taxi over to Jimmy's Famous Seafood on Holabird, down by the Marine Terminal. Opened in 1974 by Demetrios \"Jimmy\" Minadakis, this Greek family restaurant has promoted tons of crab and oceans of Imperial sauce to people whose expectations had better be met. Don't be alarmed by all the Caddies and Town Cars in the parking lot; the Mob eats elsewhere.<\/p> <p>Family visits and fishing trips occasionally take me through Baltimore, and because it's close to the airport (in another dodgy industrial area; that's Baltimore...) I have eaten my weight in crab cakes from G&amp;M Restaurant and Carry Out.<\/p> <p>G&amp;M crab cakes are huge. They're the sort of crab cakes about which people exaggerate: \"as big as my face;\" \"As big as your head;\" \"As big as a boat.\" At $28 the pair, they're as costly as a boat, but each cake truly is the size of my fist, and since I pay $30 or more per pound for blue crab meat in San Diego, I figure G&amp;M's price is about right.<\/p> <p>G&amp;M uses jumbo lump blue crab, and their crab cake mixture contains very little filler, notwithstanding Internet rumors it is adulterated with pollock. As the kids say: \"Haters gonna hate.\"<\/p> <p>The restaurant uses 7000 pounds of crab a week, mostly from Venezuela, a sore point with the \"Maryland True Blue Crabs\" campaigners, but to my enthusiastic, judgmental and hard-to-please taste buds, as long as it's blue crab, it's just fine.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Besides, a study released in March 2015 by Oceana (a non-profit ocean advocacy group) described finding mislabeled crab cakes in every city it tested (the mixture being partly or wholly comprised of some completely different crab species), including 46 percent in Baltimore. At least G&amp;M is honest about their product.<\/p> <p>And what a product it is! \u00a0G&amp;M crab cakes are a little buttery, a little sweet, lightly browned on top, and never gummy or dry. \u00a0They're the gold standard for such food, and I'm happy to have been a G&amp;M customer for going on twenty years. \u00a0<\/p> <p>- \u00a0Posted by Yelp reviewer Omar S.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55\/events\/225271112\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Let's Continue Our Search for the Best Crab Cake in Baltimore","id":"225271112","time":1443740400000,"updated":1443815700000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422713755000,"name":"Towson Area Inquisitive Women over 55","group_lon":-76.5800018311,"id":18398926,"urlname":"Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55","group_lat":39.4099998474,"who":"Curious women over 55."},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"Will send address to RSVP's","name":"Kate's House ","lon":-76.61219,"id":16590442,"lat":39.290386,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":0.419541269541,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440874418000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This book has received a lot of rave reviews and praise.

Ferrante\u2019s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Growing up on these tough streets the two girls learn to rely on each other ahead of anyone or anything else. As they grow, as their paths repeatedly diverge and converge, Elena and Lila remain best friends whose respective destinies are reflected and refracted in the other. They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists, the unforgettable Elena and Lila.<\/i><\/p> <p><i> Ferrante is the author of three previous works of critically acclaimed fiction: The Days of Abandonment, Troubling Love, and The Lost Daughter. With this novel, the first in a trilogy, she proves herself to be one of Italy\u2019s great storytellers.

And they did not disappoint! The resulting short films run the gamut of sexual styles: straight, gay, lesbian, transgender... every color in the sexual rainbow... and some we never knew existed. HUMP! films are funny, thought-provoking, sad, artistic, outrageous, and almost overwhelmingly sexy-because they're real. And they're real because they were created and performed by sex-positive people, just like YOU. That's why we're bringing the very best of HUMP! to your town!

<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/6\/e\/event_139181582.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>One of the best kept secrets here just north of Towson is the public access to a \"protected\" area of Loch Raven Reservoir park on the weekend.\u00a0 On both Saturday and Sunday, park police close off Loch Raven Drive (some maps call it Loch Raven Rd.) between Morgan Mill Road and Providence Road. The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park.

We will learn about the cutting edge modality of Equine Assisted Psychotherapy, and how it enhances in-office therapy with a case history.

But when her sister goes missing, Xandra will set out on a path that undermines everything she believed in and uncover a conspiracy that threatens to topple the empire.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

He has managed sales teams as few as 5 and as many as 120 and revenue from $5M to $130M before becoming CEO of a private equity backed company. Despite the tough economic slide of 2008, his business grew from $12M to $20M in a four-year period, while his competitors saw losses of up to 30% of their historical revenues.<\/p> <p><br\/>As a resident of Annapolis since 2000, Steve\u2019s desire to get out of the corporate boardroom and help small and mid-tier businesses has led him to acquire his own business based in the Annapolis Exchange Building off Jennifer Road. His business, Maryland Sales Training &amp; Management Development relies on Steve\u2019s field expertise in business leadership positions. His interactive training is based on his real-world success and the Sandler Training programs, rated as the top training program by Entrepreneur Magazine for the past eleven years.<\/p> <p><br\/>The core values taught by Steve rely on the power of reinforcement, role-play and real life examples. These are not one-shot seminars, but planned frequent training modules designed to take the sales team through the techniques necessary to avoid the traditional Buyer\/Seller dance, prospect more efficiently and create a formal plan to logically follow the sales path to a decision.<\/p> <p><br\/>Steve conducts both \u201cpublic\u201d and private engagements with his clients.

This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

Write contents on all cartons. Don't abbreviate. And if there is primarily one subject in the carton, write that on the box as well.

With plenty of attractions from the Sword Swallower, the story of William Tell, glass blowing, Jousting, arts and crafts for sale and tons of food, it's a good place to step back in time and have some fun and get some good photos. It's not unusual to see some very well thought out costumes and some not so well thought out ones, but it's a lot of fun. Now, this is a paid location. As of right now, it's $24 per adult (16-61), senior is $20.\u00a0 Gates open at 10, I'm thinking that 10:30AM would be the best option so we can avoid the hassle of parking...which, is on a very, very large field for anyone who has not been there. A word of advice: Bring cash or check. Very few of the vendors take credit card. There are ATM's though the fees are obviously not very good. Also, when photographing anyone who works there, please make sure to ask for their permission. The last time I was there this past labor day, my niece was getting her face painted. I went to get a shot of her and the person running the booth had asked that I not take any photos even though I was just trying to get her face. That was a bit rare but just something to keep in mind. Most folks there are very polite and don't mind their photo being taken.<\/p> <p>We'll meet in front of the ticket area.

We will check people in, fill out forms, and meet our guides at 4pm. We'll get a safety briefing, get harnessed, and then we're off having fun at 5pm. We have access to the course until 8pm!<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Zipline -<\/b> We'll experience the thrill of gliding through the trees 30 feet in the air at speeds of up to 20 mph as we soar on a 330 foot zip line. The park's Adventure Guides will make our experience memorable as we see the forest from a different point of view. First, we'll climb a ladder and cross a cable to get to the zipline platform. Then we'll take off and use gravity to propel us. We'll zipline to one end and halfway back again to end up safely on the ground.

Each of the 19 traverses is designed to entertain and challenge participants. Try the islands in the sky, vine walk, raider bridge, heebie jeebie, or Tyrolean traverse to name a few. Let's conquer them all if we can! We can climb down, be lowered on a static belay, or test ourselves on the leap of faith.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/214400\/climbingwall.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>Climbing Tower -<\/b>\u00a0We can scale all 12 routes up and down the 43 foot high climbing tower. This is not your ordinary climbing gym. The views are great from the top where we can rest and relax under the canopy roof and see the Little Patuxent River as it winds past the course.\u00a0The\u00a0routes up and down include some that are flat for beginners and an overhang route for more advanced climbers. For more fun, there is a vertical playpen with many exciting and challenging elements like the cargo net, rope ladder, climbing log, firecracker, centipede, and tire \/ dangle duo that will enhance our climbing experience. For a truly unique descent, we can climb headfirst down the Rainbow Serpent or descend via the tube net.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/h8TJvqejba8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/h8TJvqejba8<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Flyer Jump -<\/b> Love a thrill? This is the thrill of all thrills when we get the feeling of a free fall from 40 feet in the air.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long).

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category.
