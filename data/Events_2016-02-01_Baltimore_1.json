I am gracious for the companionship in learning and in constantly\u00a0 reminding myself how to release fear, and experience peace, joy and direction in my life. I am grateful for the gift of living more in the Now, and less in the past and future. I hope you too will have an easier and lighter journey, filled with laughter and joy by making the Course principles part of your daily life. Welcome to the study group. If you have any suggestions or needs, please let me know. I have participated in about 10 different meeting groups around the country to learn, and have borrowed some of their formats. I am not a scholar, nor an expert- I do not have the material memorized. I merely study with the group, and the effects on my life have been profound. I do not require participants to prepare for the meetings. Some people do the daily lessons at home, which are highly recommended. Some people read the chapter ahead of time to get an overview. It is nice to have your own book, but this is not mandatory for learning.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a012\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0 12\/29\u00a0 Stephen Clarke<\/p> <p>1\/5\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/12\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/26\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>2\/2\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\/9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/23\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>3\/1 \u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/8 \u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Need more effective ways to uncover the other\u2019s real desires and minimize scene failure? Want to better communicate your hungers and get better play? Dissatisfied with scenes or frustrated at not having your desire accepted? How do you create a multi person scene where everyone's happy? Join Midori in this popular and unique class where she explodes the standard definitions of kink and expands the idea of what it's all about. She maps out a fine-tuned and flexible framework that anyone can use to better describe their appetites.

She calls this her \u201chead-heart-hands\u201d method to create a space where people are allowed individual self-exploration.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

And why, when we think of Flannery O'Connor or William Faulkner or Harper Lee, do we think of them not just as writers, but as\u00a0Southern\u00a0writers? In\u00a0South Toward Home, Margaret Eby - herself a Southerner - travels through the South in search of answers to these questions, visiting the hometowns and stomping grounds of some of our most beloved authors. From Mississippi (William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Richard Wright) to Alabama (Harper Lee, Truman Capote) to Georgia (Flannery O'Connor, Harry Crews) and beyond, Eby looks deeply at the places that these authors lived in and wrote about.\u00a0South Toward Home reveals how these authors took the people and places they knew best and transmuted them into lasting literature.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/d\/d\/600_445544765.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Since our discussion is held at the Nordstrom Market Cafe, I plan on enjoying dinner during our discussion.

Reilly in John Kennedy Toole's\u00a0A Confederacy of Dunces. From the library that showed Richard Wright that there was a way out to the courtroom at the heart of\u00a0To Kill a Mockingbird, Eby grapples with a land fraught with history and mythology, for, as Eudora Welty wrote, \"One place understood helps us understand all places better.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCombining biographical detail with expert criticism, Eby delivers a rich and evocative tribute to the literary South.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe Howard County Public Library has 6 copies of this book.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the back of the Nordstrom Marketplace Cafe.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/columbia-meetup-book-club\/events\/227772790\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"January Book Club Meeting","id":"227772790","time":1453419000000,"updated":1453523511000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1193699468000,"name":"Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":783965,"urlname":"columbia-meetup-book-club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Columbia","address_1":"6600 Cradlerock Way","name":"East Columbia Branch Library","lon":-76.846527,"id":19952112,"lat":39.19109,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.9439964294,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450297318000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We expect to have someone from the Howard County Democratic Committee at 7PM to give us information about becoming a delegate.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We need to plan some more events, so please think about something that you would like or organize (either take the lead or work with someone else) and come in with ideas and dates if you can.\u00a0 You don't have to wait for the meeting; you can go ahead and plan something (contact me if you want me to help advertise it).\u00a0 If we can get some more items on the calendar then people will show up and help.\u00a0 This is a grassroots campaign so if we don't do it then it won't get done.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maryland-Suburbs-for-Bernie-Sanders\/events\/227461454\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":8100000,"name":"Meeting in Columbia","id":"227461454","time":1453419000000,"updated":1453428151000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436652312000,"name":"Maryland Suburbs for Bernie Sanders","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":18734785,"urlname":"Maryland-Suburbs-for-Bernie-Sanders","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"8855 McGaw Road","name":"Wegman's - 2nd floor","lon":-76.819817,"id":18519302,"state":"MD","lat":39.18586,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.9146051407,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1271834305000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>New members come and try us out!

Discussion was lively and we posed the question: How can we bring Hawaii's inclusiveness and unifying positivity to Baltimore and the rest of the nation?<\/p> <p>This session will open earlier than usual (6:15), with a light potluck supper, because we have a lot on the agenda. We open with a long-awaited Zip Code Project presentation by First U members Jaki and Mason Alston, who will lead a discussion about 2 zip codes in which they have lived: 21217 and 21202. Our youth group members are planning to come with fresh ideas and perspectives.<\/p> <p>Afterwards , we will view a special news show that features numerous Baltimore activists, including Tawanda Jones, leader of (Tyrone) West Wednesdays, and JC Faulk, creator of Circles of Voices. There will be a QandA with a panel of several of the featured activists. JC is our current Change for Change partner, and he will be hosting Circles of Voices at First U on Saturday, February 20, 2016, 6-9 pm, in the parish hall.<\/p> <p>Also looking ahead: First U will be hosting an Anti-Racism Jubilee training, coordinated by Paula Cole Jones of All Souls Church and the UUA, on March 4-6, 2016. Please contact me or Paula for details: [masked] Register now to save your spot!<\/p> <p>Finally, we will share ways everyone can participate in our church's current project, <b>\"40 Days of Black Lives Matter,\" which begins on January 15, MLK's birthday, and continues to February 23, the birthday of W.E.B.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

Through experiential exercises, brief lessons and group discussion, participants will learn skills that will help to reduce stress, enhance performance, find more enjoyment in daily life, and deal more effectively with social, academic and family difficulties.<\/p> <p>Mindfulness is a practice of bringing attention to present-moment experiences. By practicing mindfulness, we can begin to find a greater sense of ease in everyday life, even in the face of events that we find stressful or unpleasant.

Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

Every day around the world, cultures celebrate, honor and signify meaningful events with toasts, usually involving a libation, heartfelt words and the clinking of glasses. Whether toasting the Almighty, the head of state, the wedding party or an award recipient, we toast for health, wealth, happiness, safe passage, healing or any of a number of noble and sometimes frivolous aspirations.<\/p> <p>Yet few people know the history behind this ritual. It\u2019s a tradition that began centuries ago. \u201cThe ancient Hebrews, Persians and Egyptians were toasters, as were the Saxons, Huns and other tribes,\u201d Paul Dickson writes in his book Toasts: Over 1,500 of the Best Toasts, Sentiments, Blessings and Graces.<\/p> <p>In his 18th-century history book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons wrote about toasting, Dickson notes. Gibbons described a feast among the Huns at which their leader, Attila, led no less than three rounds of toasts for each course of an elaborate dinner.<\/p> <p>Ancient Greeks drank to each other\u2019s health and welfare. In The Odyssey, Ulysses drank to the health of Achilles. The idea of poison\u2014which was a potent weapon in the sixth century B.C.\u2014also came into play. According to David Fulmer\u2019s book A Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Toasting, toasting was \u201ca good faith gesture to assure the drink wasn\u2019t spiked with poison.\u201d The best way to prove a drink was safe for sipping was to take the first sip. Just as a handshake assured others that nothing was hidden up one\u2019s sleeve, drinking a shared libation in front of others signified to all its worthiness for consumption.<\/p> <p>The Romans built upon this Greek custom of drinking to others\u2019 health and well-being: They added toasted bread crumbs to their goblets, reducing the acidity of the often bitter wine. Thus came the appellation \u201cto toast\u201d\u2014 referring to the drink itself\u2014from the Latin term \u201ctostus,\u201d meaning \u201cto dry up\" or \"scorch.\" In Rome, \"drinking to another\u2019s health became so important, the Senate decreed that all diners must drink to Augustus [the first Roman emperor] at every meal,\u201d Dickson writes. \u201cFabius Maximus [the Roman politician and general] declared that no man should eat or drink before he had prayed for [Maximus] and drank to his health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Clinking of Glasses<br\/>The toasting custom spread throughout Europe and England, where for the first time the clinking of glasses accompanied the ritual. Whether its intent was to mix the content of each other\u2019s glasses so everyone drank the same grog (lessening the likelihood of being poisoned), or to add sound to the experience of taste, touch, smell and sight, no one is sure.<\/p> <p>In the 17th century, toasting became very popular, says Dickson. Eventually, the position of \u201ctoastmaster\u201d emerged. In England, the toastmaster presided over events, delivering and soliciting appropriate toasts. \u201cIn those days the duties of the toastmaster tended to be referee-like in that his main function was to give all toasters a fair chance to make their contribution,\u201d writes Dickson in his book.<\/p> <p>He adds that one of the earliest books on toasting\u2014if not the earliest\u2014was The Royal Toastmaster by J. Roach, published in London in 1791. Roach\u2019s view was that the toast is a very powerful ritual. Consider this passage from his book:<\/p> <p>A Toast or Sentiment very frequently excites good humor, and revives languid conversation; often does it, when properly applied, cool the heat of resentment, and blunt the edge of animosity. A well-applied Toast is acknowledged, universally, to soothe the flame of acrimony, when season and reason oft used their efforts to no purpose.<\/p> <p>To this day, one can find the National Association of Toastmasters in the United Kingdom\u2014whose trained members wear ceremonial red dinner jackets and are skilled at oratory, poetry and toasting. They emcee events of all varieties, from weddings and funerals to christenings and fundraisers.<\/p> <p>Dickson describes a Golden Age of toasting in America during the 40-year period from approximately 1880 to 1920. Many prominent authors wrote toasts, toast books and pamphlets were published, and newspapers ran columns on the subject. One periodical, The National Magazine, had its own Toasts editor, whose duties included judging the best toasts in a monthly contest, Dickson says.<\/p> <p>Traveling Toasts<br\/>Worldwide, numerous nations and cultures have their own toasting customs. Many are similar to each other yet others are unique. For example, in Japan, China and Korea, the customary toasts sound very similar but are pronounced differently. According to the Matador Network (www.matadornetwork.com), a site devoted to travel journalism, toasters in Japan say the word kanpai and pronounce it \u201ckan-pie\u201d; in China they say gan bei and pronounce it \u201cgan bay\u201d; in Korea they say gonbae and pronounce it \u201cgun bae.\u201d<\/p> <p>And Korean toasting customs differ from the Japanese. \u201cIn Korea, the glass is emptied and the last few drops are shaken out, then it is passed to the guest and the host refills the glass,\u201d says the website Etiquette International (www.etiquetteinternational.com). \u201cA glass is never refilled until it is completely empty in Korea, whereas in Japan the glass is constantly refilled so it is never empty.\u201d<\/p> <p>If you\u2019re going to make a toast in another country, notes the site, be sure to find out the toasting customs there \u201cbefore putting your foot in your mouth.\u201d \u201cToasts don\u2019t necessarily translate well, especially if they are idiomatic or poetic,\u201d adds Etiquette International. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to stick to safe topics like friendship, the enjoyment of life and health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The ancient and international tradition of toasting is no doubt one that will endure for many more years. Let\u2019s hope the future of the toast is as engrossing as its past.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.PatuxentToastmasters.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup\/events\/228207620\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters leadership and communication skills meeting.","id":"rvhxjlyvcblc","time":1454027400000,"updated":1454033905000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397935971000,"name":"Toastmasters District 18 Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":13996962,"urlname":"Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Odenton","address_1":"8266 Lokus Rd","name":"Odenton Sports Center","lon":-76.697739,"id":23541089,"state":"MD","lat":39.098236,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.9164428711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452606773000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Odenton-Futsal-Meetup\/events\/228031382\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Hi Futsalers Bring Your Flats and $5","id":"228031382","time":1454029200000,"updated":1454038464000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1419699062000,"name":"Odenton Futsal Meetup","group_lon":-76.6999969482,"id":18276500,"urlname":"Odenton-Futsal-Meetup","group_lat":39.0699996948,"who":"Futsalers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"101 N.

In addition to spoiler-free details pertaining to the types of areas PCs are most likely to encounter on their legendary voyage, this guide will provide campaign traits to f lesh out characters\u2019 backgrounds, advice on races and classes, and rules regarding their relationships with important NPCs and the caravan they\u2019ll be traveling with.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Woodbine-Roleplaying-Group\/events\/228177766\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":12600000,"name":"Jade Regent Campaign Cont'd","id":"228177766","time":1454113800000,"updated":1454128111000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410995826000,"name":"Woodbine Roleplaying Group","group_lon":-77.0699996948,"id":17058752,"urlname":"Woodbine-Roleplaying-Group","group_lat":39.3100013733,"who":"Roleplayers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","city":"Towson 21204","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"Towson American Legion Hall ","lon":-76.604248,"id":12117992,"state":"MD","lat":39.39748,"repinned":false},"headcount":160,"distance":7.48896884918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448991477000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person Cash or Check","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Hawaiian Dance! <\/b>Tired of winter?

If you\u2019ve ever wanted to start meditating, but didn\u2019t know how, this is the class for you! Held once\/month at KMC Maryland, this introduction is designed for beginners so that you can have a personal experience of meditation and inner peace.<\/p> <p>The purpose of meditation is to make our mind calm and peaceful. If our mind is peaceful, we will be free from worries and mental discomfort, and so we will experience true happiness; but if our mind is not peaceful, we will find it very difficult to be happy, even if we are living in the very best conditions. If we train in meditation, our mind will gradually become more and more peaceful, and we will experience a purer and purer form of happiness. Eventually, we will be able to stay happy all the time, even in the most difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>Usually we find it difficult to control our mind. It seems as if our mind is like a balloon in the wind \u2013 blown here and there by external circumstances. If things go well, our mind is happy, but if they go badly, it immediately becomes unhappy. For example, if we get what we want, such as a new possession or a new partner, we become excited and cling to them tightly. We are like a child making a sand castle who is excited when it is first made, but who becomes upset when it is destroyed by the incoming tide. By training in meditation, we create an inner space and clarity that enables us to control our mind regardless of the external circumstances. Gradually we develop mental equilibrium, a balanced mind that is happy all the time, rather than an unbalanced mind that oscillates between the extremes of excitement and despondency.<\/p> <p><b>Walk-ins welcome.\u00a0Cost: $12 \/ $8 for students, seniors 60+, unemployed.
