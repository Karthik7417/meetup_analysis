Guest Editor Krishna Lewis presents a glimpse of cross cultural interaction in these spaces.

The issue features contributions to the Afro-Asian Worlds cluster from M. G. Vassanji, Erin Haney, Jatin Dua, Steven Nelson, Bill V. Mullen, and Lisa Mar\u00eda Burgess. The issue also highlights activism in its various forms, with insights from multiple generations of civil rights leaders in St. Louis, Missouri; startling statistics about the history of solitary confinement in the U.S. prison system; and a portrait of undersung South African poet and activist, Edward Vincent Swart.\u00a0<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Transition Magazine - Born in Africa and bred in the diaspora, Transition is a unique forum for the freshest, most compelling, most curious ideas about race.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/230945891\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"xfbvslyvhbvb","time":1463439600000,"updated":1463451493000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"290 Harvard St","lon":-71.122505,"phone":"617 734-2501","name":"Coolidge Corner Theater","id":726945,"state":"MA","lat":42.342934,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":2.93505835533,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462551485000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>From the Coolidge Website:<\/p> <p>The Triumphant Return of\u00a0Chimes at Midnight!<\/p> <p>The crowning achievement of Orson Welles\u2019s later film career,\u00a0Chimes at Midnight\u00a0returns to the screen after being unavailable for decades. This brilliantly crafted Shakespeare adaptation was the culmination of Welles\u2019s lifelong obsession with the Bard\u2019s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff, the loyal, often soused childhood friend to King Henry IV\u2019s wayward son Prince Hal. Appearing in several plays as a comic supporting figure, Falstaff is here the main event: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with towering, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both\u00a0Henry IV\u00a0plays as well as\u00a0Richard II,\u00a0Henry V, and\u00a0The Merry Wives of Windsor, Welles created an unorthodox Shakespeare film that is also a gritty period piece, which he called \u201ca lament . . . for the death of Merrie England.\u201d Poetic, philosophical, and visceral\u2014with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence as impressive as anything Welles ever directed\u2014Chimes at Midnight\u00a0is as monumental as the figure at its center.<\/p> <p>Jocelyn's additions:<br\/>8.0 rating on IMDb; this is advertised as 'a new restoration'<\/p> <p>TIP: \u00a0buy your ticket in advance and arrive early as there will likely be a line to get in (although I doubt it will sell out, but who knows?) \u00a0<\/p> <p>See you either at Panera, or at the theater. \u00a0We'll try to get in line ~6:30. \u00a0If you think you will arrive later than that, please send me a message and I'll do my best to save a seat for you.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will meet anyone who is at Panera at ~6:15 PM.

If we want to be truly happy and free from suffering, we must learn how to control our mind.\u201d Although we desperately wish to find true, lasting happiness in our life, we still have yet to find it simply because we are looking in the wrong places for it - mainly outside of our self. The only times we are truly happy is when our mind is peaceful and content and the only reliable source of a peaceful and content mind is meditation. No matter how much we search for happiness through arranging the perfect external conditions for our life, if we don\u2019t have a reliable source of inner peace, these things won\u2019t have any power to make us happy. This is great news because we can understand that living a fulfilling, satisfying, life is not a complicated mystery but is actually quite profoundly simple and has been attained by countless people that have made a commitment to cultivating inner peace through meditation.

note: many of the friends who attend regularly are not Meetup members, so there are always more people attending that it says on the Meetup site.)<\/p> <p>About This Meditation Meetup<\/p> <p>We sit in silence for around 45 minutes, followed by discussion for around 30 minutes or so. The silent sitting is interspersed with some meditation instruction, perhaps a brief reading, a little simple inquiry, exploration or movement. Sitting posture is relaxed, either on a meditation cushion or a bench. It's not a rigid practice- move whenever you need to!<\/p> <p>We meet every Monday night, 7:30 pm at the Cambridge Friends Meeting House. The Friends Meeting House is located at 5 Longfellow Park, Cambridge, MA 02138 You can find a very good map here:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcquaker.org\/FMC-Map_2006.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/fmcquaker.org\/about-friends-meeting-at-cambridge\/directions\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Parking is available after 6:00 in the loop off of Brattle St. that leads to the Friend's House, and there is a small lot in back of the Friend's House for those with limited mobility. After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/231030797\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvhbvb","time":1463441400000,"updated":1463523998000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"646 Brookline Ave","name":"Boston Shambhala Center","lon":-71.113411,"id":23059562,"lat":42.332909,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.90739893913,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454275840000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A weekly gathering bringing together Buddhist meditation practice and recovery.

Otherwise, chairs and floor seats are provided. The term mindfulness has become part of our everyday language, we talk about \"eating mindfully\", or \"trying to be more mindful in our consumer choices.\" Furthermore, the actual method of Mindfulness is taught in prisons and schools to reduce stress, it is taught by cognitive therapists to modify dysfunctional patterns of behavior, and it is practiced by corporate CEOs to enhance effectiveness in the workplace. In other words, we have co-opted mindfulness. We have extracted it from its original context and striped it of soteriological meaning. Worse, it has been turned into an elixir to promote the smooth functioning of our most destructive institutions. The word mindfulness comes from the Pali term sati and it is part of the eightfold path which the Buddha prescribed to end Dhaka, the stressful and disturbing mental constructions through which we view ourselves and others. Mindfulness, in this context, is the basis for insight into the true nature of reality, and according to the Buddhist tradition, when we \"wake up\" to the true nature of things, we realize that we are not in as bad shape as we thought. It's likened to waking up from a bad dream. Buddha is said to have become awakened through practicing mindfulness of the breath. In our weekly meetings we will practice basic mindfulness meditation and we will seek to understand how this practice fits within the framework of the Buddha's teachings. Each meeting will last about an hour and consist of brief meditation exercises and some discussion of the Buddha's radical approach to life.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center\/events\/231031333\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"Meditate and discuss the Buddha's teachings","id":"jxtnqlyvhbvb","time":1463443200000,"updated":1463448290000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444180575000,"name":"Building Community @ Common Street Spiritual Center","group_lon":-71.3499984741,"id":19003287,"urlname":"Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Community Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Online","address_1":"Internet","name":"Cyberworld","lon":0,"id":23828508,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462805789000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Note\u00a0Civil\u00a0War between Investors of 1st and 2nd's\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why should you invest in 1st or 2nd's ????<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is so great about each one????<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scott Carson (1st) and \u00a0Fuquan Bilal (2nds)\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now let\u2019s talk about how to maximize your note opportunities efficiently\u2026<\/p> <p>Our goal at NNG is to build a note community by teaching investors how to capitalize on the foreclosure crisis by buying mortgage notes for pennies on the dollar.

We will begin after the signup deadline or after Season 2's Guru Division game ends, whichever happens later.<\/p> <p><i>As a reminder: the ELL is the Food Chain Magnate competition with no strict rules about pace of play. We ask that players check on the status of their game a minimum of once or twice a day. Those who are able to check in a minimum of 3-4 times per day and are looking for a faster pace of play are encouraged to check out the currently open signups for the Electric Drive Thru League.<\/i><\/p> <p>For the uninitiated, the Electric Lunch League is an online competition in the spirit of the EBL et al, devoted to the play of the (very very good) new Splotter Spellen game Food Chain Magnate. No experience with the game is required though it is strongly recommended that you give the rules a decent once-over before diving in. (Also, don't expect to win your first time out; your first game is likely to be a Learning Experience unless you're competing against equally inexperienced players. Fortunately, at this point, nobody has all that much FCM experience!)<\/p> <p>Divisions will be either 3 or 4 players depending on the number of new players, the amount of old-player attrition, and the need to have rational and fair movement between divisions. If you're interested in playing but only if you are placed in a 3-player division (for example) we will try to accommodate you if it can be done fairly but we cannot guarantee you a spot.<\/p> <p>The game length of Food Chain Magnate is variable (by design) but my online games have typically lasted 1 to 2 weeks if people are paying attention.<\/p> <p>Please note that the boardgamecore site DOES NOT send e-mail notifications if it is your turn. If you sign up for the ELL we do ask that you help out your fellow players by checking on the status of your game a minimum of at least once or twice during the day if at all possible.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/230840130\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Electric Lunch League (Online Food Chain Magnate), Season 3","id":"230840130","time":1463500800000,"updated":1463512688000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Andover","address_1":"10 Campanelli dr","name":"Courtyard","lon":-71.198158,"id":24537928,"state":"MA","lat":42.694771,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.082447052,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462863336000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Standard agenda:<\/p> <p>1-min Elevator pitch<\/p> <p>four 15-min slots for presentation\/promotion\/support\/brainstorming.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging.<br\/>2.

It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity.<\/p> <p>There are also some great apps for secure texting and secure phones that provide end-to-end encryption for your calls, securing your conversations so that nobody can listen in.

This enabled the structure to survive Boston\u2019s great fire of 1872, which destroyed 800 structures between Boston Common and the Waterfront.

Because our creative processes overlap and influence one another, knowing each other's considerations is key to designing and implementing experiences that are both usable and performant.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

I have permission for us to do a series of Beginner Salsa Lessons. (swing lessons to follow if this is a success) I'll post 2 to start so please help me make these a success by giving it a shot. You'll have a blast trust me!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our instructors<\/b> have years of dancing experience, plenty of personality and of course I'll be providing the sound system with some great music.

So thank them when you see them at the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our plan is to have weekly dances for 2 hours. The first hour will be a lesson and the 2nd an open dance. These will be geared for beginners so don't be afraid. To You Salsa veterans - please come because we'll need your help too... and you can show off during the open dance hour.<\/p> <p><br\/>Once per month we'll be having a bartender for a 4 hour dance. A little wine might loosen up the hips a little ;-) This first dance will be for 2 hours. The 2nd dance lesson on Feb 26th will have the bar and be open for 4 hours.

Using evidence from neuroscience, developmental psychology, and education, this talk will explore the importance of self-regulation and executive function as core skills to be developed in the preschool period. In particular, we will consider what it means to be \"well regulated,\" how we can measure this abstract construct in real-world settings, and what environmental and biological factors might improve -- or inhibit -- children's odds of achieving self-regulatory success.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio: Dana Charles McCoy is an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her work focuses on understanding the ways that poverty-related risk factors in children's home, school, and neighborhood environments affect the development of their cognitive and socioemotional skills in early childhood. She is also interested in the development, refinement, and evaluation of early intervention programs designed to promote positive development and resilience in young children, particularly in terms of their self-regulation and executive function. Dr. McCoy's work is centered in both domestic and international contexts, including Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Brazil, and Jordan.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We then propose a runtime protocol using first-class implementations to asynchronously control an efficiently implemented computing system from another, \"meta\" system.<\/p> <p>The key of the protocol is then a generalized notion of PCLSRing, that allows to \"decompile\" a concrete program's running state. Many \"advanced\" techniques can then be seen as instances of decompiling and recompiling such running state: garbage collection, process migration, configuration change, process virtualization, etc.<\/p> <p>In particular, virtualization becomes a general purpose user-level primitive in the programming language applicable to arbitrary computing systems, rather than a special purpose system-level primitive in the operating system or runtime platform just for one low-level virtual machine. Various transformations can then be expressed in their natural simplest context while efficiently applied to other programs in a larger context.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p>Far\u00e9 is a cybernetician specialized in software growth<br\/>infrastructure and currently living in NYC.

At Your Heaven\u00ae, he codes software and firmware, develops algorithms, records instruments for acoustic research, tests hardware and designs the exterior of the products. Arvid's goal at Your Heaven\u00ae is to help start the instrument pickup revolution that will make live music on acoustic instruments sound better. His personal work focuses on building electronic performance systems for realtime musical improvisation.<\/p> <p>Steve Schwartz is a musician and audio engineer.

All are welcome to join us, regardless of experience level!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have a game you are particularly interested in playing, you are welcome and encouraged to bring it. But this is not required; many people typically bring a selection of their favorites and we're always happy to teach. The only things you need to bring are an open mind and a good attitude. If you're particularly hot to try something out, you are encouraged to leave a comment and see if you can drum up some interest beforehand. Please bear in mind that table space is limited, so an especially huge or epic game may not be appropriate for the venue (but see our Sunday night event at Pandemonium in Central Square for an alternative venue).<\/p> <p><br\/>The event officially opens at 7 PM, but some people like to show up early; those who show up early should feel free to get started on a shorter warm-up game if time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/>We look forward to seeing you at the gaming table!<\/p> <p><br\/>WHERE WE SIT: Unless the restaurant is super-crowded, we gather in the basement dining area; just look for the games and say hi. We're friendly, honest!<\/p> <p><br\/>GETTING THERE:<\/p> <p><br\/>The Panera is located within easy walking distance of the Red Line T and several bus lines, and public transit is probably the easiest way of getting there. If you drive, mall parking is (theoretically) limited to 2 hours except where posted. I've never heard of anyone getting towed for overstaying this limit. For the extra-cautious, there are metered spots on Mass Ave; check the meter to be sure but most Cambridge meters don't need to be fed after 6 PM or 7 PM. There is also a Hubway bike-share station less than five minute's walk from the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>SOME NOTES:<\/p> <p><br\/>As a group, we don't usually make a huge deal about attendance policy, however: attendance at these events is limited, and our Panera events are usually not huge; one side effect of this is that RSVPing and then not showing up can have a disruptive effect on our events, and for particularly popular events, \"no shows\" take up a spot from someone who wanted to be there. Bottom line: If you RSVP for a Panera event, please make a good-faith effort to show up or at least let us know if you can't make it.<\/p> <p><br\/>As far as possible, please also let us know if you're going to be more than a few minutes late. As a rule of thumb, if we haven't heard from you and you arrive after 7:15 or so, you're likely to be limited to a spot at whatever game has room for an extra player. Much later than that, and we'll almost certainly be underway without you! You're welcome to show up and socialize and of course we'll try to accomodate you if we can, but we can't guarantee you a game. Because we as a group tend to play longer and more involved games, most groups at our events tend to play one and only one game per night.<\/p> <p><br\/>Panera has been quite gracious about hosting our group with minimal fuss. To ensure that this happy state of affairs continues, please give them some business if you're hungry or thirsty and (especially) respect the hardworking people who work there, and their desire to go home after a long shift -- be ready to leave when the restaurant closes at ten.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/230439614\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Wednesday Gaming In Porter Square","id":"rgfbqlyvhbxb","time":1463612400000,"updated":1463624485000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Peabody","address_1":"5 Central Street","name":"The Black Sheep","lon":-70.926903,"id":24448731,"state":"MA","lat":42.527328,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":31,"headcount":0,"distance":13.698800087,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458930641000,"rating":{"count":7,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Speed networking with a TWIST.<\/p> <p>Event \"numero dos\" for us Spark!

Looking for design advice on a map you're working on? Bring that too!<\/p> <p><b>Can you or your organization sponsor this event?<\/b> Please get in touch with the organizers if so! Besides everyone's gratitude, event sponsors will have a few minutes to speak to the group about their company, their work, or anything at all.<\/p> <p>--------<\/p> <p><br\/>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.<\/p> <p><br\/>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent\/collaborative work time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?<\/p> <p><br\/>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in at security with your ID and let them know you're here for Maptime, then head to the 4th floor.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maptime-Boston\/events\/230901936\/","yes_rsvp_count":48,"duration":7200000,"name":"Map Design: Principles and Best Practices of Cartography","id":"230901936","time":1463612400000,"updated":1463621476000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402411414000,"name":"Maptime Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":15000532,"urlname":"Maptime-Boston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"1321 Main St., 2nd Floor","name":"Zoom Zone","lon":-71.061348,"id":23820544,"state":"MA","lat":42.473297,"repinned":false},"headcount":9,"distance":7.85639572144,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462454934000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Have you seen the movie <b>The Secret<\/b> and then wanted to learn more?\u00a0Are you longing to gain a deeper understanding about the Law of Attraction and Abraham?

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

This lets us make the decision as late as possible while still giving those who live farther away time to get here.

These include products that deliver drugs in a unique way, such as artificial pancreas systems, and products that use drugs to enhance the function of a device, such as drug eluting stents.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNorthEast staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNorthEast staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnortheast.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>Tourney's have a new cost structure for 2016.

However, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You\u2019re introducing someone else\u2019s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Each component may have vulnerabilities (~14% of them do), be compromised, or even be outright malicious. Multiply that risk by hundreds of dependencies, and you have a recipe for disaster.<\/p> <p>We will demonstrate how you can mitigate this risk without losing productivity. We will also share data about risk, show how to find and fix known vulnerabilities in these dependencies, discuss how to prioritize the ones worthy of manual inspection, and suggest what to monitor in production.<\/p> <p>Guy Podjarny (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/guypod\">@guypod<\/a>) is a cofounder at Snyk.io focusing on the security risk in your dependencies.

Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness.

This didn\u2019t happen to nice Jewish girls.<\/i><br\/>In 1935, Dottie Krasinsky is the epitome of the modern girl. A bookkeeper in Midtown Manhattan, Dottie steals kisses from her steady beau, meets her girlfriends for drinks, and eyes the latest fashions. Yet at heart, she is a dutiful daughter, living with her Yiddish-speaking parents on the Lower East Side. So when, after a single careless night, she finds herself in a family way by a charismatic but unsuitable man, she is desperate: unwed, unsure, and running out of options.<br\/>After the birth of five children\u2014and twenty years as a housewife\u2014Dottie\u2019s immigrant mother, Rose, is itching to return to the social activism she embraced as a young woman.

Employee treatment, retention and benefits are just a few factors at work in Brian\u2019s \u201cMirror Theory\u201d \u2014 the idea that the way your employees treat your customers is a direct reflection of how your business treats its employees.\u00a0<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:\u00a0<b>Brian Kelly<\/b>, President of The Kelly Automotive Group, was born and raised on the North Shore. He began his business career at age eight with lemonade stands and paper routes, and then buying and refurbishing small boats and motors. At age 13, he was sweeping floors and changing light bulbs at his father\u2019s used-car lot, and by age 16, he was taking customers for test drives. A 1970 graduate of Claude H. Patton Vocational School in Beverly, Brian went on to NADA Executive Training and purchased his father\u2019s Datsun dealership in 1980. That was the start of The Kelly Automotive Group, which now boasts 12 brands at nine locations. This has been a family-owned and operated business through three generations over 50 years.

The City of Denver reported the highest rate of participation with one out of every 28 adults participating in its 2010 Bike to Work event. That effort makes a difference: Many people who participate in their Bike to Work Day promotion as first-time commuters become regular bike commuters.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/d\/5\/600_449622197.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>But Bike Month is more than one day \u2014 or week!

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

In the last few years, she has been volunteering with children with Down syndrome through the Down Syndrome Learning Program, and discovered the world of special needs. Through personal contacts and social media, she learned that while many resources exist for children with disabilities, these largely disappear when the children grow up. For example, people with disabilities face an employment rate of less than 20%. Inspired by stories about establishments such as Tim\u2019s Place in Albuquerque, NM, Galit started wishing that a similar venue would open in the Boston area. As luck would have it, she was invited to participate in a workshop through Landmark Education to \u201ccreate a project in the community which makes a difference and empowers others.\u201d Galit used this opportunity to turn the dream of the Power Cafe into reality. Power Cafe is committed to supporting those with disabilities as much as possible through partnerships with the caf\u00e9. The art on the walls of the cafe comes from Gateway Arts in Brookline, MA, an art studio and gallery for adults with disabilities. Coffee beans for the cafe are sourced from Furnace Hills Coffee in Maryland, a roaster with Down syndrome. Galit and the team at Power Cafe are excited to be a part of the Watertown community. Everyone at the Power Cafe is appreciative of the support of its customers and knows that together we can \u201cempower people of all abilities, one cup of coffee at a time.\u201d Havurah on the Hill is a non-denominational, egalitarian minyan for Jews in their 20s and 30s in the Boston area.

It\u2019s super hard work, but we convince ourselves it\u2019s worth it because it\u2019s the only way to get what we want. But what if that\u2019s not always true? You\u2019ve had those experiences of getting to the long-awaited goal, only to find that it feels empty. All the longing and struggle to get there left you tired and wondering what happened.

They also experientially discover the power of surrender. David Freeman, an OM practitioner since 2014 and graduate of the OneTaste Coaching program, learned first hand the role of surrender in letting his desires flourish beyond his wildest dreams when he decided to create and lead the first OM retreat in Costa Rica. David is a wolf at heart: powerful, clever, and a skilled hunter of that which he desires. He uses his wolf alchemy to help others discover the seeds of their desires, plant them in fertile soil, and then through true surrender, encourage those desires to flourish.<\/p> <p>In this talk, David shares his experiences and learnings, his walk along the path of Orgasmic Meditation, and the impact of his practice on his work and life.<\/p> <p>He will also briefly describe the practice of Orgasmic Meditation, and if you discover desire to go deeper, you can register for the Intro to OM class on Saturday, May 21, 1 - 5 PM, with a special rate when you register at the lecture.<\/p> <p>This is an interactive evening you won\u2019t want to miss!

We provide an inspired performance with the perfect flow of music from the beginning to the end. During our breaks we keep the music going with one of Lisa's custom Ipod playlists so once we start, the music never stops.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0Lisa Love Experience is a TRUE band. Lisa Love and Billy Garzone (along with Gabe Cabral and Otis Rogers) formed the Lisa Love Experience 14 years ago with a mission statement: to play great music and entertain the audience as if it were our lifes purpose ...because it is! It's not just the songs we play, but how we play them, with musical inspiration and love for the crowd. Lisa's amazing ability to connect with the audience and make them part of the experience creates much more than a great show, it creates lasting memories. Our reviews are a testament to that. We perform with musical passion, high energy and a love for what we do and most importantly ...a love for the\u00a0audience.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0During the course of our career we have had some absolutely amazing experiences and opportunies, performing well over 1000 shows all over New England and traveling as far as Hawaii. We have been featured in many popular Boston wedding blogs and Boston wedding magazines (Style Me Pretty, Bliss, I Do ...just to name a few). We have also been featured on the televison show Boston Chronicle and New Hampshire Chronicle for thier wedding specials. As much as we love performing in the most inspiring and funnest venues New England has to offer, what we love most is the people we play for.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/1\/8\/600_449849464.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/231011343\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Friday Nite Luv - Lisa Love - Capones - Peabody, MA","id":"231011343","time":1463790600000,"updated":1463803294000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Marlborough","address_1":"350 East Main Street","name":"Firefly's BBQ","lon":-71.530815,"id":24497722,"state":"MA","lat":42.352791,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":49,"headcount":48,"distance":23.5816688538,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461081650000,"rating":{"count":7,"average":4.86000013351},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's enjoy some great BBQ food and company at this restaurant everyone seems to love.<br\/>Our favorite live band, The Road Dawgs, will be playing.<\/p> <p>We'll meet in the private area over on the left inside Dante's at 9:00 PM. \u00a0Ask for the \"Meetup group\".<\/p> <p>You can order drinks and food all evening as we enjoy the music.

Vander Photography will bring a blanket and find a nice spot for people to sit and relax when they aren't shooting. Otherwise, run around through the gardens, the theater district or Chinatown and shoot your life away.<\/p> <p>The Rules from last year:<br\/>- Besides the rare candids, any photographer(s) and subject(s) need to agree to shooting before it happens.<br\/>- If, for some reason, someone doesn't want to work with you, go find someone else to have fun with! Everyone can have a good time!<br\/>- Bring something for peeps to share. Munchkins for some snacking, fruit for a healthy day, gum to keep breath in order. Even if it's a cheap, bulk item that cost $5, join the community with a small, generous offering. It breaks the ice and everyone automatically loves you. I'll probably bring a few dozen waters and a cooler so people don't dehydrate.<br\/>- No Hate. This is mainly for people who work in similar fields who may not like each other, whether its rival photography companies or on the modeling\/cosplaying circuit.

The Old Manse is a must-see stop on any visit to historic Concord. This National Historic Landmark was built in 1770 by Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s grandfather, the Reverend William Emerson [masked]). This Minister's House subsequently became a focal point of America\u2019s political, literary and social revolutions over the course of the next century. Here, Ralph Waldo Emerson [masked]) and Nathaniel Hawthorne [masked]) would draft some of their most famous works.

There are a couple acts this group has enjoyed from past years that we'll plan to visit, but after that we'll just wander around. This is very casual event. So we begin by crossing Elm St and heading up Hancock St toward Charnwood Rd. Here we'll see the Charnwood Porchpickers (I could listen to them ALL day) and a thereminist named Jon Bernhardt.<\/p> <p>If there is a particular band you wish to see, please bring the address and we'll try to swing by. I'll have my Android handy so we can easily find our way.<\/p> <p>Also, if any of you wish to join but need to meet us later, please private message me and I'll give you my phone number. I can't promise we'll be able to find each other, but we can try. Sometimes the bands are QUITE loud and I won't hear my phone\/text ring. And the group may be on the move and so difficult to find.

I love my little hamsa pin. I love Kabbalah. I love doing healings involving the sacred sound of the Hamsa. The healing is a visualization of the Hamsa, the hand of God, touching your heart and strengthening the aura of protection around you. You're gonna feel it. Trust me!<\/p> <p>This healing is all about resonating with protection and clarity in a world that can throw us a toxic curveball or two. The Hand (hamsa), particularly the open right hand, is a sign of protection that also represents blessings, power and strength, and is seen as potent in deflecting the evil eye. If you worry about losing your energy during the day or being affected by \"negative' people, this healing is for you.<\/p> <p>As for the healing itself, everyone will lie down on comfy mats in a beautiful temple (bring your own blanket) and enter into a state of deep relaxation as I play my tibetan bowls and gongs and drum. As I go to do healing work with each one of you, everyone else benefits from the shifts that occur in more ways than one. I hope you can join me on the 21st ... If you want me to personalize your healing, beforehand call me at[masked]-8601. I make no claims for what I do. I merely facilitate and hold space for the healing and transformation you need to do yourself.

In 1940, seven years after the death of her husband, Charles W. Ward, she paid tribute to his memory and their union by making an original donation of 153 acres to The Trustees. In ensuing years, the Ward family and others have made additional gifts; the reservation now totals 700 acres.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Trails link three major hills \u2013 Shrub, Boston, and Holt \u2013 and looking out from their summits you can see how the property melds with the surrounding landscape. The \u201cSolstice Stones\u201d mark the grassy summit of Holt Hill, the highest point in Essex County. This compass-like arrangement of stones indicates the cardinal points on the compass, the points of the summer and winter solstices, and the points of the spring and autumnal equinoxes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>At the base of Holt Hill, step onto a boardwalk that leads to Pine Hole Pond, at which point you may ask: Is this water or land? In fact, you are walking across a rare quaking bog, comprised of concentric rings of floating vegetation, each with unique growing conditions. The bog is home to a number of interesting plant species, including orchids and insect-eating pitcher plants. Stop at the numbered stations along the way, each of which signals an interesting botanical or geologic feature. Pick up an interpretive booklet at the bulletin board to follow numbered stations along the boardwalk and learn more about this rare natural phenomenon.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Trails<br\/>Almost 10 miles of trails, easy-to-moderate hiking, strenuous in places. Some of the trails here are part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.baycircuit.org\/\">Bay Circuit Trail<\/a>, a regional greenway linking the North Shore and South Shore.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When to Visit<br\/>Year-round, daily, 8am to sunset.

Until early 2014, he was a state representative in the Massachusetts Legislature. There, he was the leading legislative advocate on HIV-related legislation. These include measures to increase funding for HIV-related services; a bill that would require health insurers to cover the costs of treatment of lipodistrophy; and a law that expands HIV testing in Massachusetts. Sciortino, who is living with HIV, has championed social justice issues throughout his career, including the right of same-sex couples to marry; banning discrimination against transgender people; expanding access to health care; and increasing resources for anti-poverty programs.

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening.

I feel really flattered and grateful for such enthused participation. Keeps me motivated and inspired to host more feasts and swaps. Thank you!<\/p> <p>Ok, so now let's get into the yummy stuff. First we swapped cookies (December). Then it was soups (January) and vegetarian chili (February). After that was sauces (March). Since there are two feasts in April, our next swap will be in May, and it will be all about <b>chocolate<\/b>!<\/p> <p><br\/>You can pick any recipe you want. Savory or sweet, I don't care. Solid or liquid form, it's your choice. As long as your recipe includes chocolate (or cacao), it automatically qualifies for this month's food swap. Be sure to find a recipe that can easily be packaged into individual portions (see sizing below), and that will travel well.<\/p> <p><br\/>Whatever inspires you . . . make it, bring it, and swap it!<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>HERE'S THE SCOOP . . .<\/b><\/p> <p>1. <b>Pick a Recipe :: <\/b>Whether it's a family favorite, or one you've ripped out of a magazine\u00a0 . . . this event is the perfect opportunity for your culinary ideas to shine. <b>NOTE :: <\/b>Once you know what you want to make, please <b>post it<\/b> in the comments section. This will help avoid duplication and inspire a better variety of recipes.<\/p> <p>2.<b> Storage <\/b>:: Glass jars, plastic containers, ziplock baggies, boxes, etc . . . Considering what recipe you choose, design your packaging to be portable and swap friendly. For example, if you decide to make Puppy Chow, avoid bringing it in a big bowl. Instead, divvy it up into baggies and carry them with you to the event. Easier to transport and pass out. Make sense?<\/p> <p>3.<b> Serving Size <\/b>:: Aim for 12\u201316 ounces for each portion (comparable to a jar of jelly). If it's cookies, plan for packages of 6 cookies. For smaller treats, truffles, turtles, etc... I'd suggest 8 pieces per package. Not everyone's items will be the exact same size or weight, but as along as they're close enough, everyone will be happy. <b>NOTE :: Please take a moment to label the containers with the recipe name and packaging date.<\/b><\/p> <p>4.<b> How Much to Bring?<\/b> :: Now that we're all on the same page with the serving size, let's discuss how much to bring. Each person is asked to bring a MINIMUM of 8 portions \u2014 <b>7 for swapping + 1 for sampling <\/b>(the sample doesn't have to be entirely full, just enough for everyone to have a taste). You are welcome to bring more than 8 servings. If you're feeling ambitious\u2014I say go for it! Essentially, whatever amount you bring for swapping, that's the amount of you'll be bringing home. For example, if you bring 10 containers for swapping, you'll leave with 10 different chocolaty foods! <b>NOTE :: <\/b>Even though 15-20 of us will be coming together for this event, you do NOT have to bring 15-20 servings.<\/p> <p>Feeling motivated? If you have the time and can't pick just ONE sauce recipe, feel free to bring TWO recipes for swapping (a minimum of 16 containers you'd be bringing \u2014 totally ambitious, yet awesome).<\/p> <p><br\/>5.<b> Sampling the Food.<\/b> Have a plate or a bowl with you, so you can put out your food for sampling. I'll have some on hand, along with utensils, just in case. <b>NOTE :: Please bring a list of all the ingredients in your recipe<\/b> (or copies of your recipe works, too)<b>. <\/b>This will be super helpful for everyone involved.<\/p> <p>6. <b>How the Swapping Works :: <\/b>Though there will be a great variety of recipes for this event, you will NOT be bringing all of them. If you brought 7 containers for swapping, you will be choosing 7 different foods to take home. During the \"tasting\" portion of the event, you will be making note of which ones you'd like to potentially swap. <b>NOTE :: <\/b>There's no guarantee you're going to get the exact foods you want. It's up to the other person to decide if they want to take YOUR food home, too. I know, it sounds confusing. I'll explain everything at the event.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Most clips flounder in a sad limbo of indifference and anonymity\u2014unless your YouTube handle happens to be Princess Shaw. By day, Samantha Montgomery cares for the elderly in one of New Orleans's toughest neighborhoods. By night, she writes and sings her own songs as Princess Shaw, belting out soulful originals and posting a cappella clips on YouTube, usually reaching just a handful of viewers. Raw and vulnerable, her voice is a diamond in the rough. Across the globe, Ophir Kutiel, better known as Kutiman, is an Israeli musician living on a kibbutz outside Tel Aviv who mashes up YouTube videos from all over the world to create new musical pieces. Princess Shaw has no idea that he has found hers. Two strangers, almost 7,000 miles apart, begin to build a song. The film unfolds as Kutiman pairs Princess Shaw's emotional performances in a beautiful expression of generosity and compassion, revealing the bona fide star underneath and her fight to never give up on her dreams.<\/p> <p>PRESENTING PRINCESS SHAW opens Friday, June 3 at Landmark's Kendall Square Cinema.
