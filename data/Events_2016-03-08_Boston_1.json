Christine believes that within each of us lie tremendous untapped reservoirs of potential. Discovering the strategies and power of positive change and, conversely, releasing what holds us back, has been the defining journey of her life and work.<\/p> <p>Today, drawing on Christine's 20 + years of mentoring business executives, parents, and leaders from around the world, along with her research in positive psychology, she guides people to unleash the best within\u2014no matter where they stand currently. Learn about what Christine calls, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/2011\/02\/bright-student-bottom-myths-of-education\/\">The Gifts that Conflict with School<\/a> (and are well-suited to leadership and success).<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/b\/f\/600_446126815.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>She has mentored, facilitated, spoken and led positive change with thousands of individuals and groups worldwide, including Fortune 50 executives, individuals, families, and communities. Author of \"What I'd Say if You Wouldn't Roll Your Eyes... love notes to my child,\" Christine mentors and facilitates other professionals-- including leaders, physicians, coaches, teachers and counselors-- using positive approaches to get the results they want, sooner, and bringing out the full potential in themselves and others.<\/p> <p>Clients say, \"Christine helped me become the leader I am... get promoted.... turn problem staff to top performers... engage my team.... get people on board with new strategy and culture.... transform my relationships... turn around a demoralized organization... see the best in me....feel energized.\"<\/p> <p>She has personally experienced the power of positive change in her life and work, beginning her study and application at age 17. As a mid-level employee in a 135,000- person company, she discovered how to have much greater impact, in much less time, as she followed her own vision, which was contrary to everything around her. As a result, Christine led a team that convinced the executive committee to adopt a radical new goal, went on to engage employees worldwide in a change that boosted customer loyalty 20%, and was promoted to Worldwide Director of Customer Quality and Loyalty.<\/p> <p>While studying and working with Martin Seligman, David Cooperrider, George Vaillant and other founders in the science of positive psychology &amp; well-being, she experienced the power of positive change when tragedy struck and she was catapulted into her own post-traumatic growth and resilience. Her groundbreaking research at UPenn identified paths to unleash hidden gifts and lead each of us to thrive in life.<\/p> <p>Watch a video interview with Christine, read one of Christine's studies or listen to an audio interview and learn more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\">www.christineduvivier.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/register-have-more-impact-in-less-time-webinar\/\">Register Here for the link to join us.<\/a><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Register Here for the link: http:\/\/www.christineduvivier.com\/register-have-more-impact-in-less-time-webinar\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Science-of-Happiness-Boston\/events\/228833725\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Christine Duvivier: Have More Impact in Less Time","id":"228833725","time":1455751800000,"updated":1455756823000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429219600000,"name":"The Science of Happiness: Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18550910,"urlname":"The-Science-of-Happiness-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Flourishers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02062","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Norwood","address_1":"55 Providence Hwy","name":"Baystate Archery","lon":-71.184433,"id":15887312,"state":"MA","lat":42.209717,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":11.9421720505,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1399510303000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meetup for practice and introduction to archery!

Fear stops us from being at our best. To feel better, we try to soothe ourselves through a variety of means. Some are relatively harmless such as watching hours of mindless TV, scrolling through Facebook, and escaping through our work. Others may be more harmful such as self medicating through alcohol or drugs. However, every behavior pattern we find ourselves in--even seemingly unrelated ones like overspending, needy relationships and gambling--can often be traced back to anxiety. The bottom line is that we innocently get caught up in destructive patterns because they temporarily make us feel better. While we're in the midst of them, we are able to ignore, or simply don't notice the anxious stream of thoughts constantly floating through our minds.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, while we may have unconsciously set out to escape scary thoughts, after a while, life can start to spiral out of control. Until one day we wake up and barely recognize the person we've become. We're paralyzed with inaction and the behaviors that made us feel better, now make us feel worse. This creates even more anxiousness. Now we have to worry about really big stuff such as our failing health, our finances and\/or relationships.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>What if there was a way of seeing life differently so that we didn't need our old soothing behaviors?<br\/>What if there was a simple, yet profound understanding of how life truly works that could ease our minds? What if just by having this understanding at a deep level, our anxiety would start to evaporate on its own? While this sounds pretty lofty, there is such an understanding. One in which there's nothing to do but have an \"Aha Moment.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>If it's true--(and it is)--we're home free.<br\/>Join us for a no cost, no strings, no nonsense talk on where your anxiety comes from and how it can be eliminated.<\/p> <p>This meeting will be lead by Jill Whalen, the Meet Up organizer.<\/p> <p>More About Jill:<\/p> <p>For over 18 years Jill was a highly successful web marketing consultant. After a 6 month period of losing weight and getting fit and healthy, she woke up one day to the voice of wisdom inside her telling her it was time for a change. She immediately closed up shop and spent the next few years learning everything she could about personal transformation, health and wellness and the mind-body-spirit connection. At some point in her journey Jill became aware of just how much anxiety was constantly floating around in the background of her mind. While she had various coping strategies such as drinking unhealthy amounts of alcohol and avoiding the things she feared, something inside her told her there had to be a better way. When she stumbled upon a new understanding of how life really works and what her anxiety was actually comprised of, her reality looked completely different. Though she still gets anxious at times, her knowledge has almost miraculously made it unnecessary for her seek anything outside of herself to feel better. As a professional conference speaker, trainer and writer, Jill is on a quest to share her knowledge and experience of personal and business transformation in small groups, on a one-to-one basis and via her blog: \"What Did You Do With Jill?\"<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Ashland, MA","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Innate-Well-Being\/events\/228643151\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Freedom From Fear and Anxiety","id":"228643151","time":1455753600000,"updated":1455802431000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432323307000,"name":"Uncover Our Innate Mental Health & Well Being in New England","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":18617865,"urlname":"Innate-Well-Being","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"145 Ipswich St","lon":-71.094019,"phone":"617-437-0300 ","name":"Jillians","id":790541,"state":"MA","lat":42.347467,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.50450861454,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445813367000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get the most out of this Winter with a fun season of S3 Bowling!\u00a0This league is all about meeting new people so don't worry at all if you're a rookie!\u00a0S3 leagues place\u00a0competition on the backburner and encourages a relaxed, social atmosphere.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

heat for about 60 seconds until the chips develop a slight sheen.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Place all ingredients in a medium pot (or add to the double-boiler) and over medium heat, and stir constantly for about 5 minutes taking care not to burn the chocolate.\u00a0<br\/>Form small balls and place on a non-stick cookie sheet.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Refrigerate for at least 60 minutes before serving.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>For those wanting to reduce fat intake, this can be made without the coconut oil, but make sure the chocolate chips are completely melted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><a

George brings over 25 years of successful executive experience creating and growing mobile, enterprise, and security software businesses. As CEO of startup ViziApps, he has created strategic partnerships with such companies as Salesforce, Intuit and AT&amp;T. Before co-founding ViziApps, he was CEO of SSH Communications Security Inc. (recently renamed Tectia Inc.), building it from a startup to an industry leader and $400M IPO. Before that, he was VP of Marketing, Products, and Business Development, for Phoenix Technologies Ltd., helping create and expand the PC, laptop, and mobile device industries. Earlier, he launched and built key new industry-leading businesses at Sun Microsystems, Intel, Analog Devices, and Motorola.

These events require an event ticket which cost $1.50 for each two hour block. A game like Arkham Horror might take up two blocks and you would need two $1.50 tickets. Before I started teaching games at Totalcon, I used to get the all day pass for $7.50, which allows you to play in any scheduled events. There are also many tournament games and regional qualifiers. There are crazy amounts of role playing games scheduled and available.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Perhaps we have a database ID appearing in our API. Or there is a service method that contains-commit \u00adstrategy logic that we wish was managed by our ORM. The text-\u00adbook toolset of the past hasn\u2019t helped. Entity-\u00adrelationship domain modeling, relational databases, old-\u00adfashioned OO programming languages, and a database driver or an ORM, all fight against us as we try to write maintainable code.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, today, we have a much richer toolset: Domain Driven Design, NoSQL databases, and F\/OO programming languages. But when doing Scala and NoSQL, we end up resorting to database drivers. While very good at what they do, drivers provide a low\u00ad-level API that leaves the heavy\u00adlifting of persistence to us.<\/p> <p>Longevity is a persistence framework that takes advantage of all these new technologies \u00ad DDD, NoSQL, and Scala \u00ad to provide a fluent and clear API that encapsulates persistence concerns, removing them entirely from your domain model and service classes.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss some of the core concepts of Domain Driven Design, and how they can be used to elegantly manage your persistence concerns. We\u2019ll then look at how to apply these principles in your application using the longevity API.<\/p> <p>Speaker bio:<br\/>John Sullivan is an 18-\u00adyear Java veteran who has been happily programming in Scala for over 5 years.

The tunes we play can be found here (<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/4740542\/Thursday%20Practice%20Session%20Tunes%20%2805-14%29.pdf\">Sheet Music<\/a>). Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.<\/p> <p><b>By Bus<\/b><\/p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square. \u00a0The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center.\u00a0The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway.\u00a0The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square.\u00a0From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.\u00a0The 77 bus runs between Harvard and Arlington Heights. You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.<\/p> <p><b>By Car<\/b><\/p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts. Take the first left turn from Curtis onto Raymond Street. Ignore the NO LEFT TURN sign, as it is only in effect during rush hours. Raymond runs behind the school. The lot is about half a block down Raymond on the left.<\/p> <p>Street parking is also available one block away on Packard Avenue from Powderhouse Blvd on the hill to the Tufts University campus.

We are shifting from creating value and defining products using electronics to creating solutions using software. Consider the smartphone: is it a telephone, or is it a gaming unit, a calendar a camera or a television? With other form factors we can mix or match parts to create a desktop computer, a television, a home control system or whatever we can imagine. Many single-use devices and classic limitations no longer exist. The Internet is central to this revolution. It is a byproduct of creating connectivity solutions using any available means. The Internet represents a fundamental change in how we build systems and in what it means to communicate. You simply click on a URL and you're \"there\". You don't worry about wires or reserved frequency. You can just assume that the packets will appear at the destination most of the time. Using software defined relationships as building blocks is very different from traditional hardware-based engineering. Welcome to the new world of software and the Internet. There's no dependence on providers or networks. For the IEEE these changes present an opportunity and challenge. Devices are becoming connected, opening up new frontiers as we create and share our own solutions and become less dependent on service providers. We're at the very earliest stages of an exciting new world.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/8\/8\/600_446541896.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bob Frankston is a Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and the Computer History Museum.

Fikry<\/i>, by Gabrielle Zevin<\/b>! Here's a description:<\/p> <p><br\/>\"In this sweet, uplifting homage to bookstores, Zevin perfectly captures the joy of connecting people and books. A. J. Fikry, the cantankerous owner of Island Books, is despondent after losing his beloved wife and witnessing the ever-declining number of sales at his small, quirky bookstore. In short order, he loses all patience with the new Knightly Press sales rep, his prized rare edition of Tamerlane is stolen, and someone leaves a baby at his store. That baby immediately steals A. J.\u2019s heart and unleashes a dramatic transformation. Suddenly, the picture-book section is overflowing with new titles, and the bookstore becomes home to a burgeoning number of book clubs. With business on the uptick and love in his heart, A. J. finds himself becoming an essential new part of his longtime community, going so far as to woo the aforementioned sales rep (who loves drinking Queequeg cocktails at the Pequod Restaurant). Filled with interesting characters, a deep knowledge of bookselling, wonderful critiques of classic titles, and very funny depictions of book clubs and author events, this will prove irresistible to book lovers everywhere.\" --Joanne Wilkinson<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see you there--it sounds like a great book club book!<\/p> <p>Diane<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Easy access by T, near the Orange and Green Line stops at Back Bay, Arlington, and Copley","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Sh-t-I-forgot-to-read-the-Book-Club\/events\/228075877\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"\"The Storied Life of A.

Among these events are Observatory Nights held on the third Thursday of the month (excluding June, July and August). Observatory Nights feature a nontechnical lecture and telescopic observing from the observatory roof if weather permits.

No reservations are necessary, but seating is limited to the auditorium's capacity.

Comedians go at each other one at a time, for three rounds with guest judges deciding who is the victor. It's been packing The Belly Room in LA on a weekly basis since 2013 and for the last few months at New York Comedy Club. After a successful debut in November at The Boston Comedy Festival and a jammed show in January, Roast Battle Returns once again to Davis Square for a truly unique one night only spectacle.<\/p> <p>\"You win Roast Battle by preparing. The comedians have worked as much as two weeks on it, getting to know your opponent, researching them, sizing them up. Roasting is writing. Usually the best writers win Roast Battle. It's kind of like boxing -- if you train hard, you win. Roast Battle is like Fight Club for comedians, it's like Bloodsport. If you like your comedy raw and uncensored, Roast Battle is for you.\"<br\/>-Jeff Ross, author of \"I Only Roast the Ones I Love: How to Bust Balls Without Burning Bridges.\"<\/p> <p>\"Roast Battle is comedy at it's most immediate -- a fight-night for comics where the only real rule is to be ruthless.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

I've been working on this for a few months... 2 Hanson Rec Commission meetings later, increasing my liability insurance, signing my life away in a contract, approval from the town administrator and what seems to be 50 trips to this place. I have permission for us to do a series of Beginner Salsa Lessons. (swing lessons to follow if this is a success) I'll post 2 to start so please help me make these a success by giving it a shot. You'll have a blast trust me!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our instructors<\/b> have years of dancing experience, plenty of personality and of course I'll be providing the sound system with some great music. I've taken group lessons before and the music was too fast, esp in the open dance time. So we're going to gear this to 2 left footed neanderthal dancers like me.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Hanson Rec Commission members are very excited about this and want us to succeed. So thank them when you see them at the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our plan is to have weekly dances for 2 hours. The first hour will be a lesson and the 2nd an open dance. These will be geared for beginners so don't be afraid. To You Salsa veterans - please come because we'll need your help too... and you can show off during the open dance hour.<\/p> <p><br\/>Once per month we'll be having a bartender for a 4 hour dance. A little wine might loosen up the hips a little ;-) This first dance will be for 2 hours. The 2nd dance lesson on Feb 26th will have the bar and be open for 4 hours. (7-11 see the post for the 26th)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Gender equity<\/b>? of course ladies bring a man with you but for the first few lessons gender equity won't be a huge issue. Nevertheless, put the pressure on the men you know, in the group and out, to make it to this. It's gonna be a blast !<\/p> <p>Please post questions below.<\/p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS - <\/b>Please use your GPS. For those of you who have never been, Hanson is only 30 min from Plymouth and Braintree.

Lisa has kept it steady on productions all over the country, and looks forward to the new challenges that come with every project.

She holds a BA in Cinematography from Emerson College, and has a strong background in theatrical lighting, both of which contribute to her understanding of visual storytelling.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/7\/9\/600_446336697.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The workshop will run from 9:00AM to 3:00PM and a light lunch will be provided.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please also RSVP to Talamas directly: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.talamas.com\/events\/dont-move-camera-move-story\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.talamas.com\/events\/dont-move-camera-move-story\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.talamas.com\/events\/dont-move-camera-move-story<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>We hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><br\/>ALSO stay tuned for Talamas's second workshop on Audio for Film and Video with Sennheiser's Dave Missall,\u00a0March 24th 7:00 - 9:00PM.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"149 California Street","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-hsswriters-com\/events\/228455955\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":21600000,"name":"Don't Move the Camera, Move the Story!","id":"228455955","time":1455976800000,"updated":1456171333000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1440697257000,"name":"Harvard Square Script Writers","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":18874140,"urlname":"www-hsswriters-com","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"HSSWers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newton","address_1":"149 California St.","name":"Talamas","lon":-71.193901,"id":24334781,"state":"MA","lat":42.365204,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":65,"headcount":0,"distance":6.34890460968,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454191598000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Meetup is now FULL!

With 9,090,261 volumes The Boston Public library is the second largest library in the USA followed by The Harvard academic Library (not public) with 16,832,952 volumes. Both in the state of Massachusetts.<\/p> <p><br\/>Tha Architect<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The McKim Building<\/b> (built 1895) in Copley contains the library's research collection, exhibition rooms and administrative offices. When it opened in 1895, the new Boston Public Library was proclaimed a \"palace for the people.\" The building includes lavish decorations, a children's room (the first in the nation), and a central courtyard surrounded by an arcaded gallery in the manner of a Renaissance\u00a0 cloister The library regularly displays its rare works, often in exhibits that will combine works on paper, rare books, and works of art. Several galleries in the third floor of the McKim building are maintained for exhibits.<\/p> <p><br\/>The History<\/p> <p><br\/>In the mid-19th century, several people were instrumental in the establishment of the Boston Public Library. George Ticknor, a Harvard professor and trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, raised the possibility of establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not generate enough interest.<\/p> <p>In 1839, Alexandre Vattemare, a Frenchman, suggested that all of Boston's libraries combine themselves into one institution for the benefit of the public The idea was presented to many Boston libraries, however, most were uninterested in the idea. At Vattemare's urging, Paris sent gifts of books in 1843 and 1847 to assist in establishing a unified public library. Vattemare made yet another gift of books in 1849.<br\/>Josiah Quincy, Jr. anonymously donated $5,000 to begin the funding of a new library. Quincy made the donation while he was mayor of Boston. Indirectly, John Jacob Astor also influenced the establishment of a public library in Boston. At the time of his death, Astor bequeathed $400,000 to New York to establish a public library there. Because of the cultural and economic rivalry between Boston and New York, this bequest prompted more discussion of establishing a public library in Boston. In 1848, a statute of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts enabled the creation of the library. The library was officially established in Boston by a city ordinance in 1852. Mayor Benjamin Seaver recommended to the city council that a librarian be appointed. In May 1852 the city council adopted the recommendations of the mayor and Edward Capen was chosen to become Boston Public Library first librarian.<\/p> <p>Eager to support the library, Edward Everett collected documents from both houses of Congress, bound them at his own expense, and offered this collection to help establish the new library. At the time of Everett's donation, George Ticknor became involved in the active planning for the new library. In 1852, financier Joshua Bates gave a gift of $50,000 to establish a library in Boston. After Bates' gift was received, Ticknor made lists of what books to purchase. He traveled extensively to purchase books for the library, visit other libraries, and set up book agencies.<\/p> <p>To house the collection, a former schoolhouse located on Mason Street was selected as the library's first home. On March 20, 1854, the Reading Room of the Boston Public Library officially opened to the public.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/a\/9\/600_433337833.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/a\/6\/600_433337830.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/a\/0\/600_433337824.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/e\/e\/600_433337390.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/e\/c\/600_433337388.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet in the lobby at the entrance at Dartmouth St. at 12:45pm","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Urban-Sketchers-Boston\/events\/228948321\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":8100000,"name":"Let's Sketch the Boston Public Library!","id":"228948321","time":1455990300000,"updated":1456000213000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390851834000,"name":"Urban Sketchers Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":12513512,"urlname":"Urban-Sketchers-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Urban Sketchers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":8.72402763367,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406138353000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's draft conspiracy!

Arrayed in a mismatched panoply of rags, Miss Shepherd is hygienically challenged, violently allergic to classical music, maddeningly stubborn and guided by messages direct from the Virgin Mary. What begins as a begrudged favor by Bennett grows into a relationship that will change both their lives. This \u201cmostly true\u201d story, based on the memoir and play by Bennett (The History Boys, The Madness of King George, Prick Up Your Ears), was filmed on the actual street and in the house where it happened; it is directed by Nicholas Hytner, working with Bennett for the third time.

It is a way of communicating with your inner or spirit self and retrieving information. Your inner self is in constant communication with all aspects of your environment, seen and unseen. You need only journey within to find answers to your questions. Be prepared, however, for whatever insights you may receive, whether you like them or not.<br\/>The spirit healing journey is not always what people expect, and sometimes there is uncertainty as to what one should experience in altered states. The ecstatic trance is an individual journey into non-ordinary reality; therefore, experiences vary from person to person and from journey to journey. Once you enter a trance state, the rhythm or sound of the drum tends to change. The drumbeat may appear to speed up or slow down, while the sound may grow louder, softer, or disappear. You may experience a change in body temperature, feel energy flowing through your body, or find yourself twitching, swaying, or rocking. It is not uncommon to hear sounds or voices. You may even smell specific aromas. You may see colorful patterns, symbolic images, or dreamlike visions. Some people may find that they have a highly developed inner vision while others may rely more on instinct, intuition, or intent.<br\/>During the spirit healing journey, one's awareness transcends ordinary reality. In journeys to the Lower World, one may experience the sensation of falling, sliding, or spiraling downward into or under the Earth. In Upper World journeys, one may experience the sensation of rising, floating, flying, or spiraling upward through the air or sky. Journeys to the Lower World involve the movement of awareness to a level beneath ordinary reality and Celestial journeys involve movement to a level above ordinary reality. Lower levels are denser, lower in frequency, and more involved with the physical body, the earthly plane, and material reality. Higher levels are higher in frequency, less dense, and subtler.<br\/>You will experience at least two spiritual journeys. You do not need prior journeying experiences but an openness of the process and possibilities. Elaine is a training and practicing Shaman and will safely lead you on your journey. Please bring a yoga mat, blanket, something to cover your eyes (scarf), and journal as you may wish to write your experiences immediately following the journey. $10 Any questions or to register please contact Elaine [masked] or[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/228128081\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"An Evening of Shamanic Spiritual Healing","id":"qdwwpgyvdbbc","time":1456011000000,"updated":1456026214000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02199","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"BOSTON","address_1":"800 Boylston Street","lon":-71.082584,"phone":"              (617) 536-1775    ","name":"TOP OF THE HUB","id":1148127,"state":"MA","lat":42.347793,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":1.06249856949,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454816816000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This sentiment captures the essence of Top of the Hub\u2019s jazz lounge.

Either a photo with which you have real problems, one where you don't know what to do with or one that you think is good, but needs an extra kick. Problems with white balance, a photo with mixed colors, issues with composition or camera settings, no idea how to convert to B&amp;W, how to bring out the stars in the sky or correct for keystoning? Trying to throw me off and see me fail? We will tackle it.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/9\/e\/600_446447518.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This will be a live demo and discussion, not a lecture, and I will show you what I would do with your images or how I would process them differently, but will also take your suggestions on what to try out. Most importantly, while I'm doing this, I will explain Lightroom's development module to you. I will *not* be talking about the other modules. Also note that you don't need to use Lightroom, you can still learn from the improvement steps or try to recreate them in Adobe Camera Raw, which is very similar to Lightroom.<\/p> <p>Here is what you need to do and if nobody follows this, we won't have anything to do. I need every participant to submit to me no more than three images, but you NEED to send me your original raw data file (.NEF, .CRW, .ORF etc). Alternatively, you can send me a .DNG file (Adobe's raw format) or a .PS Photoshop file (leave the original as an untouched layer!). I will NOT accept or demonstrate JPG files, the editing latitude is not enough to make substantial improvements. Your files will remain confidential and I will delete them after the workshop is done. I encourage you to embed your copyright information!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>See comments for how to submit images.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>If you want us to see what you have tried or if you want to compare before and after, select the photo in LR, then choose from the menu PHOTO - SAVE METADATA TO FILE and send me the sidecar file, the .xmp file with the same name in the same location as your raw file. That xmp file contains all the edits that you made to it. We can save those and then change to what I would do, afterwards compare your and my versions. So, if you have a Nikon raw file named _JML7470.NEF, you also need to send me the _JML7470.xmp file.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in<\/p> <p>- using Lightroom to edit<\/p> <p>- how to use the LR development module<\/p> <p>- how to improve your photos (with or without Lightroom)<\/p> <p><br\/>- how to tackle complex white balance or other issues<\/p> <p>- how to see J\u00fcrgen sweat<\/p> <p><br\/>then this workshop is for you. If you have no interest, whatsoever, in learning about Lightroom, editing or improving photos, or if you can teach this workshop without breaking a sweat, by all means, come to chime in, anyway. :-)<\/p> <p>Your files NEED to be named in the following manner, please do not submit unnamed files!<\/p> <p>LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-YOURNUMBER.ext<\/p> <p>for example<\/p> <p>Lobert-Jurgen-_JML7392.NEF\u00a0 and Lobert-Jurgen-_JML7392.xmp<\/p> <p>I need your files no later than Friday evening, 19-February, 10 pm, files submitted after that may not get considered. Depending on the number of participants, we may not get to edit all of your photos but I will try to edit at least one of them.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/228514980\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":9000000,"name":"Workshop: Editing night photos in Lightroom and Camera Raw","id":"228514980","time":1456013700000,"updated":1456113023000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Mount Auburn Street","name":"The Democracy Center","lon":-71.116333,"id":7789322,"state":"MA","lat":42.371162,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.49305963516,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455040572000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Need a Laugh?

I will give a full hour workshop on camera settings, composition,\u00a0and\u00a0creative subject selection before we go out into the crowd. We will discuss lighting, color balance, and shutter speeds, but don't worry if you are a beginner, I will help you get set.<\/p> <p>Then from 10-11 we will shoot behind the scenes to catch the pre event set up action. Often you can capture the most interesting shots while\u00a0people\u00a0are getting into costumes, putting on makeup and getting organized. I find this is a key to the success of photographing an event. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally at 11am the parade will get underway and you will be ready to capture the scene. This is a vibrant, colorful\u00a0dynamic event that plays out on the streets of Chinatown. We will be right in the middle of the fun so you won't miss a thing.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/2\/b\/600_447007979.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This special workshop on street photography at special events will introduce you to a step by step method for gaining confidence in photographing people in action. \u00a0This is a essential skill for travel photographers, family photographers, and anyone interested in capturing \u00a0moments of life in a way that tells a story.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I hope you can join us. The tuition for the class is $45.00 and includes all instructions and handouts so you can practice the skills again next time you are at an event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am limiting the group size to 10 so please RSVP right away. More details will be provided once I have the full class participation list.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will officially end the class at noon but the event continues all afternoon so you can keep shooting and practicing what you learn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>closest T stop is Chinatown on the Orange line.

The state has designated the area as an important grassland and a natural habitat for plants and animals that have been forced from former farmland. Rock Meadow offers hiking, birding, biking, picnicking and wandering opportunities. The area is also the home of Belmont's community gardens. It resembles the meadows in the south of England. It is the home of Belmont's community gardens (Victory Gardens). Originally owned by McLean Hospital in 1895, a farm was created to provide food during WWII.<\/p> <p>This is a picture of the sign for the Rock Meadow parking lot.

How do we create a society and community where it is okay to feel awful about life sometimes, and where despairing feelings don't need to lead to desperate outcomes-- and where, in fact, being honest with ourselves and others about the hardest aspects of life can actually allow us to experience more joy and connection?<\/p> <p><br\/>Inspired in part by a beautiful book called Stay: a History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It, by Jennifer Michael Hecht (one of Greg's favorite authors in general), this talk will aim to give us a chance to accept some of our darkest places, in order to show how we often have incredible gifts to offer to ourselves and the world around us, in spite of or even because of that with which we struggle.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you've ever personally struggled with feelings of despair and wanted to understand them better, or if you've ever had a friend or a loved one who has, and you want to understand them better, or if you just want to help the Humanist Hub become an even healthier community, where people can come as they are and help make the world a better place-- this session is meant for you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Join Greg Epstein for his monthly talk at the Hub: with food, music, discussion circles, and more. Childcare available for kids 5 and up.

This will help avoid duplication and inspire a better variety of chili recipes.<\/p> <p>2.<b> Containers<\/b>. I find that the 4 cup twist top storage containers are PERFECT for traveling and storing in the fridge or freezer. Plus, 4 cups of chili makes for a lovely dinner for 2 (or an individual lunch and dinner). See image below. Market Basket has the best selection (or order <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Johnson-18035-Ziploc-Containers-Leak-resistant\/dp\/B0014CS1N6\/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454022089&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=twist+top+containers\">online<\/a>).<b> Remember to buy the 32 ounce size. <\/b>NOTE :: You may want to lightly wash them before filling them with your chili.

Each person is asked to bring a MINIMUM of 8 containers \u2014 <b>6 for swapping + 1 for donating + 1 for sampling<\/b>. You are welcome to bring more than 7 containers, if you're feeling ambitious enough\u2014I say go for it! Essentially, whatever amount you bring for swapping, that's the amount of you'll be bringing home. For example, if you bring 9 containers for swapping, you'll leave with 9 different chilies! <b>NOTE :: <\/b>Even though 10-20 of us will be coming together for this event, you do NOT have to bring 10-20 containers of chili.<\/p> <p>4.<b> Sampling the chili.<\/b> I'm going to have chafing platters set out to display our chili for easy sampling. <b>No crockpots needed<\/b>. One less thing to carry . . . hooray! The tables won't really be near an electrical outlet, anyway. So, of the 8+ containers you're bringing, set one aside for sampling. I'll have bowls set up in the chafing dishes for easy access. There will be plenty of spoons, miniature cups, and chips for tasting. <b>NOTE :: Please bring a list of all the ingredients in your chili (or copies of the recipe are great, too). <\/b>This will be super helpful for everyone involved. Thanks!<\/p> <p>5. <b>Swapping rules.<\/b> Though there will be a great variety of chili for this event, you will NOT be bringing every type of chili home. If you brought 6 containers for swapping, you will be choosing 6 different chilies to take home. During the \"tasting\" portion of the event, you will be making note of the chili you'd like to potentially swap. <b>NOTE :: <\/b>There's no guarantee you're going to get the exact chili you want. It's up to the other person to decide if they want to take YOUR chili home, too. I know, it sounds confusing. I'll explain everything at the event. Trust me . . . it's going to be fun and no one will go home empty-handed!<\/p> <p>6. Empty-handed. That leads me to the <b>charitable<\/b> part of the event. With the abundance of incredible food we'll be sharing together, I feel compelled to have each of us donate a container of chili for those in need. So, I've connected with some local families to whom we'll be giving our chili. The following Monday, I'll drive to their homes to deliver the food. This small gesture will make a huge impact on these families. <b>Thank you for doing your part to make this donation possible.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.jodibeebakes.com\/\">Jodi Bee Bakes<\/a><\/b> is the venue for our vegetarian chili swap.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

Or are you one of those \"in between\" types (raising hand) that can't figure out which\u00a0 generation was starting and which was ending when\u00a0 you were cutting your chops on early adulthood?

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Bitcoin\u2019s underlying protocol, called \u201cthe blockchain\u201d, is a distributed consensus-driven infrastructure enabling trust between connected assets. While currently considered only a financial tool, the blockchain\u2019s actual capability is extremely broad.<\/p> <p>And just as advances in TCP\/IP created vast opportunities for the internet, the blockchain is enabling us to rethink the basic infrastructure of how energy is distributed, accounted for and secured. For example, microgrids could become more resilient with peer-to-peer communications. P2P enables intelligent electronic devices to share information directly without the need for a centralized system.<\/p> <p>Also data about the asset activity, and hence the value, can be exchanged instantaneously 24\/7, giving rise to new business models and applications for many distributed energy sources as well as increasing the security and reliability of the grid.<\/p> <p>We will also have a live demonstration by Grid Singularity on how blockchain can be used in the energy sector.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is the blockchain, really...isn\u2019t it just a financial tool?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why blockchain is and isn\u2019t like the internet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How can entrepreneurs and industry leaders leverage blockchain technology?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What is the business impact, opportunities and potential disintermediation?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are the regulatory hurdles and how might blockchain help us address issues of national security?<\/p> <p>Our distinguished panel will be moderated by:<\/p> <p>Scott Clavenna, CEO, Greentech Media, Inc<\/p> <p>Panelists:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Joi Ito, Director, MIT Media Lab<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Paul Brody, Ernst &amp; Young, America\u2019s Strategy Leader, Technology Sector; Leader, global strategy on Blockchain<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ed Hesse, CEO, Grid Singularity<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Lawrence Orsini, CEO, LO3 Energy<\/p> <p>Sponsored by ConsenSys, GuardTime, and MassCEC<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.uk\/mit-cleantech-committee-explores-how-blockchains-can-distribute-renewable-electricity-1544492\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.uk\/mit-cleantech-committee-explores-how-blockchains-can-distribute-renewable-electricity-1544492\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.uk\/mit-cleantech-committee-explores-how-blockchains-can-distribute-renewable-electricity-1544492<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Ethereum-Enthusiasts\/events\/229006978\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":12600000,"name":"The Blockchain: Enabling a Distributed & Connected Energy Future","id":"229006978","time":1456180200000,"updated":1456194755000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1396014457000,"name":"Boston Ethereum Enthusiasts","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":13597422,"urlname":"Boston-Ethereum-Enthusiasts","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Bees"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":10.1041755676,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454339565000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Your next big client could be standing right next to you.\u00a0But how will you answer the question \u201cWhat do you do\u201d?\u00a0Whether you make the connection with that prospective client may depend on how you respond.\u00a0Many solo professionals struggle to figure out how to talk about what they do in a way that gets other people interested in them.<\/p> <p>If you have this problem, Andrew Winig can help.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/228427080\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvdbdc","time":1456187400000,"updated":1456200895000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"160 Boylston Street","name":"Engagement Game Lab","lon":-71.066681,"id":16472702,"state":"MA","lat":42.352264,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":0.561718583107,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454976343000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Interested in indie board game development?

The average size of an American home is about 2500 square feet, whereas tiny houses typically range from 100 to 400 square feet of living space. To make that small of a space livable, clearly good design is crucial.<\/p> <p>This month we welcome two guests, both architects, who have designed tiny houses. Addison Godine has designed a few tiny houses for Getaway, a Harvard startup that rents out tiny houses a couple hours out of the city for $99\/night. Tracey Powell designed her own tiny house which was featured at ABX in 2015.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right.

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward so we can stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues together as a community. We have seen a surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas. We hope you'll come to this session willing to share your thoughts and knowledge on the events of the past month. If not, feel free to listen, learn, and participate in some really important discussions.

Come explore this compelling question by traveling around the world to discover how different cultures relate to the source of all life! Experience diverse stories from around the globe about our relationship with water: how we are drawn to it, what we learn from it, how we use it, and the consequences of that use. See massive floating abalone farms off China's Fujian coast and the construction site of the biggest arch dam in the world -- the Xiluodu -- six times the size of the Hoover. Visit the barren desert delta where the mighty Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean, and the water-intensive leather tanneries of Dhaka. Witness how humans are drawn to water, from the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach to the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, where thirty million people gather for a sacred bath in the Ganges. Meet scientists who drill ice cores two kilometers deep into the Greenland Ice Sheet, and explore the sublime pristine watershed of Northern British Columbia. Watermark is directed by multiple award-winning filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal and renowned photographer Edward Burtynsky, and is the third part of Burtynsky's Water project, which includes a book \"Burtynsky: Water\" and a major photographic exhibition. Filmed and produced by Nicholas de Pencier and three years in the making, this award-winning film was shot in stunning 5K ultra high-definition video and is full of soaring aerial perspectives.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Join us as Professor Joseph Henrich presents The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter. Henrich is a professor at Harvard's Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, and also co-director of the Centre for Human Evolution, Cognition, and Culture at University of British Columbia. He will be presenting material from his book, The Secret of Our Success, which discusses the role of collective human intelligence in the evolution and development of our species. He will also have copies of his book available for purchase and signing.<\/p> <p><br\/>The lecture starts at 6:00. We will meet outside the entrance to the lecture hall, inside the building at 26 Oxford St., between 5:30 and 5:45, then go in and get seats There should be signs for the event. Doreen and I will be wearing Meetup pins.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>NOTE:<\/b> The entrance to the building is <i>at the front on Oxford St. <\/i>as shown <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Harvard+Museum+of+Natural+History\/@42.3784665,-71.1177463,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e377412f2ed67b:0x613d8c4648bcba7b\">here<\/a>, not around the corner to the side as the map link at the top shows.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you miss us before the lecture, just go on in, and we'll gather again in the hallway afterwards for about 10-15 minutes, then head to a nearby restaurant for food, drinks, and discussion. It shouldn't be that hard to find people and connect.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>*** ABOUT RSVPs ***<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Since it's an open to the public event, there is no need to RSVP to our event page if you just want to attend the lecture only - just come on by and say hello. <i>Your RSVP indicates that you'd like to join us afterwards for the dinner and discussion.<\/i> If we end up being a particularly large group, we may have to split up into a couple of groups to get seated at a restaurant. However, in our past experience of organizing events like this in other Meetup groups,\u00a0 <i>we have never had a situation where there were too many to be seated together<\/i>. There are a few places in Harvard Square, such as Pizzeria Uno and John Harvard's, which can readily accommodate large groups. There are also a few Asian restaurants, and some other good choices. We will decide based on the size of the group.<\/p> <p>Free parking is available at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/52+Oxford+St,+Harvard+University,+Cambridge,+MA+02138\/@42.3801645,-71.1153057,17z\/data=%213m1%214b1%214m2%213m1%211s0x89e37740a3c56959:0xe17bf20973449411\">52 Oxford Street Garage<\/a> (enter off of Oxford St. opposite Everett St. - you may have to tell the attendant at the gate that you're attending the lecture, and they should just let you in).

Countless security firms (and fortunes) were built on the premise of securing PCs - fat, powerful (and power hungry), multi-purpose devices from a short list of threats: viruses, worms, hacking, denial of service attacks and so on.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But in the coming Internet of Things, endpoints will not look or act anything like the PCs of yore. Ubiquitous, geographically dispersed, low power, connected endpoints may well interact and communicate autonomously. The possibilities by which an attacker might move from any one, low value endpoint to other, sensitive IT assets will be impossible to enumerate. What will the information security solutions of the next ten- or 20 years look like?
