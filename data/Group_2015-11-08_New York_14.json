Luckily there is a growing number of safe alternatives available, and many are just as effective, if not more so, than their drugstore equivalents.

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages.

Yes, this includes requests or propositions to stud, sell or buy a dog. Any mention of things eluding to such, whether at the Meetups or on our webpage, will be grounds for removal from the group. 2) This group is comprised of many FRIENDLY, non-dominant or aggressive Frenchies, and we want to keep it that way. Thus while this group is meant for socializing dogs and we do understand that some who are new to the group, or being around other dogs in general, may be overwhelmed at first, we will not tolerate a continual over-aggressor and said party will be asked respectfully to refrain from coming again until their dog is more comfortable in larger-scale situations. 3) Each owner is responsible for the dog(s) they bring. This means you are to be watching, aware and on top of YOUR dog's behavior and actions at all times, specifically their attitudes and cleanliness. While we encourage socializing amongst the human participants, this is ultimately about the dogs' enjoyment, and parents must be steadfast in the monitoring of their personal dogs during play time to make sure that everything is going smoothly and that all dogs are having fun. As stated, over-aggressors will not be tolerated; this includes dogs who hump\/mount\/chase excessively or with aggression, instigate issues with others or actually aggressively bark at, growl or bite other dogs. Additionally, accidents (poop, pee, vomit or otherwise) are the responsibility of each owner to clean up immediately. We often times meet at indoor locations as well as nice community dog parks where we, the North Arlington French Bulldogs Meetup, are responsible for picking up after ourselves in order to be eligible to utilize the spaces. YOU are responsible for cleaning up after your dog promptly, no one else! 4) We require that the health of the dogs who attend Meetups be of the highest standard!! No puppies under the age of 5 months are allowed due to their compromised immune systems and ability to carry and pass germs along more readily than older dogs. Additionally, dogs are not welcome to attend Meetup if their vaccinations are not current (all dogs should be wearing collar and tags for verification) and up to date for their age, if they are in Heat or showing any signs of being close to a breeding cycle, if they've been experiencing or exposed to ANY SIGNS of illness within the last week, or if there are any open sores present on the day of the gathering. 5) Meetups are generally held once a month at varying locations in and around North Arlington, NJ. We do our best to meet in convenient spots, and we are always looking for suggestions of large places our members would like to see us go. Indoor locations are generally only utilized if necessary per the weather, and we try to choose dog parks based on their level of public activity\/cleanliness\/safety as well as the ability to separate small and large breeds from each other. Please understand that this group is solely facilitated by Frenchie owners; no professional trainers or organizers host these events, so while we do our best to keep everything in line and running smoothly, there are times when we may not be able to meet due to extenuating circumstances and\/or things happen that are out of our control. We strive to avoid those times, but we appreciate your flexibility and willingness to go with the flow. 6) Membership to the North Arlington French Bulldogs costs $12 per year. This fee goes towards the rental of any indoor spaces we may meet at throughout the year as well as covering the fee that Meetup.com charges us to use this site for facilitation of the group. In the event that our fund is running low I will ask members to help contribute to the cost of the indoor meetups. Any overage after all monies are collected, will be donated to the French Bulldog Rescue Network for their efforts to rescue and rehabilitate French Bulldogs throughout North America who aren't as lucky as ours. 7) Awesome members make for awesome Meetups!! We are happy to have all who are happy to abide by the rules and be upstanding members of the group!! Remember The Golden Rule, and we'll see you at the next North Arlington French Bulldogs Meetup!!","lon":-74.1299972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182905222,"name":"Wanda"},"members":3,"name":"North Arlington French Bulldogs Meetup","id":18960408,"state":"NJ","urlname":"North-Arlington-French-Bulldogs-Meetup","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Frenchie Aficionados"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443022653000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"motivation","name":"Motivation","id":16433},{"urlkey":"athlete","name":"Athlete","id":20762},{"urlkey":"athletics","name":"Athletics","id":36986},{"urlkey":"mindset","name":"Mindset","id":48786},{"urlkey":"human-development","name":"Human Development","id":74225}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Athlete-Mental-Development-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"Mental development mastermind for current\/former athletes to discuss motivation, and the pressures\/stresses athletes face, and what we can do about it.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","members":5,"name":"Athlete Mental Development in NYC","id":18960554,"state":"NY","urlname":"Athlete-Mental-Development-in-NYC","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Athletes"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hasbrouck Heights","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443025151000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bourbon","name":"Bourbon","id":3644},{"urlkey":"whiskey","name":"Whiskey","id":10035},{"urlkey":"horology","name":"Horology","id":15434},{"urlkey":"single-malt-scotch-whisky","name":"Single Malt Scotch Whisky","id":37843},{"urlkey":"watch-collectors","name":"Watch Collectors","id":48069},{"urlkey":"watches","name":"Watches","id":54703},{"urlkey":"scotch-and-cigar-enthusiasts","name":"Scotch and Cigar Enthusiasts","id":58418},{"urlkey":"wristwatch","name":"Wristwatch","id":77402},{"urlkey":"time-pieces-and-watches","name":"Time Pieces and Watches","id":85431},{"urlkey":"whisky-appreciation","name":"Whisky Appreciation","id":103867},{"urlkey":"whiskey-tasting","name":"Whiskey Tasting","id":246861},{"urlkey":"swiss-watches-and-timepieces","name":"Swiss watches and timepieces","id":395911},{"urlkey":"wristwatches-and-pocket-watches","name":"Wristwatches and pocket watches","id":395921},{"urlkey":"whisky-tastings","name":"Whisky Tastings","id":633352},{"urlkey":"watch-enthusiasts","name":"watch enthusiasts","id":944982}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hasbrouck-Heights-Swiss-Watches-and-Whiskey-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling all Watch and Whiskey Lovers!

It's a forum for sharing and discussing new research and exciting advances in theoretical physics and computational biology. Several approaches to unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity, influenced in part by the discovery of the holographic principle, prompt us to break up spacetime itself into chucks (the same way we break down matter into particles). Matter and the laws of physics, then, emerge from the changing of the states of these chunks based on the states of neighboring chunks, as though our universe is one large cellular automaton - a computer program. I recommend the paper by Tommaso Bolognesi entitled \"Algorithmic Causal Sets for a Computational Spacetime,\" which can be found in Hector Zenil's collection of essays \"A Computable Universe: Understanding and Exploring Nature as Computation.\" There's also a TV program named Closer to Truth that dedicates some episodes to exploring information as the fundamental reality and the universe as a computation. But wait, I thought matter and energy are fundamental!?! Well, \"Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement...\" of matter and energy. There is a proof by contradiction that everything (matter, mind, and processes) is composed of information, and there is another proof by contradiction that information cannot be reduced to matter. If information is the fundamental reality and the complexity of physics emerges from simplicity, it prompts a scientific paradigm shift from a top-down to a bottom-up understanding of nature. In the study of the mind, Tononi's Integrated Information Theory is one example of an approach to resolve the hard problem of consciousness using information as the fundamental ingredient. I recommend the paper \"Is Consciousness Computable? Quantifying Integrated Information Using Algorithmic Information Theory.\" Gregory Chaitlin's metabiology is an interesting attempt to model evolution in the framework of algorithmic information theory. Let's see if we can pull together the pieces of the puzzle of existence and evolution.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/highres_442347205.jpeg","photo_id":442347205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/600_442347205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/thumb_442347205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":153712592,"name":"Dan"},"members":46,"name":"Digital Philosophy, Consciousness, and Quantum Gravity","id":18962475,"state":"NY","urlname":"Digital-Philosophy-Consciousness-and-Quantum-Gravity","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"combinatorial hierarchies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Fresh Meadows","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443075040000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"sensual-and-erotic-education","name":"Sensual and Erotic Education","id":20593},{"urlkey":"pornography","name":"Pornography","id":61951},{"urlkey":"pornography-addiction","name":"Pornography Addiction","id":78793},{"urlkey":"celebrate-sensuality","name":"Sensuality","id":93385}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pornandpizza\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is inspired by the famous Yale group, Porn and Chicken.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting?

I am a father of an amazing 16 month old boy who is the center of my universe. I work Mon-Fri, dusk till dawn saving for all the wonderful things we want to provide our son with. This leaves me little time to connect with other parents and to meet other parents that share the same family focused lifestyle that we live. Now we all know how it goes...Lots of friends and going out and social time before the baby...but after the baby comes, you just don't have the time to do all of that anymore and those friends without kids seem to drift away slowly but surely...So this is the reason I am starting this group. I'm a dad who loves football (especially fantasy football and watching football on Sundays), loves going out to eat, loves dressing my son up as cute as possible to get the most people to compliment him as possible when I take him out (admit it, we all do it!). I'm looking to meetup with easy going people who will connect with the much more simplistic lifestyle of having kids but still want to meet up and have fun once every week or two. Kids are welcome for any meetups, I mean heck, that's the whole purpose I'm posting this is because we are parents! We can meet at parks, restaurants, houses, etc... Essentially wherever people feel will be best. Just a dad, looking to connect with other dads. Sunday football outings with or without the kids would definitely be a plus! :)","lon":-73.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193235116,"name":"Joseph Perez"},"members":11,"name":"Forest Hills Dads Meetup","id":18967515,"state":"NY","urlname":"Forest-Hills-Dads-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dads having fun with other dads"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Metuchen","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443213006000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"sleepdisorders","name":"Sleeping Disorder","id":1926},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"solve-sleep-problems","name":"Solve Sleep Problems","id":56199},{"urlkey":"sleep","name":"Sleep","id":119381},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating-for-energy-and-good-health","name":"Healthy Eating For Energy and Good Health","id":444332}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Central-Jersey-Sleep-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a support group for people who find it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Certain tools and techniques are available \u2013 Yoga, breathing Techniques and meditation \u2013 that help us get rid of stress and negative emotions.

While being \"active\" is subjective, I would say a good attendance of 20+ without \"no-show\" is a good indication.<br>As EO, one would reserve the court, post and host the event. He can also place all RSVP on wait list from which the EO would pick out the final tennists before the event date.<br>As a courtesy to the EO and members on waiting list, please change RSVP well in advance. The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.<br>EO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.<br>EO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.<br>From time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.<br>Members' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.<br>Professional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.<br>From time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game.

Let's explore this important new text together from the beginning and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers. Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week. It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of A Course in Miracles, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. A COURSE OF LOVE builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth. Classes are $20 and class cards are available. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. Read more... You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here: http:\/\/crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday ACIM class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing). He produces arts\/cultural\/educational events at the Center, leads Inner Vision Workouts, and works as a CRS Healer and teacher of A Course in Miracles. In addition to studying ACIM with Yasuko Kasaki since 2003, he studied the Spiritual Psychology of Acting with London-based teacher John Osborne Hughes and Keith Johnstone-based Improvisation with the late Gloria Maddox.

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give.

It's a Movement born out of a weariness with the status quo that puts HR leaders and doers in a box. WGNinHR is busting us out of those boxes, and breaking all paradigms. It's for those who dare to ask 'what's next?', expecting to be challenged to new levels in HR - or even outside of it...to the C-Suite and perhaps, eventually, to the top seat. After launching as a (virtual) membership organization (<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgninhr.org\">www.wgninhr.org<\/a><\/b>), WGNinHR is now ready to establish a NY presence. If you'd like to meet like-minded HR pros looking for creative ways to advance their careers, join this growing Movement - and become a part of our Meetup. &nbsp;The Meetups will include networking, light refreshments and interactive learning opportunities!<\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s in a Name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On playgrounds across the nation, and maybe even the globe, someone is screaming out a familiar question \u2013 \u2018who\u2019s got next?!\u2019&nbsp; The question is asked of the person confident enough to step onto the court or playground, grab the ball \u2013 and then do something <i>amazing<\/i> with it.&nbsp; That\u2019s where the name for this organization came from.&nbsp; Its focus is on the HR professional who dares to not only ask the \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 question, but to shape the answer! <\/p>\n<p>This is a Movement looking to challenge your thinking, and that of the folks who surround you who may be suffocating your career aspirations, perhaps unintentionally. The fact is, too many HR pros are convinced that they can\u2019t aspire to more \u2013 in their fields, outside their fields, to the C-Suite and even to the CEO seat.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is for you.&nbsp; Whether you\u2019re the aspiring HR pro having just graduated and in your first HR gig, or the more seasoned among us with 20+ years of HR and business experience.&nbsp; This is for you <i>if <\/i>you truly believe that there\u2019s more to your career story.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>NY Trailblazers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The goal is a monthly meetup like no other.&nbsp; Yes, there will be networking which is awesome. Yes, there will be refreshments to give us the energy boost at the end of a day.&nbsp; But, we\u2019ll strive for even more.&nbsp; Creativity.&nbsp; Innovation.&nbsp; New \u2013 and quirky \u2013 thinking about old issues and hot topics which impact HR leaders aspiring for more.&nbsp; Interactive learning sessions will serve as incubators for ideas that may ultimately position HR leaders as the smartest people in the room\u2026.whether it\u2019s the conference room or the board room.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want to Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If this group resonates with you, we\u2019d love to have you!

We operate fully within all state and local laws and we fully support ALL of our Oath abiding Law Enforcement and First Responders. We will provide a forum for both, individuals and Patriotic groups, to come together in support of one another and share their goals, views, and expertise in related fields. We are not \u201cjust another Facebook page.\" We are proactive in our goals. We strive to provide our Patriots with the most up to date news and information as possible. We also offer opportunities to meet and train with like-minded people face to face. Our ultimate goal is to not only provide support to all other Patriotic groups, but to form a logistical support network and a response team to help our communities, in the event of a State emergency. We hope to provide a faster and more personal response than government agencies can or will provide.

To keep our monologues fresh and kick-ass, I'm creating this meetup so we can practice with each other and be ready when opportunity knocks. Everyone will have a chance to perform at least one (two minute) monologue. Then, your peers (us) will give you feedback \/ suggested adjustments. Take 'em or leave 'em. Then you perform it again. Depending on turnout, we may each do this again with a second monologue. Unless someone has access to free professional space, I will rent space at one of the NY rehearsal studios - in which case, there'll be a small fee to cover the rental space (divide cost of space by number of attendees). So - location TBA. If successful, I'd very much like to do this regularly. So - who's in?

This is about dialectics, discourse, and discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Each week a topic or theme will be presented around ideas or thoughts from the realms of science, western philosophy, eastern philosophy, and literature. I draw on the world of many great western minds, including: Thoreau, Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, Sun Tzu, Epictetus, Jung, Aquinas, Fromm, James..\u2026 and as a Sanskrit theorist I draw on many of the ancient Vedic texts, the Mahabharata, The Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Upanishads, The Bengali poets and scholars, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the topics will be about yoga, science, meditation, philosophy, and basically all things that can be used to help us explore how to both think more clearly and at the same time reside happily in the cloud of unknowing.<\/p>\n<p>Each week I will offer a presentation about the topic that is no more than 17 minutes long.&nbsp;We will then have a discussion on the topic, and sharing time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>So, remember to bring something that inspires you to share. It can be a piece of music, a photo, a poem, or even a short anecdote.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>I will close the session with some brief remarks, and then go to brunch, or, if the weather is nice, on a picnic.

I speak four languages and can read and write Sanskrit. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in educational psychology. I am spiritual, but not religious. I am agnostic, but not atheistic. I am rational, but not close-minded. I am here to be of service to others. I like art, history, science, music, literature, and things that buzz or blink. I think coming together as a community on Sunday mornings has value, but I\u2019m not into church. I want to grow and learn in the company of my peers, and friends, free from the dictates of dogma and blue hair.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I have created Voki-all-joyo (phonetic for voki al \u011dojo.) This is Esperanto (one of my favorite languages) for Call to Joy. I named it this because I am convinced that our constitutional position as spirits in a human form is to be full of joy. I aIso feel strongly that clear thinking is the best path to real joy. Please note, when I say, \u2018be full of joy\u2019, I do not mean joy in some horribly homogeneous way, like a narcotized, monolithically emotional state.

This comes in many forms, whether it is an individual deciding to turn their car off while waiting to pick up a friend instead of idling or a food service provider choosing to to donate their excess inventory at the end of a day instead of throwing it out; these are only two examples out of hundreds, maybe thousands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have turned many of these actions into programs and campaigns and are always looking for opportunities to grow them or develop new ones. By building a face-to-face community, we hope to engage more of the Stamford community in our work and make our city a leader in food and transportation fuel sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sustainable America is a national non-profit located in Stamford, CT. We focus on our nation's food and transportation fuel systems because they are inextricably connected and not as robust as they may appear. Through educational programming and partnerships with corporations and entrepreneurs we are making a big impact as we work to reduce oil consumption and increase food availability around the country.<\/p>\n<p>On behalf of the staff of Sustainable America, welcome and thank you for your interest. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. You can also visit our website, www.sustainableamerica.org for more info. We can't wait to meet you!&nbsp; <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192069817,"name":"Katy Franklin"},"members":20,"name":"Food for thought.

Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw.

If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)?

Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

Your questions and reports lead us into a deep inquiry of what is true beyond the stories we tell ourselves. Satsang with Tathina meetings welcome every aspect of this human experience as sacred invitations to Self discovery. <\/p>\n<p>Satsang is not the space to attain knowledge or accrue more concepts, Satsang is the space where you let go of everything. In doing this, the true attainment can happen. This is a retreat from the narratives one gives attention to on a daily basis to discover the Freedom that is always Here. This silent space is where there is no seeker, no teacher, no student, just THIS celebration. Join us if this resonates and you feel called to come. :)<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>Meet Tathina:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> Tathina (tah-tee-nuh)&nbsp;is originally from Southern New Jersey and started searching for true fulfillment senior year in college when she took Eastern religion classes alongside her psychology major classes in 2009. After graduating from college she had an unstoppable urge to search for Truth. She searched through many paths and teachers, but nothing quenched this thirst. <\/p>\n<p>During this period she was retreating from the world much more and she was brought to her teacher\/guru <a href=\"http:\/\/samarpan.de\/home.aspx?sflang=en\">Samarpan<\/a> of Germany via the internet when she realized she needed guidance beyond her mind. He gave&nbsp;her the name Tathina meaning \"unlimited\" in 2013 and she went from Jennifer to Tathina. He pointed her to Truth, to this space where there was no seeker. She discovered there was no seeker, no one separate from THAT, Life, Peace,&nbsp;and never had been and this discovery becomes more obvious when one is in peace with being totally human. This is when the divinity of Existence can be seen in this moment. <\/p>\n<p>She shares this invitation, wherever&nbsp;invited,&nbsp;with people who come to her in Satsang. She is the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Invitation-Live-Truth-Tathina\/dp\/1507888112\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430856287&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tathina\">The Invitation (to Live) (the Truth)<\/a> and shares free articles and fun meditation challenges and much more on her website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tathina.com\/\">tathina.com<\/a> and blog <a href=\"https:\/\/theinvitationtolivethetruth.wordpress.com\/\">theinvitationtolivethetruth.wordpress.<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/e\/f\/600_442998415.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~* Namaste' * ~<\/strong> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/1\/5\/highres_442997685.jpeg","photo_id":442997685,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/1\/5\/600_442997685.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/1\/5\/thumb_442997685.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185434436,"name":"Tathina"},"members":16,"name":"Satsang with Tathina","id":19021038,"state":"CT","urlname":"Satsang-with-Tathina","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Fellow Adventurers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444680937000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"tea","name":"Tea","id":230},{"urlkey":"tea-party","name":"Tea Party","id":15288},{"urlkey":"chinese-tea","name":"Chinese Tea","id":15493},{"urlkey":"tea-tasting","name":"Tea Tasting","id":15703},{"urlkey":"book-club-tea-brunch","name":"BOOK CLUB - TEA - BRUNCH","id":18862},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-while-knitting","name":"Coffee\/Tea While Knitting","id":21868},{"urlkey":"chat-over-tea-coffee","name":"Chat Over Tea\/Coffee","id":29999},{"urlkey":"high-tea","name":"High Tea","id":30029},{"urlkey":"tea-appreciation","name":"Tea Appreciation","id":32098},{"urlkey":"afternoon-tea","name":"Afternoon Tea","id":42494},{"urlkey":"tea-yarn-tea-knitting-crochet","name":"TEA & Yarn:  tea & knitting\/crochet","id":138366},{"urlkey":"afternoon-tea-tea-lovers","name":"Afternoon tea & tea lovers","id":1430102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Simple-Tea\/","rating":0,"description":"a place to explore different types of tea leaves from different region, tea tasting, and tea pairing.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":101285462,"name":"Jing Wu"},"members":44,"name":"Simple Tea","id":19021050,"state":"NY","urlname":"Simple-Tea","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444694972000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"technology-professionals","name":"Technology Professionals","id":22203},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"apis","name":"APIs","id":80749},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Postlight\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p>Postlight is an agency that builds big, beautiful tech things.<\/p>\n<p><span>We're a team that turns huge ideas into web and mobile products. &nbsp;Whatever that takes, we do it.

The chefs stuff the flaky crepe dough with such savory fillings including Atlantic salmon, steak and lemon-pepper grilled chicken, and then top the creations off with your choice of tasty cheeses and fresh herbs. All the beef and poultry that go into the crepes are antibiotic-free, and none of our gustatory delights contain preservatives, additives or black magic. Our shop also hits dulcet notes with dessert crepes, pastries and confections. We pack those crepes full of sweet fillings, such as fresh fruit, before crowning them with more fresh fruit and drizzling Nutella on top. Our menu's other international flavors take shape in the form of buttery croissants, gelato, and tartlets, which pair well with organic coffee and teas.","lon":-74.1200027466,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192299380,"name":"Bachas Tony"},"members":29,"name":"Lyndhurst good Tea and coffee Meetup","id":19025644,"state":"NJ","urlname":"LyndhurstOrganicCoffee-Teas","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Go Healthy-Organic Coffee & Teas"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444790600000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"buddhist-meditation","name":"Buddhist Meditation","id":16887},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"breathing-meditation","name":"Breathing Meditation","id":19570},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"insight-meditation","name":"Insight Meditation","id":26307},{"urlkey":"mind-body-connection","name":"Mind Body Connection","id":31781},{"urlkey":"mindfulness-meditation","name":"Mindfulness Meditation","id":70577},{"urlkey":"genuine-happiness-and-mindfulness-meditation","name":"Genuine Happiness and mindfulness meditation","id":127559},{"urlkey":"buddhist","name":"Buddhist","id":128602},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-mindfulness","name":"Meditation and Mindfulness","id":153091},{"urlkey":"awareness-and-mindfulness","name":"Awareness and Mindfulness","id":197871},{"urlkey":"breathwork-meditation-guided-meditation","name":"Breathwork Meditation & Guided Meditation","id":1429922}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Insight-Montclair\/","rating":4.67,"description":"<p>Inspired by the online community of Insight Timer (the meditation app), we're creating a local group for those who seek to explore a mindfulness practice and how it applies to our lives.

The sum total of your life experiences.&nbsp; Everyone\u2019s is different and the more times you step outside it, the bigger your box gets. <\/p>\n<p><strong> There\u2019s just one little problem.<\/strong> Your life inside your box is where you are the most comfortable. It\u2019s safe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ask \u201cwhy should I live outside my box?\u201d<\/strong> Well, there are many reasons. First, and most important, it helps you GROW as a person. You will see the world in a different way. You will learn new things, meet new people and become more of the person you\u2019re supposed to be. When you grow, you have more to offer others and you get back more from them. In short, you will live a more successful life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ask \u201cHow does one live life outside the box?\u201d<\/strong> It will take a lot of courage but you CAN DO IT! Start small and get bigger. Try something new\u2026 maybe try a new cuisine you\u2019ve never tried before. Try to do something that you wouldn\u2019t normally do. For example, learn indoor rock climbing. Take a cooking class. Do something that\u2019s not already in your box. You have to do something NEW. Something different. Something that you have never done before.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As you get comfortable with small steps, take bigger steps<\/strong>. Skydive. Speak in front of a group of people. Perform in a play. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do as long as you step outside of your comfort zone to do it and you keep growing your comfort zone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eventually, you will be able to take a giant leap.<\/strong> Is there something in your life that you\u2019ve wanted to do, but have been afraid to do it? Face up to it and do it. This is when you begin to direct your steps so that you can get the life you want. <\/p>\n<p><strong>As you grow and your box grows<\/strong>, you will begin to focus your steps in a positive way. It becomes easier.&nbsp; Every time you take a step, your vision expands, you grow as a person. Your box gets a little bigger. You move to a higher purpose just as you were meant to do.<\/p>\n<p>One of our greatest sources of authentic power in life comes from our willingness and ability to act \u2013 especially in the face of obstacles and fear. <\/p>\n<p>To be truly successful and fulfilled, we must challenge ourselves to take bold and courageous actions and to go for and do what we want.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT GROUP RULES: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group.

Personally, I've always participated in team sports or activities like football, wrestling, rugby, and martial arts. What keeps me coming back and engaged is the community and camaraderie inherent in these group activities. Weightlifting is another matter though. I know my way around a gym, but lifting alone is difficult for me. The lack of accountability and engagement usually leads me to modifying routines that shouldn't be modified or abandoning lifting all together and focussing on my group activities (Currently Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). So my goal for this group is to find some more buddies who want to partner with me on lifting. I'm going to be on the program outlined in \"Man 2.0, Engineering the Alpha.\" This group is for guys like me, to find other guys like me, so that we can do this together! While I have a specific program that I want to engage, this group will serve as a hub for other guys in our situation to meet one another, find someone else who wants to engage in a program of your choosing and move onward!","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":42906772,"name":"Shane"},"members":10,"name":"Personal Revolution Workout Buddies","id":19029933,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Personal-Revolution-Workout-Buddies","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Savages"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444920289000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"korean","name":"Korean Language","id":862},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"business-in-china","name":"Business in China","id":16053},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"learning-chinese","name":"Learning Chinese","id":56708},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584},{"urlkey":"asian-singles-30s-40s","name":"Asian Singles 30s 40s","id":96692},{"urlkey":"asian-americans-30s-40s","name":"Asian Americans 30s 40s","id":96694},{"urlkey":"mandarin-chinese","name":"Mandarin Chinese","id":127454},{"urlkey":"movies-and-movie-watching","name":"Movies and Movie Watching","id":280301}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asian-NYC-Watching-Movies-Weekend-Events\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for Asians or anyone interested in joining movies and cultural events, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. I started this group because I am a big fan of cinema but I hate to go see a movie alone.

Over the years I have only practiced strategies used by the wealthy and it has transformed my life from not being able to afford most things to now-being able to live a life free of financial boundaries. As a result I wanted to share what I've learned from self-improvement and the only way I could do that was to create a new word, \"Selfceed\". Selfceed means to succeed in self, building a sound character that runs on a core philosophy of, you are what you attract by the person you become. &nbsp;The Selfceed Forum is essentially a <b><i>book club forum<\/i><\/b> designed to help members make more money, manage their time and problems better by interacting with like-minded individuals who practice self-improvement.

From a self-defense aspect it can end an attack suddenly, severely and decisively or dissipate it with the gentleness of a soft breeze. <\/p>\n<p> <br>Aikido's unique approach is to blend with an attack rather than clash with it. The attack is redirected safely away into a throw or pin. Its circular, flowing techniques are effective and can be learned by anyone regardless of size, age or gender. Men, women, children and seniors all find it appealing because Aikido techniques are not based on pitting one's strength against another's. Students learn to defend themselves without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Self esteem, concentration, awareness and focusing power are enhanced. Balance and calmness are therefore maintained in all situations. This state of being is then carried off the mat and into the activity and interactions of daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers was established in 1988 after Sensei O'Connor had been studying and teaching for 12 years.

For example, a technique does not work by itself unless combined with the concepts of balance, power, speed, focus, timing, and attitude. When combining these elements, the outcome or whole is far more effective then what would normally be the sum of the parts. This is the reason techniques, as practiced in the system, are only tools used to understand, accept and retain these ideas. The number of different techniques mastered by an individual does not increase his level of competence in this system. Techniques are only practiced moves until combined with the proper fighting concepts. The ultimate goal of the martial arts is to make your mental, physical and technical skills work as one. The goal of Latosa Escrima is to do this while producing a quality Escrimador who can think creatively and react responsively rather than giving people information overload. Escrima was the original name used under the flag of the Philippine Martial Arts Society. The name changed to Combat Escrima as the system was influenced by the concept of using power and combat reality. Combat Escrima relied on a single goal; winning. This goal proved to be a very valuable asset. The intimidation factor of the name \"Combat Escrima\" was something the students felt they had to defend. However, just the goal of winning actually proved limiting in the progression of the system and future instructors. PMAS produced excellent fighters and world champions but failed to produce very many well-rounded instructors. PMAS had the box recipe for producing competent fighters but failed to isolate the individual ingredients that make up the end product. Latosa spent his time developing training methods used to understand the reasoning behind the techniques and isolating the concepts of Escrima. Wing Tzun is self defense in it's most consequent form Wing Tzun is the smartest self-defense system ever thought of by humankind, because Wing Tzun is not based upon physical strength or acrobatic ability and therefore allows a physically weaker person to defend him\/herself. Wing Tzun teaches you to use the force of the opponent and turn it against him. Wing Tzun self defense movements derive from tactile reflexes that are mechanical and directly determined by the attack of the opponent. In this way WT is not susceptible to optical manipulations meant to mislead the fighter. Wing Tzun can be learned fairly quickly and built upon. Wing Tzun meets the demands of \"appropriate force\" and therefore lends itself for use by law enforcement.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192115611,"name":"Rawb Prime"},"members":8,"name":"Latosa Escrima and Wing Tsun Meetup","id":19036470,"state":"NY","urlname":"Latosa-Escrima-and-Wing-Tsun-Meetup","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Escrimadors and Technicians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445132274000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sake","name":"Sake","id":9744},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-food","name":"Japanese Food","id":25545},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"sake-tasting","name":"Sake Tasting","id":72368},{"urlkey":"sake-pairing","name":"sake pairing","id":136330},{"urlkey":"japanese-sake","name":"Japanese sake","id":242661},{"urlkey":"japanese-food-and-culture","name":"Japanese food and Culture","id":344101},{"urlkey":"japanese-food-culture","name":"Japanese food culture","id":1215142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sakeplus-ny\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To drink up with sake lovers from all over the world!<\/p>\n<p>We select only delicious sake for a season, and we invite sake professionals like Touji (sake brewers), Kikizake-shi (sake sommelier).<\/p>\n<p>Let's enjoy cheers!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/highres_443142114.jpeg","photo_id":443142114,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/600_443142114.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/thumb_443142114.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182462174,"name":"Yuki Ono"},"members":31,"name":"[SAKE+] Sake Samurai in NY!","id":19036932,"state":"NY","urlname":"sakeplus-ny","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sake Samurai"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445133911000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"dating-relationship-advice","name":"Dating & Relationship Advice","id":70113},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613},{"urlkey":"dating-advice-for-women","name":"Dating Advice For Women","id":145615}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rules-Dating-Advice-For-Women-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is the first Meetup group that encourages &amp; supports The Rules.

Participants will learn how to develop their musicianship more quickly by utilizing modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam groups since 2010. &nbsp;The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the ABB. &nbsp;These sessions are a lot of fun. &nbsp;Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the ABB with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.&nbsp; Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.&nbsp; Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.&nbsp; Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. &nbsp;Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.&nbsp; Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN: <\/p>\n<p>The music of The Allman Brothers Band is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. &nbsp;However, learning the music of the ABB can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I can help you learn. &nbsp;This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the ABB played it. &nbsp;The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.&nbsp; I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.&nbsp; The charts are clear about song form,&nbsp;intros, &nbsp;chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.&nbsp; Both Duane Allman and Dicky Betts' parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In most cases, Berry Oakley's bass lines have been transcribed. &nbsp;The ABB shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose. <\/p>\n<p>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN: <\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord&nbsp;progressions and song&nbsp;forms; the actual chord voicings;&nbsp;specific chord progressions used during the improv sections; slide guitar techniques; pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;&nbsp;chord\/scale combinations; use of chromaticism; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation to improvise.&nbsp; There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.&nbsp; People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation. <\/p>\n<p>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. &nbsp;In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on many songs including: &nbsp; Staesboro Blues, Trouble No More, Don't Keep me Wonderin', Done Somebody Wrong, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Dreams, Blue Sky, Hot 'Lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Little Martha, Midnight Rider, Mountain Jam, Stormy Monday, Whipping Post, You Don't Love Me and others.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE COORDINATOR:<\/p>\n<p>I am a professional musician with over 40 years experience. I began playing the guitar at four years old and performing professionally at 15. &nbsp;I've performed all over the world at countless venues and festivals. &nbsp;Additionally, I teach privately and at a variety of music schools. &nbsp;As a performer and recording artist I play many styles of music including rock, blues, jazz and folk.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/highres_443233561.jpeg","photo_id":443233561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/600_443233561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_443233561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13972016,"name":"Luke Johnson"},"members":12,"name":"New York City Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam","id":19041096,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Allman-Brothers-Band-Song-and-Jam","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"ABB Jammers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445265527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"black-singles","name":"Black Singles","id":17053},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-datengamenyc-com\/","rating":1,"description":"<p>Date N Game is a social networking event for young professionals to meet and network.

In this lively, interactive workshop, Robert Vetter deconstructs processes of spiritual healing found in cultures found all over the world, and shares a formula for healing that can be adapted to almost any energetic or spiritual healing discipline. By looking at the methods of other cultures, you will understand on a deeper level what healing is, how it works, and the ways that various healers master a universal code that underlies the healing process.\n\nWorkshop topics include:\n\n\u2022 Understanding your calling as a healer\n\u2022 Developing a healing presence\n\u2022 Respectfully borrowing healing practices from other cultures\n\u2022 Constructing altars to invoke the power of symbols in healing\n\u2022 Engaging all 5 senses in healing\n\u2022 Grasping a deeper meaning that underlies the wounded healer archetype\n\u2022 Methods of self-protection that you can implement in your practice\n\u2022 The power of narrative medicine: using words to heal\n\u2022 Acquiring healing energy\n\u2022 Soul retrieval and re-integration\n\nDuring this workshop, you will develop your own unique healing protocol that is a reflection of who you are on your individual journey. In learning to heal using this method, you will also uncover how healing is a spiritual path that directs us through the entire cycle of human life, imbuing it with meaning and purpose.\n\nRobert Vetter, M.A. is a cultural anthropologist, who began his studies of cross cultural healing practices at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980\u2019s. He has apprenticed and learned from a variety of teachers in modalities that include traditional Mesoamerican medicine (Curanderismo), Native North American medicine, and Medical or Healing Qigong among others. He maintains a healing practice in what he calls Ethno-Energetic Healing. He is the co-author (along with his adopted uncle, Kiowa medicine man, Richard Tartsah) of the book Big Bow: The Spiritual Life and Teachings of a Kiowa Family. He is vice president of Joshua\u2019s Place Center for Healing in Southampton, NY. He has taught at the New York Open Center, Wainwright House, Mount Madonna Center in the San Francisco Bay area, The Sanctuary at Mount Shasta, and many other venues.\n\nExchange: $65","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":72465082,"name":"Awakening NY"},"members":15,"name":"Healing Spirituality As A Life Journey","id":19041709,"state":"NY","urlname":"Healing-Spirituality-As-A-Life-Journey","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Healers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445273477000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-health","name":"Women's Health","id":16973},{"urlkey":"natural-health","name":"Natural Health","id":17124},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"womens-support-group-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Support Group Health and Wellness","id":94489},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477},{"urlkey":"womens-sexual-health","name":"Women's Sexual Health","id":222511},{"urlkey":"women-health","name":"Women health","id":1407762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Premenstrual-Dysphoric-Disorder-PMDD-Support\/","rating":0,"description":"PMDD is more than a little bloating and cramping before a period. It is a mood disorder that accompanies the other premenstrual symptoms. The PMDD gets more severe as the period draws near, escalating the sufferer to a state of very high tension, anxiety and aggression. It enhances other coexisting mood disorders to complicate any treatment for several days during the month. PMDD is thought to be a brain chemistry malfunction that is triggered by ovulation. Symptoms usually begin after ovulation and last into the first days of the period. This cycle repeats itself every month. PMDD is tied to the hormonal changes triggered by ovulation, so it does not occur without this part of the menstrual cycle. The condition affects up to 8 percent of women. The condition involves much more than a bad time during a period. It is cyclical, occurring at the same point in the menstrual cycle each month. The symptoms of PMDD are severe and usually life altering. Doctors require sufferers to have at least five of the following symptoms to support a diagnosis: Depression of hopeless feelings Feelings of anxiousness, tension or edge Irritability that increases as period nears Oversleeping or insomnia Lack of interest in favorite things No motivation Loss of energy Difficulty focusing and concentrating Loss of control feelings, feeling overwhelmed Severe physical manifestation of PMS symptoms like tender breasts, cramping, bloating, muscle pain and weight gain Suicidal thoughts Source: http:\/\/www.psychguides.com\/guides\/living-with-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\/ Message from Organizer: Last year I learned that I have PMDD. The only thing I found that truly helps the mental aspect of PMDD is joining online forums where other women discuss their experiences with PMDD, thus learning that I am not alone. I am making this group so members can meet and give support to other PMDD suffers. I'm calling the members \"Lunar Girls\" because of how we're affected by our cycle, much like the moon. I thought about calling us werewolves but that seemed a bit extreme.

Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter. The Song Club is led by the founder of the Collective -Peter Bliss. The Collective Song Club\u201d will begin on October 14th and follow every other Wednesday evening (skipping the night before Thanksgiving). It will take place at Planet Studio NYC (www.planetstudionyc.com) 244 West 54th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue in Suite 800B on the 8th floor. It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like! There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage! The CSC is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see! Join us for our first session on October 14th and let\u2019s see what happens! Peter Bliss \/ Profile: Peter Bliss songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties. He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film. He\u2019s shared his expertise creating workshop and event programs for the Songwriters Hall of Fame and now the New York Songwriters Collective. Peter works from his \u201cPlanet Studio NYC\u201d recording studios located in Manhattan, arranging, recording and producing other artists to help bring their music to life.

Stretch, Risk, Die. This Intro talk is going to give you such a great boost for the New Year! You will learn something new about yourself and your place in the world.&nbsp; The people who choose to join this group are people who are tired of letting fear and uncertainty run their lives. People who want to experience clarity and direction. This group is about taking you where you are and moving you forward in specific areas of your life. We will talk and share our fears,&nbsp;struggles and triumphs. Are you brave enough to take the first step in being fearless? If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s not a coincidence. You\u2019re ready to live your biggest, most fearless life. Keep reading to find out how... Have you ever felt stuck in your life? You can't quite figure out what's stopping you but you can't quite get yourself going either? Have you ever had a recurring problem that just won't go away? You thought you solved it once but oh no, that same problem just keeps popping up again and again. Have you ever felt like you should be doing something different or something better than you are but you're not sure what it is or how to change it? It can be so maddening to know something has got to change but you can't quite put your finger on it. That was how I used to feel all the time but it didn't make sense. I made good money. Had good friends. I'm smart and loved by my family. I couldn't figure out why I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough. What I learned is that battling your confidence every day and feeling overwhelmed, stressed and out of balance is not normal. Fearless living showed me that. In her Book, Fearless Living, Rhonda Britten teaches people how to master fear. She has created a method for anyone anywhere to master the insidious fear we all have of \u2018not being good enough.\u2019 What she teaches is what she\u2019s lived.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8784070,"name":"L.

FINALLY, a \" Meet Up\" for high functioning young adults living at home or a group home. I am specifically talking about the young people with disabilities that can do so much more socially and want to, but that their socialization some how ends at the programs they attend for various reasons. They do not have friends in the neighborhood, and want to \"fit in\" so badly but don't! Parents, I say ENOUGH, it's got to start with us! Please if you are as frustrated as I am, lets get together, and HELP! Lets help and brainstorm and make this happen! I personally, have a 32 yr old high functioning daughter at home, who is lucky enough to have a 34 yr. old sister who loves and adores her. But as we all know 'its not enough\"! These young people need friends, they need their peers! They need movie dates, bowling dates, parties to attend, or just taking turn hang out at each others house. Parents, as you have already found out the first step to help will always be family. I am looking for dedicated mothers, fathers, sisters , brothers or whoever that family member might consist of. If your plain tired and sad of seeing your grown young adult home alone on the entire weekend with no plans , no friends, or sitting in their room watching a funny movie alone then reach out and lets move forward together. It just begins with one or two of us to start a network of friends for are kids, then before you know it, they are no longer alone!<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski"},"members":5,"name":"Socializing For High Functioning Young Adults in Westchester","id":19048902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Socializing-For-High-Functioning-Young-Adults","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"True Friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445457886000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence","id":10538},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"qlikview","name":"Qlikview","id":60832},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-tools-and-technology","name":"Business Intelligence Tools and Technology","id":148287},{"urlkey":"qlik-sense","name":"Qlik Sense","id":1505900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Qlikview-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone utilizing QlikView or&nbsp;Tableau&nbsp;on the BI Platform.

But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute.

Exploring different ethnic restaurants in Queens and sampling their delicious ethnic foods is a must, whether you live in Queens, in NYC or are just visiting. Eating in an ethnic restaurant is about more than just the food, it\u2019s a cultural experience that gives you a literal taste of life in another land. <\/p>\n<p>If you enjoy dining on good food, meet new people in a fun and relaxed environment, then come join us and together we will eat our way through a cornucopia of exotic cuisines representing all corners of the globe \u2026 all in Queens!<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE at our dining events, we will dine <strong>FAMILY-STYLE<\/strong>, which means we order a variety of dishes and share them, together with sharing the final bill, together with tax and tips.

The Work is a simple yet powerful process of inquiry that teaches you to identify and question the thoughts that cause all the suffering in you and in the world. It\u2019s a way to understand what\u2019s hurting you, and to address the cause of your problems with clarity. In its most basic form, The Work consists of fours questions and the turnarounds. \u201cI discovered that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn't believe them, I didn't suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that. I found that suffering is optional. I found a joy within me that has never disappeared, not for a single moment. That joy is in everyone, always.\u201d \u2014Byron Katie People who do The Work as an ongoing practice commonly report: \u2022 Alleviation of depression: Find resolution, even happiness, in situations that were once debilitating. \u2022 Decreased stress: Live with less anxiety or fear. \u2022 Improved relationships: Experience deeper connection and intimacy with your partner, your parents, your children, your friends, and yourself. \u2022 Reduced anger: Understand what makes you angry and resentful and become reactive less often, with less intensity. \u2022 Increased mental clarity: Live and work more intelligently and effectively, with integrity. \u2022 More energy: Experience a new sense of ongoing vigor and well-being. \u2022 More peace: Discover how to become \u201ca lover of what is.\u201d Ben Henderson is an expert facilitator of The Work. This meetup will help you understand what The Work truly is, and how to use it in your life to dissolve or reduce any stressful thinking that arises in you, whether it be at work, with family, in you love relationships, with your friends, at school, wherever. For sure, I can promise you this, that the evening will be interesting, useful, and even funny at times. It's light and non-confrontational. You will think, really think, about your life in a totally new way without using force, belief or another sytem of thought. Rather, you will use this simple inquiry, gently and slowly, to come to your own answers and resolutions.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7056195,"name":"Ben"},"members":36,"name":"NEW YORK BYRON KATIE MEETUP","id":19059819,"state":"NY","urlname":"NEW-YORK-BYRON-KATIE-MEETUP","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Truth Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445796671000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"biracialwmn","name":"Biracial Women","id":3636},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"multicultural","name":"Multicultural","id":16368},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"interracial-relationships","name":"Interracial Relationships","id":25502},{"urlkey":"interracial-singles","name":"Interracial singles","id":25503},{"urlkey":"interracial-dating","name":"Interracial Dating","id":25504},{"urlkey":"african-american-women","name":"African American Women","id":27978},{"urlkey":"multiracial","name":"Multiracial","id":261021}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Hybrid-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In today' world, we see media and external forces tearing down the self-esteem, worth and beauty of women\/men of color.

It's why so many people come here.  \n\nBut usually what happens to us is that in time we stop feeling inspired to do our creative work.  We work hard at our \"day jobs\" thinking we will make time to do our creative work in our free time.  \n\nBut then that begins to peter out.  We are tired, anxious, resentful toward ourselves and the world, wish it could be better, and think,\"If only ...\":  If only I didn't have to work, if only people understood me, if only I weren't so lazy, if only I had more free time, if only my spouse or mate would support me more, if only I were better at what I do, if only I didn't have such a lousy boss ... if only, if only, if only.    \n\nThen it gets more and more complicated, and we get buried in our negative excuses and our inspiration vanishes.  The trick is : How do I keep that inpiration alive?\n\n First ask yourself these questions:\n\nDo you often start creative projects and then give up?\n\nDo you fear if people see or hear your creative work, they will reject it?\u00a0 They will reject you?\n\nIf someone criticizes your work, does it get you down?\n\nIf someone appreciates your creative work, do you think they are being insincere and just trying to flatter you?\n\nDo you tell yourself you don't have the time or energy to do your creative work?\n\nDo you hate being judged as an artist (\"artist\" includes all the arts here)?\n\nAre you your own harshest critic? \n\nDo you think being creative is just too darn hard and that you are not cut out for it?\n\nDo you think you are not talented enough to be successful, not as talented as others,  so why bother?\n\nDo you think you \"have too much going on\" to set aside time to do your creative work?\n\nDo you compare yourself to other creative artists and think you come up short?\n\nDo you yearn to be fully creative but think you just don't have it in you?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any one of these questions, this meetup is for you.  What this meetup teaches you is that all  you need really is insight, true, honest-with-yourself insight.  \n\nThis meetup offers two facets:\n\n1) Inquiry:  We use a powerful method of inquiry to  find the truth about our situation and with that, discover that it is not the situation we are in, but the way we look at it, that causes our stress.  With inquiry, we learn to reduce our negative thinking so that it does not stand in the way between us and having all the creativity in the world available to us.  We start to have that natural enthusiasm  back.  We stop being so self-hating and self-denying and we find the inspiration we need within ourselves.  All this takes is simple inquiry.  So in this part of the meetup we do not get answers from others or what others have read,  or what I know, but within ourselves.  Such insight LASTS.  Why? Because it is YOURS.  Furthermore, I will teach you this from of inquiry so that you can do it on your own, everyday if you wish!\n\nThe second part is the coaching.  Here is where you start to come up with an action plan aligned with your new insights.  This plan is YOURS.  It is not meant to be harsh, burdensome or obligatory.  It must be light and fun.  It must turn you on.  Usually artists lay too much on themselves.  They give themsleves a huge action plan and that becomes burdensome.  I coach you to keep it small,  keep it simple, and see what happens.  Baby steps.  Take baby steps.  Later you can take bigger steps, but I strongly steer people away from overwhelming themselves at the beginning or at any point in their process.  I coach you to stay away from the \"have-to's\" and stick with the \"love-to's.\"  I might make suggestions but I do not give advice.  What you don't need is someone telling you what to do.  You need to find the answers,that natural freedom within yourself and you cannot do that if someone is looking over your shoulder, so to speak.

This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I had basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen. The cost per guest is will be minimum donation of $40. As I said at the top, there\u2019s going to be delicious food, bottomless drinks, and music, all in a spacious apartment with a large terrace overlooking Central Park \u2013 perfect ingredients for a great time, especially when it\u2019s for a good cause!<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194679069,"name":"David Mazzucchi"},"members":26,"name":"Fundraising dinner for Haitian school","id":19063602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Haiti-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fundraisers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445890957000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"accounting","name":"Accounting","id":378},{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"small-business-accounting","name":"Small Business Accounting","id":27267}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Tax-Accounting-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group will aid small business owners, self-employed individuals and those looking to venture out onto their own in learning fundamental Finance, Accounting and Tax concepts with the aid of skilled designated professionals.

Or worse, the road is in sight, but it\u2019s a treacherous obstacle course that has no finish line.&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re facing this right now, I hold the utmost compassion for you from a place of having been there myself. And having been there I know that despite what you\u2019re living right now and how you\u2019re feeling in this moment, somewhere within you is a very strong <b>faith<\/b> that there is something better, a faster way, an easier way\u2026 a knowing that <b>change doesn't have to be so hard.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>After all, why should it be? Aren\u2019t you an extension of the higher power you believe in, a piece of what has made up this entire universe? As that, shouldn\u2019t you be able to mold your own universe, your own life, into whatever you choose? With as little struggle and as much fun as you would if you were placing an order and selecting what you wanted from a catalog?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yes you are, and yes you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The truth is <\/b>that the voice within you, the one that\u2019s always known and the one that\u2019s always guiding you - perhaps even to these words right now - is right. The road to whatever transformation you are in search of is an ACCELERATED one- or it can be given the right mentor and the right tools. From my heart to yours, I invite you to experience first-hand how accelerated the transformation that\u2019s been calling you can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>I decided to start this group<\/b> because as a master coach and successful entrepreneur, I notice so many people (including myself at one point in time) in what I call the \u201chamster wheel\u201d of never achieving their goals, where it seems to them that they never will or worse that their experience of getting there is such a struggle that they rob themselves from the joy of the process. It hurts me to see this as so many people's experience, just as much as it hurt me to experience it once myself... and it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The purpose of this meet up is <\/b>for you to discover and uncover what within you is truly holding you back and be given the tools on how to transform that in the most accelerated way. I'll be sharing a way for you to literally shift your existing reality to the one you desire - immediately. I'm sure you\u2019ve heard that many times before, but the difference this time is that I\u2019m not \"just saying this to you\"\u2026 I\u2019m <b>claiming<\/b> this <b>for you <\/b>and inviting you to claim this for yourself<b>.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What gives me the right<\/b> to claim that? Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve DONE with my own life and now it's what I so deeply want for yours. Earlier this year, it was my own voice within that guided me to receiving these tools from my mentor which ended up being THE biggest quantum shift of my life - I tell you, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is beating so fast with the truth that I do not even recognize myself! It is from this place that a fire within me exists to personally guide you to through your own experience of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The very tools that I was given to use for my own accelerated evolution are the very tools that you are being offered right now. I invite you to come find out what those are! Talk is cheap and your personal experience of what I\u2019m sharing with you is stronger than any of my words. Once you get to know me, you\u2019ll learn that I\u2019m not about the fluff, but rather the real \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d to arrive at the transformation you\u2019re looking for... and it's my greatest fulfillment to provide that for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Therefore, these meet-ups are FREE<\/b>\u2026 you have nothing to lose and more than you could ever imagine to gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>So, are you ready?
