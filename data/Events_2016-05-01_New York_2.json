In this talk I will briefly recap standard methods for visualizing social networks in R using packages such as <a href=\"http:\/\/igraph.org\/\">igraph<\/a> as well as transferring R data to other visualization tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/gephi.org\/\">Gephi<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/\">d3.js<\/a>. I will also give examples of some recently developed R packages and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.htmlwidgets.org\/\">htmlwidgets<\/a> such as <a href=\"https:\/\/christophergandrud.github.io\/networkD3\/\">networkD3<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/dataknowledge.github.io\/visNetwork\/\">visNetwork<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bwlewis\/rthreejs\">threejs<\/a> that provide user interactivity. Finally, I shall describe some ways in which the temporal dynamics of social networks can be captured.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About James:<\/b><\/p> <p>Professor James Curley is an Assistant Professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.columbia.edu\/cu\/psychology\/\">Psychology at Columbia University<\/a> and executive member of the Columbia Center for Integrative Animal Behavior.

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

No matter your stage of professional development, the wisdom and support of a more experienced advisor can prove invaluable.

Do you really need one? How can you find one that's right for you? How do you initiate that relationship? And what do you do once you've got one?<\/p> <p>In our Mentorship Roundtable, we'll discuss these questions and more from a variety of perspectives, from structured professional or academic mentorship programs to more informal ad-hoc relationships, hearing from both experienced mentors and those who have benefited from being on the other side.<\/p> <p>We'll also kick off a discussion about how best to support, encourage, and facilitate mentorship opportunities within our own communities and industries, connecting game developers right here in New York.

Old and young will enjoy learning how to use the songs creatively and how to include them in their daily routines. We invite non-German speakers to join in as well, and make sure that everyone can follow easily. The classes are age appropriately designed. They are infused with finger plays, dance segments and instrument exploration and provide a rich environment for music development, creativity and cognitive development. Learning a language through music is very effective. Rhythm and melody help the brain to memorize with ease. The latest research shows that music has a unique way in activating speech pathways.

In 1997 she founded Sol La Ti Music, and overlooks a staff of 3 teachers and supervises 3 locations. Ms. Tranchina holds a BFA in Education from JW Goethe University, Frankfurt. She came to New York to independently continue her studies in dance and voice. Gabi is a voice instructor certified level 3 in \u201cSomatic Voicework TM\u201d and a Certified Level 1 Music Together instructor. She also plays guitar and some piano. In 2012 some of her German families showed a strong desire for Gabi to offer a music class in German. She started German Music Together but the German families preferred the focus exclusively on German song material. Hence \u201cMusikalische M\u00e4use\u201d was born.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group\/events\/228921134\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":2700000,"name":"Musikalische M\u00e4use -FREE TRIAL","id":"228921134","time":1460039400000,"updated":1460043786000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1325706674000,"name":"CityKinder Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3044732,"urlname":"CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10605","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"White Plains","address_1":"280 Old Mamaroneck Road","name":"Temple Israel Center Nursery School","lon":-73.76284,"id":14232722,"state":"NY","lat":41.006504,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.3722515106,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458141518000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Connect with other parents of young babies while learning from this month's expert: Rabbi Ari Isenberg-Grzeda.<\/p> <p>Rabbi Ari is our new, young and very enthusiastic Rabbi. \u00a0He has lots of energy, is so wonderful with children and is approachable and\u00a0passionate. \u00a0Come learn about Jewish customs with him. \u00a0Discover new ways to celebrate holidays with your baby and family and ask\u00a0anything\u00a0you've ever wanted to know about Jewish parenting.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a FREE event. \u00a0Bagels and coffee will be served.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Pull to the back parking lot and enter in the Nursery School entrance.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Jewish-Babies-Toddlers\/events\/229636646\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Babies & Bagels: Celebrating Jewish Milestones 101","id":"229636646","time":1460040300000,"updated":1460045138000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372272274000,"name":"TIC Westchester Jewish Babies & Toddlers","group_lon":-73.75,"id":9104612,"urlname":"Westchester-Jewish-Babies-Toddlers","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"New York, NY","name":"John F.

By going with us, you agree to research the trip, and send the organizer or others questions as necessary. On the trail, we all care for each other as friends, not as guides or leaders or agents \u2013 if you sign up to come, you agree to take primary responsibility for yourself. There are no \u201cliability waivers\u201d or other written agreements to sign. By signing up you agree not to hold anyone responsible if something goes wrong for any reason.<\/p> <p><b>The Group Leads. The Organizer Organizes.<\/b><br\/>We do not have \"trip leaders.\" There is, however, always an organizer who gives out as much trip event information as possible and practicable on the website event post prior to an event. Nothing replaces the collective wisdom of the group, especially in the wilderness. We work hard to strengthen our post information and advice to ensure our trip groups are matched for our hikes and that everyone in the group is ready mentally or physically for the hike and that everyone has all relevant facts before the event. As a member you can do your part - read the post carefully prior to your attendance. If you have questions, suggestions or comments, email them to your organizer well beforehand.<\/p> <p><b>Hike Preparation<\/b><br\/>You are solely responsible for researching each event and for selecting and bringing appropriate gear and supplies, including clothing, food and water, to each event. If you have any questions regarding appropriate gear or supplies, please contact the event organizer for the event. You understand that any guidance given by an organizer is done as a courtesy based on the organizer's personal experience and physical capabilities, which may not be the same as yours, and will not hold any organizer liable for guidance provided. You remain responsible for you.<\/p> <p><b>Leave No Trace:<\/b><br\/>Outdoor skills and ethics - protect our hiking resources. <a href=\"https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn\/7-principles\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn<\/a>...<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Children:<\/b><br\/>Children are allowed on hikes or other events at the sole discretion of the event organizer as indicated in the event posting.

All pet owners must bring a leash along in case needed for the safety of all hikers, other pets, or your own pet. Pets must be leashed on the request of the event organizer. Pet owners are solely responsible for their pets and their actions. If you are afraid of dogs, and are attending a hike that permits dogs, please advise the hike organizer ASAP, so we can try to accommodate your needs.<\/p> <p><b>Event Updates:<\/b><br\/>By signing up to an event, you agree to check the event posting often for any updates to the event.<\/p> <p><b>Waits at Trail Junctions:<\/b><br\/>The group decides where and when to wait up for those behind - but no one joining us should always count on that. It's easy for trail junctions to be overlooked. By going with us, you agree to research the trip on your own, know where we are going and how to get back, even if for some unanticipated reason you may wind up having to do that by yourself.<\/p> <p><b>Hike Pace:<\/b><br\/>There is no set pace - you set your own. HYOH - Hike Your Own Hike.<\/p> <p>Any hike over 10 miles will not be done as a large group hike, we will leave the parking area together but then split apart as our pace allows us to do so. All hikers are encouraged to hike at a pace they are comfortable with. Please make sure you know the route and can make it out alone if needed. If you have concerns please see the organizer before the hike starts. The organizer will wait at the end of the hike to make sure all hikers complete the hike safely.<\/p> <p><b>Attendance and Lateness Policy:<\/b><br\/>Be on time. At the discretion of the organizer, we may wait 15 minutes only for late attendees that have already signed up for an event.<\/p> <p><b>Group Size:<\/b><br\/>The group size will be determined based on the hike and the rules of the land we will be hiking on.

In the\u00a0middle of that awesome visualization I felt a burst, a huge leap of energy expanding in my heart chakra (and since I am an energy healer it makes so much sense). Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears. I can feel at ease knowing I have this new tool in my hands, it's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and\u00a0I wanted to first thank you for hosting this. I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I love how you said to write down all your thoughts\/ lists about yourself, as well as goals, to see where the conflicts lie. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"I met Ayelet at a free Lust to Love Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>Ayelet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron\">www.Facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron<\/a>) is a relationship expert. I asked for her advice regarding my recent breakup with my boyfriend of six years, which is why I went to her event. Ayelet explained that we have a tendency to constantly chase guys who don't treat us right, and we have expectations of other people that in turn, create unhappiness in our lives. Working on the root chakra helps us let go of those expectations and find inner peace.<\/p> <p>The meditation event helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships. The free meditation she led was life changing for me.\"- Annie Yang, NYC<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Email AyeletCoach@gmail.com saying \"attending free webinar\" to receive access","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Life-Transformers\/events\/229807416\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":2700000,"name":"A Webinar on Manifesting Abundance","id":"lsxwqlyvfbnc","time":1460052000000,"updated":1460056065000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337054153000,"name":"Transform Your Life: ATTRACT Goals, Relationships, SUCCESS","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3867642,"urlname":"The-Life-Transformers","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"The Life Transformers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Polarity Holdings Offices ","name":"Virtual Meeting","lon":-74.005943,"id":24470803,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459904094000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This virtual webinar will introduce entrepreneurial minded and non-technical individuals to cutting-edge \u201ctechnopreneur\u201d concepts (the blending of technology and entrepreneurship) that will ultimately enable them to:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0conceive, launch and scale technology driven startups<br\/>\u2022 become a web developer \/ build a web development business<br\/>\u2022 become mobile app developer \/ build a mobile app development business<br\/>\u2022 become a growth hacker \/ build a growth hacking agency<\/p> <p>attendees will be emailed a link to the virtual meeting room upon registration--\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/linked\/events\/230159235\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Code & Grow Rich | Become A Technopreneur ","id":"230159235","time":1460052000000,"updated":1460063766000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1386282211000,"name":"Entrepreneur, Technology, Marketing, Sales & Startup Network","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":11356872,"urlname":"linked","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"business virtuosos"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459912679000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Whether you're a solopreneur, small business, or non-profit, you need an effective marketing plan to hit your goals.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

In fact, Disrupt talks have been given and attended by C-Suite Leaders, Technologists, Restaurateurs, Students, Politicians...and, yes, even a few HR Professionals.<\/p> <p>Thursday, April 7th, 2016 | 5:30-9:00pm<br\/>Arrive and network 5:30-6:30pm<br\/>Speakers start promptly at 6:30pm\u00a0<br\/>Break around 7:15pm\u00a0<br\/>More speakers and we're done by 9:00pm!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.disrupthr.co\/newyork","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DisruptHR-NYC\/events\/230152246\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":12600000,"name":"DisruptHR New York April","id":"230152246","time":1460064600000,"updated":1460078917000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441288306000,"name":"DisruptHR NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18895577,"urlname":"DisruptHR-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Disrupters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07102","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newark","address_1":"165 Mulberry St","lon":-74.170085,"phone":"973-757-6000","name":"Prudential Center","id":724417,"state":"NJ","lat":40.733351,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.51662540436,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457401252000,"fee":{"amount":31,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>TailDating Night at New Jersey\u00a0 Devils Hockey game vs. Tampa Bay Lightning<\/p> <p>Prudential Center, Newark NJ<\/p> <p>Thursday April 7th.\u00a0<br\/>Exclusive Party starts 5:30 pm.<\/p> <p>Game at 7:00 pm<\/p> <p>Tickets include $10 Food and beverage credit<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring a friend along and make new friends!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/oss.ticketmaster.com\/aps\/devils\/EN\/promotion\/home\">Use Promo Code: TDDevils<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TailDating-New-York\/events\/229425429\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Singles Night at NJ Devils game","id":"229425429","time":1460064600000,"updated":1460077406000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444077840000,"name":"TailDating New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18999102,"urlname":"TailDating-New-York","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Taildaters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":22.7179489136,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455840088000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Now with 50% more Brothers Aurora.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/230043794\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"Timmy and the Lords of the Underdark","id":"rjlqqlyvgbkb","time":1460066400000,"updated":1460081766000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Lexington Ave and 53 Street","lon":-73.97098,"phone":"(917) 609-9144","name":"Citigroup Center's Atrium","id":289538,"state":"NY","lat":40.758366,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.15319371223,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459871277000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>How have the Virtual Console releases treated you?

Preview talks scheduled for PyCon Italy and provide feedback to the speakers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Talks:<\/p> <p><b>Python is not Java - Offer Sharabi<\/b><\/p> <p>Developers with a Java background are often interested in learning Python as another language or sometimes are required to do so as part of a new job\/project they are working on.<\/p> <p>However, in many cases, they end up translating their knowledge too literally, writing \u2018Java in Python\u2019 where the resultant code feels clunky and is deemed non-\u2018Pythonic\u2019. Yet, it is not always obvious what is lost in translation and how one can utilise their previous knowledge in the new domain.<\/p> <p>Moreover, most of the literature in the area either compares between the features of the languages or provides low level mappings of data structures and data types. While both are valuable, none of those listings provide tools on how to harness previous knowledge or insights into why certain translations succeed and others fail.<\/p> <p>Motivated by code examples, this talk aims to bridge that gap between the languages. It focuses on common design patterns in Java and looks not only at their anti-pattern counterparts in Python, but importantly also at the Python patterns that can be used to better effect instead. As such, the aim of the presentation is to offer the Junior to Intermediate developer in Python a range of tools that can be utilised to successfully translate current knowledge in the previous language to their new one.<\/p> <p>About Offer: Worked as a developer for over 5 years now, coming from a research scientist background. Switched to program in Python from Java more than a year ago, as part of a new job. I use python for small scripts as well as for full commercial application with low latency and high throughput. In the latter we use python 2.x with PyPy for high performance. I also encounter python in other tools such as Ansible, Fabric and PySpark. This will be my first time presenting in a conference, although I have presented internally in my company and in several MeetUps.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Introduction to JSON Schema - Julian Berman<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>JSON Schema (<a href=\"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/json-schema.org\/<\/a>) is an increasingly popular, cross-language specification for schematization of JSON documents.

You may complain about not having enough. Or about ending up in \u201cthe friend zone\u201d. Or about how unfair it is that women have the all the power and don\u2019t give you the sex you want. You may have even \u201cgiven up\u201d, and decided to stop trying to have sex, hoping that one day a woman will come along and decide you\u2019re the one she wants. In the meantime, you seek other outlets like porn, strip clubs, and prostitution, and end up feeling empty, shameful and lonely.<\/p> <p><br\/>There\u2019s GOOD NEWS! What if I told you women want sex more than men? That they're hungry for it and have sexual scarcity too? What if women are regularly telling you that they\u2019re interested in you, and you just aren\u2019t able to hear them?<\/p> <p>It\u2019s like if a really amazing, turned on Japanese woman comes up to you, and starts telling you in Japanese that she\u2019s attracted to you and wanted to go on a date. You don\u2019t speak Japanese, so by the 4th or 5th time you tell her that you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, eventually she\u2019ll get tired and go away.<\/p> <p>IT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY! You can move from scarcity to abundance, you CAN have the sex you want.<\/p> <p>Keith Paolino knows this pattern well. For the decade before he showed up to OneTaste, he was emotionally stunted and had been celibate for years. Then he started an Orgasmic Meditation practice, got turned on, and powerful women started giving him reflections and adjustments. Now he has manifested an abundance of sex and intimacy most men don't dream is even possible. These days, he\u2019s a successful sex and relationship coach with OneTaste Austin, and loves to give to other men what turned on women have given to him.<\/p> <p>Come see how you might be talking yourself out of sex and connection. And take your next step towards abundance.<\/p> <p>OneTaste teaches about relationships, intimacy, sexuality and purpose through a practice called Orgasmic Meditation. Orgasmic Meditation is a partnered consciousness practice where a man or woman strokes the upper left-hand quadrant of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes in order to increase connection, sensitivity, and intimacy. Admission is FREE.<\/p> <p>This event is open to all adults 18 years or older.

Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/229774345\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Each Thurs. from 7-9pm  Happiness and Goodness at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"krgdllyvgbkb","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460115310000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10009","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"10009","address_1":"E 6 ST & FDR DR","name":"East River Park Track","lon":-73.974739,"id":14312322,"state":"NY","lat":40.721565,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.12535595894,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458245437000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The East River Park track is east of the FDR at East 6th Street.

Mary is a beautiful yet ordinary teenager who vows to maintain her chastity. Following a warning from an angel, a confused and innocent Mary unexpectedly falls pregnant and is forced to wed her taxi-driving boyfriend Joseph. He, in turn, must love his virgin bride from a distance, revering her without touching her. Forced to face a shocking reality, Mary and Joseph along with their family and friends must struggle to cope as the provocative theme unfolds. Hail Mary is a sensational and bold work from French master director Jean-Luc Godard which touched off an uproar of protest heard around the world.<\/p> <p>See more upcoming French events at <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1M3VDzs\">fluentcity.com\/events<\/a>.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Just come on back when you arrive!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Williamsburg-French-Language-Meetup-Group\/events\/230026067\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"French Film Night Hosted by Fluent City","id":"230026067","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460081956000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1281014308000,"name":"Williamsburg French Language Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1686219,"urlname":"Williamsburg-French-Language-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":1.73755836487,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458230437000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":1},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will go over three writers work of ten pages double spaced. \u00a0We have a slot for one reader and a stand-by. \u00a0I am announcing this early as Spring is temping us all.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/writers-652\/events\/229666649\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"Workshop 3 manuscripts","id":"229666649","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460083623000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1176254522000,"name":"The NYC Fiction Writers Workshop Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":473114,"urlname":"writers-652","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Writers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10601","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"White Plains","address_1":"30 Mamaroneck Ave","lon":-73.766627,"phone":"914-993-6358","name":"The Melting Pot","id":760658,"state":"NY","lat":41.031707,"repinned":false},"headcount":28,"distance":22.7391662598,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459278848000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The feedback was excellent from our last event at <i>The Melting Pot<\/i>. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>And everyone enjoyed all they put out for us.

This is your opportunity show your 3D prints, designs and project ideas! If you have something to share please feel free to participate or just come to observe what our group members have been interested in with 3D printing.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p><b>3D Thursdays!<\/b><\/p> <p>So... there has been a lot of fuss about this desktop 3D printing revolution thing for a while now. Still very exciting! \u00a0<\/p> <p>We have a new-old idea that leaps beyond the news hype and celebrates the wonder of the activity itself. Let's get together every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations. And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=224+West+4th+street%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10014%2C+us","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/229329729\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":9000000,"name":"3D Thursdays! : 3D Printing Show and Tell","id":"kggzmlyvgbkb","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460080457000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364936758000,"name":"fat cat FAB LAB","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":7890972,"urlname":"fat-cat-fab-lab","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"White Plains","address_1":"120 Bloomingdale Rd 1st Floor","name":"Keller Williams Realty","lon":-73.758476,"id":24383888,"state":"NY","lat":41.027023,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.6868724823,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457355085000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you've got a Chromebook, bring it.

The Project Speakers prepare their speeches according to the project assignment.<\/p> <p>b).\u00a0 The second part of the meeting is Table Topics, which are brief impromptu speeches that require no preparation. \u00a0There are\u00a0two purposes during this part. \u00a0The first purpose is to provide a speaking opportunity to members and prospective members who do not have a speaking role.\u00a0The second purpose is to improve our impromptu speaking skills.<\/p> <p>c).\u00a0 The third and final part of the meeting is the Evaluation portion.\u00a0Evaluation is an important part of a Toastmasters meeting. Unless we receive feedback on our speeches to know what our strengths and weaknesses are, we will not improve our communication and listening skills.<\/p> <p>In the club meeting, you practice giving prepared speeches as well as brief impromptu presentations (Table Topics). There is no rush and no pressure: The Toastmasters program allows you to progress at your own pace.<\/p> <p>Constructive evaluation is central to the Toastmasters philosophy. Receiving - and giving - such feedback is a great learning experience. In Toastmasters, encouragement and improvement go hand-in-hand.<\/p> <p>Toastmasters is a place where you develop and grow - both personally and professionally. You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations. You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Floral-Park-Toastmasters-Club\/events\/230007274\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"General Toastmasters Club Meeting","id":"230007274","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460158517000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452653266000,"name":"Floral Park Toastmasters Club","group_lon":-73.7099990845,"id":19330309,"urlname":"Floral-Park-Toastmasters-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Ridgefield","address_1":"734 Grand Ave","name":"PEAK Performing Arts Center (Formerly The Viibe Dance Center)","lon":-74.00683,"id":23961380,"lat":40.8413,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.38228368759,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445529621000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/e\/c\/600_443265548.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are going to meet up to learn a bit of Dominican style Bachata, its rhythm and culture @ 7pm. \u00a0@ 8pm we continue with salsa salsa salsa.

Master Level Social Worker\u00a0<\/p> <p>I worked with various populations and along with a multitude of problems including but not limited to mental illness, alcohol, and drug addiction, homelessness and a host of medical illnesses including hospice care. However in the midst of the depression and despair I recognized one common thread that everyone seemed stuck in the situation with little hope of getting out of the situation until the situation resolved itself.\u00a0<br\/>I decided to become a Dream Builder Life Coach taught by Mary Morrissey.\u00a0<br\/>The basis behind my coaching is just what would you love in your life that you do not have and cannot understand how to get it. If money, education, time, and age had no barrier, what would you love! Life can change in an instant and most of us are stuck and do not even realize it but we no longer had the excitement about life that we once had.\u00a0<br\/>In Class, all attendees must bring pen and paper. Collectively all will write down their dreams in four areas:\u00a0<br\/>1-Relationships\u00a0<br\/>2-Health and Well Being\u00a0<br\/>3-Vocation\u00a0<br\/>4-Time and Money\u00a0<br\/>Then I will ask 5 questions that I would read over after one has written down\u00a0<br\/>their dreams, these are basic questions to see if their dreams aligns with their core values. This builds excitement. I help people is to realize their dreams in a short period of time. Not only do I help people find their inner dreams that are starving to come out; I help them realize that they DESERVE their dreams! In a short period of time, I can help you find your dreams.\u00a0<br\/>Reality is that most people have dreams but get lost in the everyday life. I help you become aware of what is holding you back from making your dreams a reality. Depression is really the separation of ones\u2019 dreams. Instead of taking medication to numb our feelings and discontent lets follow this holistic approach to happiness and excitement!\u00a0<br\/>Let\u2019s follow our dreams!\u00a0<br\/>--------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad-----------How to Heal Suppressed Wounds Through Inner Child Work and\u00a0<br\/>Past Life Regression\u00a0<br\/>Kelly Tallaksen, Board Certificate Hypnotist and Past Life Regressionist\u00a0<br\/>Specializing in inner child bonding and healing of the soul\u00a0<\/p> <p>Learn:\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 Why the subconscious mind suppresses emotions\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 Why awareness of unconscious pain is the only way to heal it\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 How loving your younger self liberates your adult self\u00a0<br\/>\u2022 Do we really have past lives and how does past life regression work heal soul?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Kelly Tallaksen is a board certified hypnotist, past life regression practitioner and instructor, holds a certificate in Holistic Psychology, specializes in 5 Phase Advanced Transformational Hypnosis, Parts Therapy and is the creator of the LUV Your Feelings Process.

One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time-from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains-this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.<\/p> <p>Novels at Night is a book club for adults 21 years and older who enjoy reading and sharing their opinions about books. Join us monthly at the 9 Iron Grille (314 Paramus Road) to meet new people, sample great food** and drinks, and discuss books in a relaxed atmosphere.

Users subscribe to mediabistro\u2019s many services, which include online education,employment classifieds, conferences (offline), events (offline), forums, and industry-specific blogs, such as the popular TVNewser. Following the sale of the company for $23 mm to Jupitermedia, Laurel remained with the company through June, 2011.<\/p> <p>Laurel began investing in seed-stage startups, including: AdYapper, Appboy, Apploi, Buddie, Clef, CreativeWorx, Fashion GPS, Learn Immersive and Pivit.

The hand made prints were created by carving huge Italian slate blackboards, and reproducing on fabric and rice paper- without a printing press.<\/p> <p><br\/>Five of Kent\u2019s monumental wooden sculptures are also on display with content that reflects everyday items such as a hammer, shoe, key, shoehorn, and a crushed beer can. The rich illustrious hand carvings complement 32 prints in the second in a series of shows at New England\u2019s diverse Six Summit Gallery<\/p> <p><br\/>Kent, who many consider one of America\u2019s greatest printmakers and sculptors, lived as a recluse. His work was included alongside such titans as Jasper Johns, Robert Motherwell, and Phillip Guston. He attended Yale University, was the first curator of the John Slade Ely House, and exhibited at some the<\/p> <p><br\/>finest museums and galleries including-<\/p> <p><br\/>The Wadsworth Atheneum, Sundsvall Sweden, Colgate, Brooklyn Museum,<\/p> <p><br\/>Whitney Museum of American Art,\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>New Britain Museum of American Art and more. His work is in the collections of Smithsonian, Brooklyn Museum, Princeton University,<\/p> <p><br\/>New Britain Museum of American Art, Lyman Allen Art Museum, Yale University Art Gallery, Florence Griswold and many more.<\/p> <p><br\/>Private viewings and receptions available.

Devoting an extended length of time to developing tranquility and mindful awareness is an excellent way to stabilize the mind by means of careful attention to our bodies. This weekend retreat offers us the opportunity to do just that, with several periods of sitting meditation, walking meditation, and yoga, all intended to aid us in reestablishing a firm connection with our physical experience. The main teacher for the event is Bhante Suddh\u0101so, a local Buddhist monk, who will guide us in the process of taming our restless minds and regaining a sense of presence and attentive serenity.<\/p> <p>INFO:<br\/>Vegetarian meals will be served using organic ingredients and featuring desserts made locally by The Paleo Factory.

He is a post-doc research scientist with David Blei's lab at Columbia.<\/p> <p>Abstract:\u00a0Machine learning is changing the way we analyze data. We want to study large datasets to shed light on complicated processes. (How do proteins function? How do people navigate a city?) To this end, we need tools to rapidly and iteratively explore hidden patterns in data. However, using machine learning to discover such patterns requires enormous effort and cross-disciplinary expertise.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this talk, Alp will present strategies to automate tedious machine learning computations. He will show how we can design one algorithm to work for many problems and gain new insights from large datasets.<\/p> <p>Bio:\u00a0Alp is a postdoctoral research scientist at the Data Science Institute and the<br\/>department of Computer Science at Columbia University.

Whether it's in a shared workspace or a vast network of connections, innovation requires community. At a place like the Centre for Social Innovation, shared space forms the bedrock of our model. Being physically together is what sets the conditions for new relationships, new projects, and unexpected outcomes. But sometimes that's not enough. Being in the same space does not automatically spark connection and collaboration.<br\/>When the community of innovators is diverse and vast, how can they optimize their ability to learn about each other, work together, and ultimately, make impact and effect change? How can technology foster an even deeper level of community between a network of innovators and changemakers?<br\/>Hackathons are coding competitions, where individuals and teams build mobile apps from scratch over a 24 hour period. The apps are then pitched to judges and prizes award for the best apps. Hackathons are a great opportunity to learn new technologies, network with fellow developers, enjoy some food, most importantly have some fun!<\/p> <p><b>Your Mission...<\/b><br\/>To hack collaboration to transform the ways groups connect in a shared space, ultimately increasing productive and collective collaboration.<\/p> <p><b>You Bring...<\/b><br\/>Your laptop, skills &amp; ideas.

After a busy and dry month of March which is way too long to have a meet up, I figured that we should have a meet up in April and drink twice as much. For this meetup we will be going to two different locations.<\/p> <p>Place number 1: Beer Authority. This bar is located in the busy section of Midtown Manhattan right next to port authority, I wonder if that has something to do with the name? This bar boasts an impressive 73 beer tap list, as well as 87 bottles! They also have a few ciders for those who can't really drink beer. Now you can't beat that. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beerauthoritynyc.com\/home\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.beerauthoritynyc.com\/home\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.beerauthoritynyc.com\/home<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Place number 2: District Tap house. This holds a special place in my heart, as this was the first place I held my meet up. This bar is also located in Midtown Manhattan. They boast 50 beers on tap, and 72 bottles! In that list also contains a few ciders. This place also makes a real good cocktail and one of the best burgers, don't believe me ask the shift leader about it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.districttaphouse.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.districttaphouse.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.districttaphouse.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Both places are about a 5 minute walk from each other, which makes it easy for the group to walk or stumble to the next location. Pending after hours there's a third secret spot that we can go to, just don't tell nobody.<\/p> <p>As this is a Friday Night meet up in Midtown Manhattan, I can't control the crowd or space issues in the bars. As I have seen with this group we always make do of what we have.<\/p> <p>Come one, come all. If this is your first meet up we are happy to meet you.

Amid concerns about institutionalized racism, the gap between the rich and poor, religious intolerance, and gender inequality, people are angry and confused.<\/p> <p>Around 2500 years ago, the Buddha was considered a social revolutionary, questioning the rigid caste system that fixed people's roles in society. Could the Buddha's message offer any solutions today with respect to social injustice?How does individual spiritual development contribute to society and the greater good?\u00a0How is it possible to cultivate love and compassion in reaction to hatred and anger?<\/p> <p>Professor Jan Willis shares her perspectives while recounting her own journey. Growing up in segregated Alabama, she endured a burning cross on her family's lawn and police dogs during the Birmingham Campaign led by Martin Luther King Jr.\u00a0She considered joining the Black Panthers but instead chose a Buddhist path, where she met Lama Thubten Yeshe and followed the way of meditation, unconditional love, and higher education, eventually becoming a scholar of Indic and Buddhist studies.\u00a0Professor Willis will share with us how Buddhism impacted her views about herself, social justice, and the role of personal healing in an angry and unjust society.<\/p> <p><b>Weekend Teachings: Being a Bodhisattva in the Modern World\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Saturday\u00a0&amp; Sunday, April 9-10 from\u00a010am to 5pm\u00a0<\/p> <p>In these weekend teachings, Professor Jan Willis will discuss how to apply the traditional Buddhist teachings on bodhichitta to life in our modern world. What does it mean to be a bodhisattva today? How can we live this ideal in our daily lives? How can we contribute to a better world while growing our compassion and wisdom?\u00a0She will especially focus on Shantideva's\u00a0<i>Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life<\/i>. How can we recognize and transform our biases to enact the principle regularly taught by His Holiness the Dalai Lama -- that all beings are exactly the same in that they don't want to suffer and all want happiness? What does it mean to exchange oneself with others? \u00a0<\/p> <p>Professor Willis teaches in a lively way. Her teachings will also include discussions and meditations.

There are fantastic restaurants, nightclubs, antique shops, pubs, street fairs, and lots of special events in our little river village bustling with tourism. Parking can be challenging. Elmwood Playhouse, like most businesses in Nyack, does not have on-site parking. On weekends, we recommend you get to the theatre at least 30 minutes early to find parking. Be aware of parking signs and regulations as they will ticket, and nothing can ruin a good mood like a $25.00 parking fine. Best Bet: municipal parking lot on Main St, across from Park St.\u00a0<\/i><i><\/p> <p>You do not need to leave a performance to feed the meters.<\/i><i><br\/>The meters can be pre-fed earlier in the evening and will go into effect at eleven.<\/i><i>This means that if you put in .75c in the machine you will get a receipt reflecting 12 midnight, the hour you just bought. Cool.<\/p> <p>Parking meters are in effect from 11:00 am until 6:00 pm.<br\/>They go back into effect at 11:00 pm until 6:00 am.<br\/>Evening meters will allow for pre-purchase of up to eight hours of parking in advance.

The first leg is from Mount Peter in Warwick to Arden (roughly 11 miles) and is scheduled on 3\/12 (Sat). The second leg is from Arden to Jones Point (roughly 18 miles) and is scheduled on 4\/9 (Sat). This hike is not designed for the beginners who have never navigated themselves in the woods using maps and a compass or GPS. All the participants are expected to be independent and self-sufficient, as the group will walk at his or her own pace without a sweep. The group will meet at the Shortline ticket counter at 8:10 and take the 8:30 bus to Arden. The bus is scheduled to arrive at Arden at 9:26, and the hike will begin shortly thereafter. We aim to finish up the hike by 17:00, which would give us 7.5 hours to hike 18 miles (= 2.4 miles\/hour in average including breaks).
