Not far from Paris. It is party day at Marguerite Dumont\u2019s castle. Like every year, an array of music lovers gathers around a great cause at the owner\u2019s place. Nobody knows much about this woman except that she is rich and that her whole life is devoted to her passion: music. Marguerite sings. She sings wholeheartedly, but she sings terribly out of tune. In ways quite similar to the Castafiore, Marguerite has been living her passion in her own bubble, and the hypocrite audience, always coming in for a good laugh, acts as if she was the diva she believes she is. When a young, provocative journalist decides to write a rave article on her latest performance, Marguerite starts to believe even further in her talent. This gives her the courage she needs to follow her dream. Despite her husband\u2019s reluctance, and with the help of a has\u2010been divo, both funny and mean, she decides to train for her first recital in front of a crowd of complete strangers.<\/p> <p><b>Cast:<\/b>\u00a0CATHERINE FROT, ANDR\u00c9 MARCON, MICHEL FAU, CHRISTA TH\u00c9RET, DENIS MPUNGA, SYLVAIN DIEUAIDE, AUBERT FENOY, SOPHIA LEBOUTTE, TH\u00c9O CHOLBI<\/p> <p><b>Website:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/cohenmedia.net\/films\/marguerite\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cohenmedia.net\/films\/marguerite\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cohenmedia.net\/films\/marguerite<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/baltimorebookclub\/events\/229613773\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Free Movie - Marguerite","id":"229613773","time":1458169200000,"updated":1458181609000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1073244676000,"name":"The Baltimore Book Club Meetup Group","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":23296,"urlname":"baltimorebookclub","group_lat":39.2999992371,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"3602 Hickory Ave","name":"Gallery 788","lon":-76.633827,"id":24032924,"lat":39.331211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.94768118858,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457453467000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Drum circle and drum lesson.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

As a German Chancellor Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in[masked], she was hosted at the largest German Institute of Bee Research and traveled over 55,000 miles by car to meet with honey bee scientists and bee breeders throughout Western Europe, publishing 50+ articles in bee journals. Upon her return, she enrolled in graduate school and earned her PhD in honey bee biology with Dr. Robert Page from Arizona State University. Her research focused on how pheromones influence colony dynamics, pollen foraging, and honey bee physiology. She joined Dr. Dennis vanEngelsdorp\u2019s lab as a post-doc in 2014. Her research investigates the impacts of disease and pesticides on honey bee health. Dr. Traynor has forthcoming papers in the <i>Journal of Apicultural Research <\/i>and <i>Apidologie<\/i>, along with three more in submission on pesticides and honey bee health. In addition, she has just received two years of post-doctoral funding for improving honey bee nutrition from the USDA. Recently Kirsten was appointed as editor of <i>Bee World<\/i>, the International Bee Research Association\u2019s beekeeping magazine. With her husband, she authored a new book <i>Simple, Smart Beekeeping<\/i>, an illustrated guide that walks you through keeping healthy honey bee hives.

The Wedding Singer (May 26-June 19)<\/b><\/p> <p>The year is 1985. The hair is big, greed is good, and collars are up. Rock-star wannabe Robbie Hart is New Jersey's favorite wedding singer and the life of the party\u2014until his own fianc\u00e9e leaves him at the altar. Shot through the heart, Robbie makes every wedding as disastrous as his own. Enter Julia, a winsome waitress who wins his affection but is about to be married to a Wall Street shark. Unless Robbie can change his tune and pull off the performance of the decade, the girl of his dreams will be gone forever.<\/p> <p>Based on the hit New Line Cinema film starring Adam Sandler, The Wedding Singer's hilarious book (by Chad Beguelin and Tim Herlihy) and sparkling new score (music by Matthew Sklar, lyrics by Chad Beguelin) do for the '80s what Hairspray did for the '60s. Plus, 2016 marks the 10th anniversary of the show\u2019s 2006 Broadway premiere. So \u201cJust say yes!\u201d and don\u2019t miss this high-energy, romantic musical comedy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/f\/1\/600_446482513.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>2. Rent (June 30th - July 23rd)<\/b><\/p> <p>Exuberant, passionate, and joyous, Rent is theatre at its best. On the 20th anniversary of its Broadway premiere, we\u2019re excited to present this groundbreaking musical about falling in love, finding your voice, and living for today.<\/p> <p>Based loosely on Puccini's La Boheme and set in the East Village of New York City, Rent follows one year in the life of a group of impoverished young artists. Struggling to survive and create under the shadows of addiction, poverty, and HIV\/AIDS, these young bohemians negotiate their dreams, loves, and conflicts through rocking songs and a gripping story. With a book, music, and lyrics by the late Jonathan Larson, Rent is a pop culture phenomenon that won the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It also contains mature thematic material involving drugs and sexuality, and some language. Parental discretion is advised.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/f\/c\/600_446482524.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>3. The Producers (Aug 4th - Sep 4th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Bialystock and Bloom! Those names should strike hysteria in anyone familiar with Mel Brooks' classic cult comedy film. In 2001, The Producers premiered on Broadway and once again set the standard for modern, outrageous, in-your-face humor, winning a record 12 Tony Awards. ASGT caps off our 50th anniversary year with this modern classic, celebrating its 15th anniversary in 2016.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The plan is simple: a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer and his mild-mannered accountant scheme to produce the most notorious flop in Broadway history, thereby bilking their backers out of millions of dollars. But one thing goes awry: their show (the outrageously offensive \u201cSpringtime for Hitler\u201d) is a smash hit! At the core of this insanely funny adventure is a poignant journey of two very different men who become unlikely friends. With a truly hysterical book co-written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan (Annie) and music and lyrics by Mr. Brooks, The Producers takes no prisoners, as it proudly proclaims itself an \"equal opportunity offender!\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/0\/5\/600_446482533.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/8\/0\/600_446482912.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/228542480\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"LAST CHANCE!

It doesn't pay to be early...The park gate does not open until 9am. When you get to the gate tell them you are there for the MORE trail day and they should let you in for free! What: Build a trail from 9am to 1pm.<\/p> <p>Do we go home after 1pm? You can, but lunch and beverages are always provided....<\/p> <p>Now, do yourself a favor and bring water with you, as you will be hiking in a mile or so, and there is no place to refill while you work, and I can guarantee you will work up a sweat. Other than that, wear some comfortable shoes and stuff you would do normal yard work in. Finally, have fun with everyone else that is there!<\/p> <p>For this trail day, you will enter the main Avalon Entrance, and go all the way back to the swinging bridge and once there someone will direct you where to park.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park.

And sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by the subjects partner.<\/p> <p>As growing photographers, what's erotic and how to capture that look is subjective. But as always keep the end user's (you or the clients) opinion the highest weight in that balance.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this workshop our goal is to provoke emotions and thought with \"Subject, Composition, Light, and Exposure\" for that wonderful shot. With all good results planning is needed to increase our shot success ratio. Many items make up a good image and it all starts with good communication, spiritually within the artist (don't shoot until you see it) and verbally with your subject. We will have two returning models, Mina, Rebecca, and other DMV models as needed. There will be one model per two shooters.\u00a0(And if more women sign up we will include male models.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will create the scene, but the focus will be on \"parts\" of the model in the scene. (Again composition is key!) In some \"parts\" assignments photographers work with known viewers fetishes to bring out and provoke emotion for the art viewer; legs, shoes, hands, garters, handcuffs, rope, and so on. Some of these scenes will be done in our studio and outside to help give the final image the look and feel you were looking for. Then we will move into full scene story telling views.<\/p> <p>So, here is another workshop opportunity to broaden your shooting selections while you work on becoming one with your creative balance.

Meatout is a yearly campaign whose aim is to raise awareness of the many benefits of eating plant foods and encourage people to go veg for an entire day.

Also, the venue is being provided to us on a donation basis so it would be much appreciated if we could all pitch in a dollar or two towards the space.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/229648423\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvfbdc","time":1458682200000,"updated":1458701468000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules of this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides, is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aviationvelo.com\/\">Aviation Velo <\/a>(local bike shop in Linthicum) for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

If after the event starts we have not reached 20 players we will welcome walk-ins.

We follow the \"2 games in\" rule, in which the team that makes steps on the court plays 2 consecutive games, winning or loosing.

Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt.

And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Brio Tuscan Grille at Annapolis Town Centre is well-rated on Yelp for being a vibrant restaurant with tasty food and an open bar area. Our SHR group had a good time there last year. Happy hour runs from 3:30-6:30 pm. Ample free parking is available at the Town Centre garages. A large Whole Foods and several other chain stores are nearby if you want to do some shopping.<\/p> <p>Full details, directions, and reviews of Brio Tuscan Grille below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/brio-tuscan-grille-annapolis#query:brio%20tuscan%20grill\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/brio-tuscan-grille-annapolis#query:brio%20tuscan%20grill\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/brio-tuscan-grille-annapolis#query:brio%20tuscan%20grill<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/brioitalian.com\/annapolis_towne_centre.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/brioitalian.com\/annapolis_towne_centre.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/brioitalian.com\/annapolis_towne_centre.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:00 pm to find a good spot at the bar.

Semple, a former writer on shows like <i>Arrested Development<\/i> and <i>Mad About You<\/i> brings her riotously funny voice to not just Bernadette but a host of characters. Written as a series of emails, letters, and various other printed missives (including an emergency room bill!) <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette<\/i> follows Bernadette's life in Seattle\u2014until she mysteriously leaves behind her family, including her teenage daughter who has to track her down.<\/p> <p>From the publisher: \u201cBernadette Fox is notorious. To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friend and, simply, Mom.<br\/>Then Bernadette disappears. It began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle\u2014and people in general\u2014has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.<br\/>To find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, secret correspondence\u2014creating a compulsively readable and touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world.\u201d<\/p> <p>Our discussion will be held at Seasons 52 at the Mall in Columbia starting at 6pm. There are sometimes a couple book club groups that meet at the same time, so make sure to mention Lauren's name to the hostess. Come hungry (and thirsty, it is a Speakeasy after all!) and ready to discuss--but if you haven't read the book yet no worries! Please still feel free to come and meet our group members. Copies of <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette <\/i>will be available for pickup at the Central Branch's Fiction Desk a month before the discussion date.

There are lots of things we can do in Maryland to help Bernie win here at home.<\/p> <p><br\/>This will be a great opportunity to learn how to canvass locally with the campaign, as well as a chance to meet other Bernie supporters from our community.<\/p> <p><br\/>Maryland's Primary is April 26th and campaign staff will outline how we can take this state for Bernie. Please join us for this meeting as we ramp up efforts in Howard County and share ideas.<\/p> <p><br\/>Note: This event will take place in the Oella Room.

The evening\u2019s composers include Robert Schumann, one of the greatest of the Romantic Period, Hugo Wolf, Hector Berlioz and Pyotr Ilych Tchaikovsky. Vote frequently performs at Opernhaus Zurich; Ganz is considered a leading pianist of his generation. Robert Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano until 1840. In that year alone he composed 138 songs for vocal accompaniment. \"1840 was known as Schumann's 'year of song,'\" pianist Ganz recently said. \"In that year he was finally able to marry the love of his life, pianist Clara Wieck, and in a white heat of inspiration he wrote arguably the greatest songs of the Romantic era. Many of them are almost unbearably beautiful.\" Hector Berlioz, best known for his orchestral music, composed about 50 art songs. Austrian composer Hugo Wolf, particularly noted for his art songs (or lieder) brought to this form a concentrated expressive intensity which was unique in late Romantic music. Also of the late Romantic period, Pyotr Ilych Tchaikovsky bridged European classical training with Russian tradition.<\/p> <p>Olivia Vote, noted for her \"striking expressiveness,\" completed a two year engagement with the Internationales Opernstudio at Opernhaus Zurich and has performed with the Santa Fe Opera, Opera Company of Philadelphia, Wolf Trap Opera Company, the Rai National Symphony Orchestra in Torino, Italy and was a resident artist at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. Brian Ganz is widely regarded as one of the leading pianists of his generation. He has performed world-wide with major symphonies, has won international prizes and is a committed teacher and mentor of young artists both at St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland and Peabody Conservatory.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/229016362\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Fourth Friday: Brian Ganz and Olivia Vote","id":"229016362","time":1458950400000,"updated":1458959148000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Annapolis","address_1":"Generals Hwy Crownsville, MD 21032 ","name":"Ramshead Roadhouse ","lon":-76.577698,"id":24353593,"state":"MD","lat":39.015755,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.1225891113,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458847813000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Lets join up w\/ some other people to go see The Shatners at Ramshead Roadhouse!

The most noticeable changes were that it really pushed me passed my plateau in my growth by helping me clear out some energetic blocks and feelings that I thought I had taken care of. If your true goal is to elevate your vibration, this will do it. The 2nd time and probably the most amazing was getting the spheres to relieve pain. I was having joint pain and migraines. I was about to go on a 2 week vacation with lots of walking, so Jenn gave me the spheres and I didn\u2019t have any hip\/joint pain or migraines the entire time!! It was so good that I told her next time I travel, I\u2019m booking a session with her and asked that she also add spheres to my feet!\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cJenn is too awesome to put into words. Humble, sweet, and loving\u2026she uses these in Holistic Metamorphosis to be a catalyst for the change you seek. If you have tried Reiki, MDH, or other healing work and still need to dig deeper- definitely make an appointment or take the classes being offered. You won\u2019t be sorry. At worst, you will end up freeing some things which have been bothering you.

As witches and innocents are brutally murdered, magic is disappearing from the land, and the roads between the world of humans and that of faeries are vanishing one by one. Ari's family has tended one of the Old Places, places which hold the key to travel between human and faery lands, for generations, keeping the magic alive and the land lush and fertile. Ari unknowingly takes a Fae lover, the Lord of the Sun, and immediately becomes the target of the unwanted interest of the faery nobility.<\/p> <p>To save their world the Fae must trust humankind, but with a few exceptions they do not believe Ari and her friends can help them. Against the Inquisitor and the arrogant Fae, Ari and those who believe in the world of magic and human unravel the secrets of the Old Places and discover that they all need each other if any are to survive.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>======<\/i><\/p> <p>Watch Felicia Day lead online discussion on the Vaginal Fantasy\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fpIcnNlD0uw\">youtube page<\/a>, or follow the group on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/62938-vaginal-fantasy-book-club\">goodreads<\/a>\u00a0page!<\/p> <p>If you're new to the group, don't be afraid to attend the meetup.

Pre-registered Vegan Pledges pledge to live vegan for the duration of the program (approximately one month) with the help of volunteer Vegan Coaches, the VLP educational sessions and materials, and the supportive, encouraging community that forms at each year's program. The goal of the VLP is to springboard participants into lifelong vegan living. OTCA runs a program in Baltimore, Maryland in early Spring, and a program on Long Island in New York in late Spring\/early Summer. If you're vegan-curious, we encourage you to register as a Vegan Pledge at www.VeganLivingProgram.org. If you've lived vegan for a year or more, and would like to help someone else make the transition, please join us as a Vegan Coach: www.VeganLivingProgram.org. Participation in the program is FREE and open to all. Vegan Pledges and Coaches need to pre-register, but anyone may drop by and participate in a VLP educational session, so be sure to invite your vegan-curious friends and family!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1020374828027325\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1020374828027325\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/20s-and-30s-Vegans\/events\/229385398\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"(VLP) Vegan Cooking Demonstration","id":"229385398","time":1459008000000,"updated":1459019929000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449375441000,"name":"20s and 30s Vegans of Baltimore, Columbia, and DC Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":19185955,"urlname":"20s-and-30s-Vegans","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Vegans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"938 York RD","name":"Carver Center","lon":-76.608811,"id":1199015,"state":"MD","lat":39.409557,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.29902172089,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458150923000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Towson-Badminton-Meetup\/events\/229664841\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Play Badminton","id":"fchprlyvfbjc","time":1459011600000,"updated":1459024462000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1457892666000,"name":"Towson Badminton Meetup","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":19702874,"urlname":"Towson-Badminton-Meetup","group_lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Badminton Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"8232 Philadelphia rd","name":"The Little Brick House Wellness Center","lon":-76.50645,"id":24167718,"lat":39.326416,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":6.5847492218,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456510422000,"fee":{"amount":50,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you hear the calling to become an energy healer? A lot of people are finding that they are being drawn more and more to the healing arts to help themselves, their families and their communities.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are offering an amazing opportunity for you to learn the first level of Reiki. The class will be delivered by Reiki Master Stacy Mathias who has 12 years of Reiki healing and teaching experience. We will also offer the 2nd and 3rd levels of Reiki approximately one month apart after level one.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Below is a bit more information about Reiki and it's benefits. Please feel free to comment below or contact us with any questions.<\/p> <p><br\/>What is Reiki?<\/p> <p>Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's \"life force energy\" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.<\/p> <p>How can Reiki help me?<\/p> <p>Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery.<\/p> <p>What does a Reiki treatment feel like?<\/p> <p>A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results. In a standard treatment Reiki energy flows from the practitioner\u2019s hands into the client. The client is usually laying on a massage table but treatments can also be given while the client is seated or even standing. The client remains fully clothed. The practitioner places her\/his hands on or near the clients body in a series of hand positions. These include positions around the head and shoulders, the stomach,and feet.Other, more specific positions may be used based on the clients needs. Each position is held for three to ten minutes depending on how much Reiki the client needs at each position. The whole treatment usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes.<\/p> <p>What happens after my session?<\/p> <p>Most of the time a person will feel relaxed and uplifted by a Reiki treatment. However, sometimes a person will have what is called a healing crisis. As a person\u2019s vibration goes up, toxins that have been stored in the body will be released into the blood stream to be filtered by the liver and kidneys and removed from the system. When this happens, sometimes a person can get a headache or stomach ache or feel weak. If this happens, it is a good idea to drink more water, eat lighter meals and get more rest. The body is cleansing as part of the healing process so this is a good sign.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Healthy-Living-Community\/events\/229155236\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Reiki Level 1 Class","id":"229155236","time":1459011600000,"updated":1459024388000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1448941429000,"name":"Baltimore Healthy Living Community","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":19170317,"urlname":"Baltimore-Healthy-Living-Community","group_lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.60778737068,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458096849000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Bromo Tower \u00a0has become one of the most unique open mics in Baltimore.

This hike may or my not be similar to the normal paths.<\/p> <p>It is an out and back trail around six miles <b>although we won't be doing the full six miles.<\/b> The group we usually hike with general have been finishing this entire trail in just under two hours. We plan to stop at the peninsula to let the dogs enjoy a drink of water and then head back rather then continuing on. This will probable shave off 2 miles. There is usually a cool breeze that comes across that area so dress appropriately. The trail runs from Merrymens road to Dulaney valley road but again we won't be doing the full trail.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please do not sign up for this hike if you are not up to a medium to fast pace, moderate with some strenuous terrain, hiking style. Our group mostly have dogs that don't rough house. They love to hike and burn their energy, but they aren't into all that rowdy play that other dogs love so much.<\/p> <p>terrain:There is one long steeper hill that we plan on doing along with several smaller more moderate hills. Our average hiking speed seems to be running at about 2-3 miles per hour in trail terrain conditions. That's much harder then 2- 3 miles per hour on a tread mill. We like to hike continuously when the weather isn't overly hot. Please think about what speed and style of hiking you and your dog enjoy doing. We don't want to leave anyone behind but we do hike at a fairly quick pace and so does the group of people who hike regularly with us. If you are looking for a relaxed type of hiking you won't enjoy yourself. We hike as a group and push each other as we go along.<\/p> <p>Not good for beginner hikers or those without proper hiking shoes...etc. There will be hills and some water to pass over on stones, falling down tree limbs or by foot with water well past ankle deep at some crossings. Yes big\/deep water crossings to contend with.Don't forget your leash. Bring plenty of water for yourself along with poop bags, snacks (if you or your dog need them), first aid supplies, repellents and sunscreens you and your dog MAY need.<\/p> <p>As always please sign up if you intend to join us as i don't worry about showing up if no one signs up. We will cancel one hour prior hike time if there is inclement weather. Count number of dogs attending when you rsvp as we count dogs not people.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the subaru outback with JMS...

It also served as an important ferry crossing on the main north-south route in the colonies, connecting Charleston, South Carolina with Boston, Massachusetts.\u00a0The town was laid out on 100 acres, overlooking the South River. Roads were created, including Scott, Mackelfish, and Fish Streets among others. And 100 one-acre lots were platted. As a center of transportation and trade, London Town reached its heyday in the 1720s, rivaling nearby Annapolis in terms of economic activity.\u00a0Merchants, planters, carpenters, and coopers were important to the tobacco trade. They all either lived here or owned property in London Town, as did tailors, tavern-keepers, ferry-masters, mariners, ropemakers, blacksmiths, as well as indentured servants, convict servants, and slaves. The Anne Arundel County courthouse was located in London Town from 1685 until 1695, when the court moved to Annapolis, including the cage, whipping post, stocks and pillory.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The prominence of London Town began to fade in the mid-1700s and with the lack of trade during the American Revolutionary War, the port town simply could not survive. Once a vibrant town, consisting of 30 to 40 occupied lots and an estimated population of 300 people, London Town began to disappear from the landscape. Only a few buildings lasted into the 20th\u00a0century, one of which is the impressive brick building, known as the William Brown House, built circa 1760 as an upscale tavern for travelers crossing the South River by ferry boat.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Today, the park consists of one-quarter of the original 100-acre town. Beneath the ground throughout the park, there is evidence of the generations of men, women and children who lived here.

The story is too real, too poignant to be fiction. This Pulitzer Prize and Tony award winning play not only shares a young girl\u2019s life during wartime, but also explores the longings and dreams of all young girls. Innocence and youthful spirit are unquenched by circumstance, as Anne still discovers the world looking at the sky through a crack in the roof. This play is rich drama, because we laugh as well as cry, knowing that life even at its hardest can still be lightened by humor.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/d\/7\/600_446205015.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/228333336\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Theater: Diary of Anne Frank","id":"228333336","time":1459036800000,"updated":1459206463000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21217","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"3100 Swann Drive","name":"Druid Hill Park (Rawlings Conservatory)","lon":-76.645851,"id":8689792,"state":"MD","lat":39.318565,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.41413807869,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453310456000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Due to weather conditions, we are re-scheduling the hike to next Saturday, March 26th at 8PM. <\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNight Hike - Druid Hill Park (Rawlings Conservatory, 3100 Swann Drive) 8 pm \u2013 10 pm<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Friends of Druid Hill Park as we host a night hike in Druid Hill Park.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

While this class supports any religion and faith, and requires tolerance to the diversity of religious traditions within cultures, it does have more of a focus on classic mystery traditions.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you don't know how to journey, please contact Christian (xtian) in advance, although this step is not necessary. A brief introduction to journeying is available for beginners and experienced journeyers new to our group. \u00a0If so, please show up about 15 minutes early.<\/p> <p>This monthly journey group will help students of all levels build the divine connections to their teachers and\/or power animals.

After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life.

If trust is not maintained, refreshed or even if it is violated, we understandably put up our defenses and bringing the walls down can be staggeringly difficult. Trust is essential for deeper relationships and without it we are relegated to solely superficial interactions with others. Therefore, to be healthy and socially involved we need to be skilled in using trust and we need to learn to repair our ability to trust when people inevitably let us down. Taking responsibility and making amends is one way to move forward, but many of us after a breakup or divorce will not receive this type of apology or closure. Therefore, we need to re-learn to trust even in the face of past grievances. Please join us on March 28, 7pm, at New Hope Lutheran Church where Bob Gordon will be presenting and answering questions about re-learning to trust and building deeper relationships. -- Bernie<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainEllicottCity\/events\/228247115\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"How Do I Trust Again?","id":"228247115","time":1459206000000,"updated":1459376975000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347632348000,"name":"Single Again - Columbia\/Ellicott City","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4927242,"urlname":"SingleAgainEllicottCity","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":24.2381458282,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449782433000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please make sure you update your RSVP since we do have a limit on the number of people who can play. \u00a0There will be a waitlist so if the spots are filled you will go on the waitlist until someone changes their RSVP. \u00a0You will get notified by email (as long as you have selected to receive emails from Meetup) when you get moved off the waitlist.<\/p> <p>All levels are welcome!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anne-Arundel-Outdoor-Volleyball\/events\/227683183\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"duration":7200000,"name":"Indoor Volleyball (Read details please)","id":"kvfvmlyvfblc","time":1459206000000,"updated":1459297412000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425675198000,"name":"Anne Arundel Outdoor Volleyball","group_lon":-76.6299972534,"id":18482431,"urlname":"Anne-Arundel-Outdoor-Volleyball","group_lat":38.9399986267,"who":"Volleyballers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"1402 South Main Chapel Way","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-76.679863,"id":11848762,"state":"MD","lat":39.037663,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":17.7634887695,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458569522000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's get together and play rummy and other rummy-like games.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/229638833\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvfbmc","time":1459287000000,"updated":1459341897000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules of this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides, is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aviationvelo.com\/\">Aviation Velo <\/a>(local bike shop in Linthicum) for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours.

This inspiration became the first fantasy roleplaying game, in which players are characters in an ongoing fantasy story. This new kind of game has become immensely popular over the years, and D&amp;D has grown to include many new ways to vividly experience worlds of heroic fantasy.<\/p> <p>The core of D&amp;D is storytelling. You and your friends may tell a story together, guiding your heroes through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more.<\/p> <p>Want to check out some basic rules before plunking down some change for a Starter Set or Player\u2019s Handbook?

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisBaltimore staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisBaltimore staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisbaltimore.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The cost will be $19.95 per tournament except for the inaugural tournament which will be $19.95.<\/p> <p><b>Join Today!!<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 So <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisbaltimore.com\/join\">Join Today <\/a>and we'd be happy to get you enrolled into the next tournament.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Tennis-League\/events\/227891383\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"March Tourney","id":"227891383","time":1459292400000,"updated":1459304622000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1333480917000,"name":"TennisBaltimore.com | Baltimore Tennis League","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":3600592,"urlname":"Baltimore-Tennis-League","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pasadena","address_1":"4730 Mountain Road","name":"Mountain Road Community Library","lon":-76.477432,"id":24333086,"state":"MD","lat":39.105896,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.8656139374,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454012004000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Charles Belfour, author of New York Times bestseller,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/aacp.ent.sirsi.net\/client\/en_US\/default\/search\/results?qu=paris+architect+belfour&amp;te=\">The Paris Architect<\/a>, will be attending the discussion of his novel at Mountain Road Community Library.

To ensure a good rotation of players, we have a limit of 20 players per event. All players have to RSVP to ensure a spot on the court. If after the event starts we have not reached 20 players we will welcome walk-ins. When you reach the facility, please come to the concession area to get your wristband if you RSVP'd of after paying the fee. No Player will be allowed to play without wristband if you paid. We encourage everyone to use MeetUp to for date, time, availability and RSVP each event, so everyone can better plan. We don't do refunds.<\/p> <p>Game Rules:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Good sportsmanship should be present in an out of the court at all times. If this rule is not followed, you will be ask to leave the facility immediately. The idea is to have a good time and exercise. \u2022 Teams a formed as players arrive, is OK to change players as time progresses to balance teams, there is somebody tired or injured.<\/p> <p>\u2022 In case of having more than 2 teams. We follow the \"2 games in\" rule, in which the team that makes steps on the court plays 2 consecutive games, winning or loosing. The only time this is not followed is in the first game, in which, and the winner stays and the other team goes in the back of the waiting list.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Each game is 10 min maximum or 11 points, what ever happens first. There is no need to break a tie except for the first game, because there will always be a team that has played 2 consecutive games. \u2022 Players are welcome to propose new rules, and make changes, like game time changes, but if you can't reach an agreement, you need to follow all the pre-establish rules.
