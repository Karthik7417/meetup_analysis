Remember to drink plenty of water during and after the event to clear toxins and old ways of being that are released from being at the event.

No cash is accepted at the door. There are no refunds and no exceptions. If you are unable to make the event, you can transfer your ticket to a friend before the day of the event (only) and must email me to let me know who is taking your place before 12PM noon.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFINAL NOTE: If your pattern and pain of emotional abuse is not taken care of, learned from and healed, it'll lead you down a hole of feeling helpless, hopeless, angry and sad. You'll avoid intimate relationships and the idea of becoming intimate with someone will be a source of anxiety, depression and fear. Join us at the event to take back your life!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nABOUT THE LOVE GURU:<\/p> <p>The Love Guru Blaire is a Spiritual Teacher, Intuitive Heart Healer, Psychic\/Medium, Love Expert, and Marriage and Family Therapist. Although I am trained as a Marriage and Family Therapist, I work as an Intuitive Heart Healer. This was a gift I was born with and developed over the years. It's the gift to open and heal your heart so you can attract the love and have the relationship (and the life) you desire. I help my clients heal their issues from the root. This way you never have to deal with the same pain again. 60% of clients come to me after they've been in and out of weekly therapy over a 5-10 year time span with little to no results. Creating a dependency is not my objective (quite the opposite, I empower you). When we work together, deep rooted issues get resolved fast. I help clients clear and heal emotional baggage, relationship traumas and blocks that they've been struggling with for OVER 20 YEARS -- WITHIN 3 MONTHS.<\/p> <p>At this event, I'll share my experience with emotional abuse and how I healed my part in the pattern. I'll talk about how I got into my power and how I will never be abused in any relationship ever again. I will guide you through practical tips and techniques on how you can do this too. When you heal that wounded part inside of yourself (and we all have wounded parts) you experience freedom in your life like you have never experienced before. Join me for this powerful event so you can escape this nightmare of a relationship and stop the pattern from continuing, because as you will learn, just because you leave the man or woman who was emotionally abusive to you, this pattern repeats over and over again until you heal what's causing it from within you.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nRAVE REVIEWS FROM PAST EVENTS<\/p> <p>\"Good to see you in the flesh last night.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

Speech can be to oneself in thought, locally to other people in person, propagated generally in media, exchanged universally as money, or systemically distributed as rules and laws.\u00a0 While in person speech is often informal, the use of money and law as speech are formal.\u00a0 Money can be seen as a way of codifying speech into a numerical value and law as way of coding speech into a system of hexadecimal representations of speech.\u00a0 These two operations of communicating via formal codifications are what we do with pen &amp; paper, but more specifically what we do with a computer though a web browser or application.\u00a0 We will be exploring what can be codified into computational form and what cannot.\u00a0 Specifically, we will explore the answer to the questions: \u201cWhat errors arise from this codification process?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat is lost through formalization?\u201d &amp; \u201cWhat modeling capacities are gained through the formalization process?\u201d \u00a0<\/p> <p>Perspective:<\/p> <p>We are able to measure the social world to exact numerical representations with specific laws that must be obeyed.\u00a0 We collapse our spontaneous communicative activity into formal routines in organizations, measurable profit mechanisms, and sometimes even actual computer programs that replace human activity.\u00a0 This reduces the mystery of modern life, yet creates its own complexity as the algorithms, data sets, equations, and textual formalities that both generate our modern world from within and model it from the outside.\u00a0 Our informal interactions now take place within a nexus of complex functions, which tune into our activity as \u2018surveillance\u2019 and ask for input as \u2018feedback.\u2019\u00a0 Yet, as mathematicians, we have a unique ability to interact with these complex systems and create our own.\u00a0 The political economy of mathematics asks how we use this capacity for the pursuit of the political-economic good and the mathematics of political economy asks for the correct way of formally abstracting the complex functions (both implicit and explicit) operating in our modern world.\u00a0 What is the good from the perspective of mathematics?\u00a0 What methods and models can help us attain the good?<\/p> <p>Mathematical Modeling:<\/p> <p>Some social-institutional processes are already formalized, such as in economic, legal, and organizational domains.\u00a0 There complexity can be reduced through higher level mathematical abstractions describing their flows.\u00a0 Other processes are implicit, such as ideation, informal communication, and social-historical transformations.\u00a0 These are delicate and demand an attainment to the object being abstracted.\u00a0 They can be given formal rules via theorization and practical interventions.\u00a0 These can be formalized into mathematical notation to constitute logical domains, with clearly defined operations and functions.\u00a0 The difficulty in abstracting informal activity is not losing sight of the original object, which may be difficult to point to, isolate, or preserve since it is often immaterial and transitory. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Values:<\/p> <p>Ultimately an analysis of everyday life must model and enable values, as in good\/bad, justice\/injustice, love\/hate, peace\/violence, truth\/lies, creation\/destruction, happiness\/sadness, virtue\/vice.\u00a0 Often these take the functional form of dichotomies, with an operator and inverse operator, and can be arranged into algebraic structures for the sake of a specific research agenda. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Research:<\/p> <p>Modeling begins with a theoretical definition of terms that captures a certain essence of the term and fixes its relationship to other terms under study.\u00a0 The research may say in the apriori realm or may seek to be filled by empirical work, either as textual or real number inputs.\u00a0 Ethnography, surveying, and data collection can be performed in person or with the aid of online communication platforms. \u00a0<\/p> <p>A Complex Political Economy:<\/p> <p>Rather than attempting political economy through the standard method of econometrics (real analysis), we will be describing political economy through complex analysis, where \"i\" designates the unmeasurable space of ideas emanating from individual persons, spoken in thought or communicated as meaning.\u00a0 This imaginary component of speech situates itself in phenomenological idealism (Hegel) while the real component of speech in its formal material reality (Marx) is realized through computer systems economic value, and legal codes.\u00a0 Values, as is often taken to be \u2018morality\/immorality,\u2019 mediate between these imaginary and real components of our formal analysis.<\/p> <p>Justice &amp; Violence<\/p> <p>Justice is the distribution of what is deserved.\u00a0 It is a value that corrects errors in political economy by aligning the real distribution of goods to their imaginary presuppositions.\u00a0 Violence, as occurs within injustice, is the degradation of imaginary ideals by the incorrect distribution of real goods.\u00a0 Just political institutions are formal systems that increase the imaginary components of persons belonging to and constituting the political whole.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Measuring Speech:<\/p> <p>Habermas\u2019 universal pragmatics distinguishes speech claims by their illocutionary effect (transmitting intended meaning) and perlocutionary effect (opening intersubjective meanings).\u00a0 This distinction within speech acts cuts upon instrumental speech and communicative, that is speech that is aimed at transforming the state of affairs vs. speech that is aimed at inquiring and understanding. Instrumental speech actions \u2018formalize\u2019 themselves, which is to say that they institute themselves in reality as true propositions.\u00a0 Interpretive speech actions ask about the truths of other persons and reality, leaving themselves as \u2018informal.\u2019\u00a0 In the space of speech actions, we can thus distinguish those that are formal, and thus able to be represented by real numbers, and those that are informal, and thus unable to be mapped to real numbers.\u00a0 The \u2018system\u2019 is the real measure that maps formal speech acts to real numbers, while the \u2018lifeworld\u2019 is the function from informal speech acts to imaginary numbers.\u00a0 Together, this allows us to generate a complex measure from all speech acts to the imaginary &amp; real planes.<\/p> <p>Computer System:<\/p> <p>I will built an online computer system, Mimely, that can be used for interactive research into social reality.\u00a0 I will show it briefly to the group.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please Join us at 7pm: https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/events\/ctutkq2c8qulj008gea15vaviqc","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MATHEMATICS-ACADEMY-MATH-CLUB\/events\/225825361\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Complex Analysis of Systemic Speech","id":"225825361","time":1445384700000,"updated":1445398539000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1242861261000,"name":"Mathematics Academy Math Club - New York City","group_lon":-74,"id":1459657,"urlname":"MATHEMATICS-ACADEMY-MATH-CLUB","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Mathematicians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Computer School, New York, NY 10024","name":"Computer School, New York, NY 10024","lon":-73.977707,"id":10724652,"state":"Ne","lat":40.781078,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":11,"headcount":0,"distance":2.24612569809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1444840142000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Futsal <\/b>Pick up games\u00a0(<b>intermediate to advanced level<\/b>)<\/p> <p><b>Fee<\/b>:\u00a0$10 dollars per player per game; pay through paypal.<\/p> <p>Only 10 players per game, no subs.

I am eager to do more!\u00a0Anna Bartos is knowledgeable about a broad range of musical styles and genres, acting and character development as well as singing.\u00a0I would definitely like to perform in this type of event again.

J. Snyder. As architect for the Board of Education, Snyder revolutionized the city\u2019s schools during his thirty-year career, which coincided with the span of the Progressive Era. He used innovative construction techniques for health and safety. By providing amenities such as gymnasiums, auditoriums, and science laboratories, he transformed the simple 19th-century schoolhouse consisting of just classrooms into the complex 20th-century school building that we know today. And he \u201cdid that which no other architect before his time ever tried or did,\u201d said Jacob Riis, \u201che built them beautiful.\u201d More than half of Snyder\u2019s 400 school buildings and additions still function today as public schools. Architect and historian Robers A. M. Stern has deemed them \u201ceveryday masterpieces, among the great glories of our city.\u201d The history of Snyder\u2019s schools shows how the United States has contributed to the provision of universal public education, especially in New York City, which remains today the largest public-school system in the country, as it was in Snyder\u2019s day.

He was in the very first digital reporting class taught at the Columbia Journalism School in 1995, and was hired by Time Inc. to launch the website for Peoplemagazine while still in school. He later helped bring Time and other magazines into the digital age, and created one of the Web\u2019s first original daily news outlets, called The Netly News, which chronicled the Internet's effect on everything from reading to retail and music. He\u2019s interviewed many of the key figures in digital history, including the inventor of the web, the coder who first distributed MP3 music, two of Twitter's creators, the lead designer of the iPod, and even asked Bill Gates whether he was a bigger fan of Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk or Jean-Luc Picard (he chose Kirk).

The renovation includes Jerusalem stone paneling, which gives the space an extra special touch. The decor of the place makes you feel like you've entered a high-end New York restaurant.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit.

In this talk I share some of the mistakes I've made, and seen others make, whilst designing and managing systematic trading systems for both a multi billion hedge fund and a retail trading account.

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

The most important aspect of all your social media campaigns is creating original content to drive people to your web site so that your SEO increases. (Search engine optimization) Translated, this means that you will show high when someone does a Google search for a product or service you offer.<\/p> <p>On October 22, we will be treated to a presentation by Rupa Kale, a Summit\/New Providence B.I.G. member who owns Bottle &amp; Bottega in Berkeley Heights and who just earned a prestigious social media marketing award by her company. Our meeting will be from 10-11:30 at Twin Maples, 214 Springfield Ave. in Summit.<\/p> <p>Last month we had over 25 people attend. We expect at least that this month. With such a nice-sized group, there is going to be a vast range in the amount of knowledge of the women in the room. That is a good thing. While some of us were able to share the best URL shortener and link management platforms, others were asking what a hash tag is. The beauty of BIG is that we can all help and support each other! The content of the meeting will be driven by what the people present want to know.<\/p> <p>Plan on joining us for lunch at a local restaurant following the meeting!

If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226160165\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Thursday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226160165","time":1445547600000,"updated":1445560441000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 45th Street (Between 6th & 7th Ave.)","name":"Cranberry Cafe","lon":-73.94519,"id":6580602,"state":"NY","lat":40.813438,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.9805932045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423802479000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTICE: While we officially start at 5pm, please feel free to join us anytime after 5pm.

How did life start on planet earth 3.5 billion years ago, and which molecules \/ chemical systems lead to biology? Could evolution be the ultimate creationist? Is there are general theory of evolution that extends to all matter? Can we make or evolve life from scratch in a matter of hours? These are fantastically interesting questions but in this lecture, rather than look back into the past, we will look to the future and discuss how chemists may go about creating new types of truly synthetic (artificial or inorganic biology). In embarking upon this quest we will be asking the question \u201cWhat is the minimal chemical system that can undergo Darwinian evolution?\u201d and in doing so looking towards the concept of \u2018adaptive matter\u2019 and evolvable materials and chemical systems. The aim is inorganic biology, or more simply, a living system that does not the current chemical infrastructure utilized by biology.<\/p> <p>We will not only discuss abstract concepts, but real chemistry and experiments that we have constructed in Glasgow, see the photo below. Importantly a rigorous experimental approach will be debated that will allow peers to scrutinize and test the validity of our approach to the production of autonomous chemical entities capable of replication and adaptive behavior.<\/p> <p>Reception: starts 6.00<br\/>Lecture start time: 7.30<br\/>Close: 8.30<\/p> <p>Refreshments and drinks included.<\/p> <p>Lee Cronin FRSE. Professional Career: 2013-Regius Professor of Chemistry. Alexander von Humboldt research fellow (Uni. of Bielefeld);[masked]: Research fellow (Uni. of Edinburgh); 1997: Ph.D. Bio-Inorganic Chemistry, Uni. of York; 1994 BSc. Chemistry, First Class, Uni. of York. Prizes include 2015 RSC Tilden Prize, 2013 BP\/RSE Hutton Prize, 2012 RSC Corday Morgan, 2011 RSC Bob Hay Lectureship, a Wolfson-Royal Society Merit Award in 2009, Election to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009. The focus of Cronin\u2019s work is understanding and controlling self-assembly and self-organisation in Chemistry to develop functional molecular and nano-molecular chemical systems (including solar fuel systems); linking architectural design with function and recently engineering system-level functions (e.g. coupled catalytic self-assembly, emergence of inorganic materials and fabrication of inorganic cells that allow complex cooperative behaviours). Much of this work is converging on exploring the assembly and engineering of emergent chemical systems aiming towards \u2018inorganic biology\u2019. This work has been presented in over 320 papers and 280 lectures worldwide. It is also worth pointing out that the expertise in the Cronin group (which numbers over 50 people and &gt; \u00a310 M in funding) is unique bringing together inorganic \/ synthetic chemists, chemical engineers, flow chemistry, digital chemistry, complex system modelling, evolutionary theory, robotics and AI.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYCSkeptics-Meetup-Group\/events\/225533565\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"The Evolutionary Genesis Engine - An Evening With Lee Cronin (Lecture 7:30pm)","id":"225533565","time":1445551200000,"updated":1445563874000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1173640321000,"name":"The New York City Skeptics Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":448750,"urlname":"The-NYCSkeptics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Skeptics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11040","country":"us","city":"New Hyde Park","address_1":"2232 Jericho Turnpike","name":"Bramasole Italian Restaurant","lon":-73.666412,"id":17068042,"state":"Ne","lat":40.739086,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":16.9901714325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442022358000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/2\/c\/600_6206668.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Psychic Night! and FREE MINGLE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 @ 6pm -9pm <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>ALL Welcomed.

In this session we will explore an important adjacent-role of the database, to efficiently perform computations and create derived data.<\/p> <p>Relational databases have been successful for several decades now because they provide a well defined computational framework, which is built on top of relational algebra. The relational algebra defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data.<\/p> <p>However, times change and we are presently in a situation where relational databases do not easily scale to the amounts of data that businesses and organizations around the world are dealing with. NoSQL technology has emerged as an attempt to address this, but NoSQL loses the computational aspect. The majority of NoSQL databases are glorified key-value stores that support CRUD operations, but do not define a solid computational model.<\/p> <p>Alternatively, MapReduce defines a computational framework to process large amounts of data, but has its own caveats. It encourages batch processing and full-scans of data, so the computation becomes detached from stored data.<\/p> <p>It is our belief that the data management industry will move into the direction of consolidating storage, which will allow computing power and new databases to emerge; these will both scale to data storage needs as well as provide a solid online computational framework.<\/p> <p>This session will teach you about a computing engine that is built into the database and allows arbitrary JavaScript-based code to be executed directly in the database, next to the data.<\/p> <p>This setup provides a simple and powerful computational model that ensures data is accessed through efficient indices directly in the database, thus massively accelerating data manipulation operations.<\/p> <p>Throughout this talk, we will present examples of how advanced computation can be done directly in the database, including an analysis of geospatial data, and the application of statistical model-like logistic regression to derive predictions.<\/p> <p><b>Jurgis Orups, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Clusterpoint<\/b><\/p> <p>Jurgis co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clusterpoint.com\/\">Clusterpoint<\/a> in 2006.<\/p> <p>Prior to that, he spent 6-years managing a team building large-scale Internet crawler and search technology.

It has grown from being a concept embraced by a small number of companies such as The Body Shop in the early 1990s to a widespread global movement. At its weakest level, it is represented by a few philanthropic gestures by organisations, but when applied in its most complete form, it can steer the organization or sector to deliver a fully-fledged, system-wide, multi-stakeholder operation, accompanied by multiple types of certification.<\/p> <p>For the first time, a book brings together key issues relating to CSR as they apply to different aspects of business; it is not another generalist title about CSR. Michael Hopkins, a leading expert in the field, is joined by a number of outstanding contributors to the book, to explain how CSR has evolved since the 1990s and to offer ground-breaking insights and practical and specific applications of the concept. For example, Mervyn King explains Integrating Reporting, Deborah Leipziger looks at CSR, Branding and the Supply Chain, George Starcher provides a framework for Socially Responsible Restructuring, and Adrian Henriques explores Social Accounting and Stakeholder Dialogue.<\/p> <p>* A one-stop reference book for professionals and students of CSR<\/p> <p>* Contributions from leading specialists in the application of CSR<\/p> <p>* Translates well-established theories into practical tools<\/p> <p>We have to make charge to ensure we have a properly set up room ($20).

In this biweekly series, we\u2019ll explore classic introductory Buddhist books. Although we have \u201creading assignments\u201d, the meetings focus more on basic Buddhist teachings rather than strict discussions of the books. Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

This book is really charming and delightful, and I think it will be interesting to see how this book (written in 2014) addresses futuristic notions of gender and race, albeit in a much lighter setting!<\/p> <p>From Goodreads:<\/p> <p>Somewhere within our crowded sky, a crew of wormhole builders hops from planet to planet, on their way to the job of a lifetime. To the galaxy at large, humanity is a minor species, and one patched-up construction vessel is a mere speck on the starchart. This is an everyday sort of ship, just trying to get from here to there.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But all voyages leave their mark, and even the most ordinary of people have stories worth telling. A young Martian woman, hoping the vastness of space will put some distance between herself and the life she\u2018s left behind. An alien pilot, navigating life without her own kind. A pacifist captain, awaiting the return of a loved one at war.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Set against a backdrop of curious cultures and distant worlds, this episodic tale weaves together the adventures of nine eclectic characters, each on a journey of their own.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPS - I'm also going to drop a couple books from our current list as they're not getting a lot of love in the polls.

This discussion will demonstrate how project management can not only co-exist with your agile process, but thrive. Plus, you'll learn how Gilt blends agile principles with traditional project management techniques to bring their strategic initiatives to life.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>Justin Riservato has been an integral part of Gilt\u2019s growth since 2009. Justin has worked with just about every team and department at Gilt, developing a direct, \u201ctell the truth\u201d approach and philosophy to project communication that has improved both collaboration and trust across teams. From his past life of living and working on sailboats, Justin has been able to draw numerous parallels between program management and working on a ship\u2014at least the way he does it!<\/p> <p>7:40PM<\/p> <p>Just-In-Time Business Operations (Yeah, there's an add-on for that!)<\/p> <p>by\u00a0Ethan Foulkes, Camerican<\/p> <p>Learn how Camerican International, one of the worlds largest food import\/export companies, has integrated numerous add-ons in Confluence to build a custom CRM on a limited budget and without any in-house programmers. The Atlassian ecosystem is full of existing add-ons you can use, as well as developers looking for new ideas to build. Understanding how to manage multiple add-ons and work with the various vendors is the key to unlocking huge value. Come see what\u2019s possible!<\/p> <p>About the speaker:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Always an IT nerd at heart Ethan started off his career in tech support, originally in dial-up modem support and eventually as a Network Security Engineer. In his early 20's he departed from this promising career track to play professional poker. 8 years later, having successfully competed at the highest levels it was time for a new challenge. In his current role, Ethan develops custom business tools by extending Confluence through add-ons. His people skills, honed through years of poker playing, help him to understand what motivates people and use that to drive adoption of those tools. Ethan has an amazing wife and an energetic 5 year old son who keeps him active. Time is valuable but he still manages to find enough to help run the NYC Atlassian User Group.<\/p> <p>8:00PM<\/p> <p>Agile Development with Chuck Norris<\/p> <p>by Madhusudhan Matrubai, Barclays<\/p> <p>The session gives a brief overview on the challenges that an Agile development team faced before adopting agile tools, it walks through on how adopting the Chuck Norris suite transformed an ordinary Agile team into power packed ChuckAgile Team. The suite consists of various Atlassian tools like Confluence, Jira, Bitbucket (including Stash), Bamboo and Jira Service Desk and is referred here as \"Chuck Norris\" for obvious reasons of agility, flexibility, traceability and various other adjectives. The session highlights on how the integration between these tools contributed for a greater transparency, traceability, collaboration and increased productivity. Agility redefined by Chuck Norris.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>Entered into the earth portal from the city of Bangalore, India. Did my Bachelors of Engineering in Instrumentation Technology from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore - India. I have over 13 yrs of Experience in IT and have performed various kinds of roles and I like my current role in the DevOps area in the banking industry in Big Apple.<\/p> <p>8:20PM<\/p> <p>More eating, drinking, networking!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/aug.atlassian.com\/cities\/newyorkny\/annualpre-summitbash","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/augnyc\/events\/226083884\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Annual Pre-Summit Bash!","id":"226083884","time":1445554800000,"updated":1445610023000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377527897000,"name":"Atlassian User Group NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":9975812,"urlname":"augnyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10016","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"171 Madison Ave., Suite 908","name":"Madison Wellness Center","lon":-73.983391,"id":1527297,"state":"NY","lat":40.747391,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":45,"headcount":0,"distance":0.390693575144,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444855557000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Greetings Dear Friends,<\/b><\/p> <p>Greetings Dear Friends,<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session, we'll release conditioning that keeps us stuck in bad habits, compulsions and addictions.

If we dig deep enough into these issues, we'll always find that they're sourced in fear, and that underneath the fear there is a wealth of buried spiritual treasure - insights, wisdom, talents, creativity, love and joy.<br\/><i>Please be informed that this is the last session we'll do at the old rate of $20. We set that fee 7 yrs. ago and since then both Carol and I have spent thousands of dollars on higher trainings and have become much more adept and accomplished as healers, not to mention that the cost of living has risen substantially. So after this session, the in person fee will be $25 and the distant fee will be $22. This new fees will help cover the processing fee for PayPal payments and the cost of renting Madison Wellness Center for the event, as well as putting a few extra dollars in our pockets. I'll think you'll agree that that's not too much to ask considering what you're getting for your money!<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>In the 7 yrs that we've been doing these sessions, they've become my most popular event, averaging 25 - 35 people. You can come in person or sign up for the distant healing list (you can put your pets on the distant healing list for free). I've kept the cost of low ($20) because I'm committed to providing low cost high quality holistic services which the average working person can take advantage of regularly if they wish.

I suffer from depression and each session makes me feel like a child at my healthiest and happiest state, or as if I am on a very high dose of anti - depressants without the terrible side effects.

It is gem of a show on Adult Swim that is easy to miss. It stars a super scientist and his young grandson in a host of nutty comedic adventures.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you watch just one episode you may be tempted to disregard it because of the juvenile humor (burping, etc) that entertains the weak of mind. This would be a mistake. Rick &amp; Morty is actually a brilliant exploration of various science fiction tropes. In a meaner reworking of Back to the Future's zany super-scientist Emmet Brown, Rick Sanchez takes a young wide-eyed high school student Marty McFly on various adventures. However, in today's modern world an old scientist frequently sneaking off alone with a teen would be considered far creepier than it was in the 80's. Therefore they have swapped out \"Marty\" for \"Morty\", Sanchez's 14 year old grandson (see, a lot less creepy!). Together they use comedy to deconstruct, from unexpected and unique angles, various sci-fi, television, and real world assumptions. Some of these shows are simply brilliant and hilarious. (How they portray the Borg is simply too funny to be believed).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nSo come hang out with us.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/224884746\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Each Thurs. from 7-9pm  Happiness and Goodness at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"krgdllytnbdc","time":1445554800000,"updated":1445654201000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":150,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":30,"created":1444839001000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us on for three talks on algorithmic trading, great food, and a chance to meet other members in our community.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Search for the Holy Grail of Investing<\/b><\/p> <p>It has been said that diversification is the only free lunch.* Yet,\u00a0<b>achieving consistent diversification <\/b>across many distinct quantitative investment strategies\u00a0each with limited life-spans can quickly become a very expensive research problem.<\/p> <p><br\/>Join Dr. Jess Stauth, vice president of Quant Strategy at\u00a0Quantopian, and\u00a0learn about the tools and techniques\u00a0Quantopian is developing to select and invest in algorithms sourced from a crowd of <b>over 50,000 quants, hackers, data scientists and finance geeks.<\/b><\/p> <p>Read ahead by checking out\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/quantopian.github.io\/pyfolio\/\"><b>pyfolio<\/b><\/a>,\u00a0the open-sourced Python library for performance and risk analysis developed by Quantopian.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/quantopian.github.io\/pyfolio\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/quantopian.github.io\/pyfolio\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/quantopian.github.io\/pyfolio\/<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>How to Build a Long-Short Equity Strategy and the New Pipeline API<\/b><\/p> <p>Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie\u00a0will review <b>how to build a long-short equity strategy <\/b>and\u00a0Karen Rubin\u00a0will show you how to use <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quantopian.com\/posts\/introducing-the-pipeline-api\">the new Pipeline API <\/a><\/b>when building these types of algorithms.\u00a0With the addition of the\u00a0pipeline, you can now dynamically select portfolios from the <b>entire universe of\u00a08000+ securities.<\/b> This enables\u00a0<b>factor modeling, custom screening,\u00a0and\u00a0more statistically robust strategies.<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quantopian.com\/\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quantopian.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.quantopian.com\/<\/a><\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>*Food and drinks will be served at the event.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Where:\u00a0<\/b>BlackRock, Auditorium 11D\/E, 11th Floor\u00a055 E 52nd Street\u00a0,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY\u00a010055.\u00a0<b>Please go up the escalators as soon as you enter the building and present you ID at the BlackRock reception.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Speakers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Jess Stauth<\/b>\u00a0is Quantopian's VP of Quant Strategy.

Oh, and maybe even meet that special someone! This event is for singles (no couples). We will meet ahead of time at 7:30 for a pre-mingle at a bar (The Three Monkeys Bar - 236 W. 54 St) down the block from the comedy club where you can meet the other friendly singles who will be attending the comedy show. Our event host for the night will facilitate introductions (Basically this means that someone will be there to casually make sure you get to meet at least some of the people in the group so absolutely no one is left out. We encourage a friendly attitude from all attending and honestly this event usually attracts really nice, friendly people). We will then all head to the comedy club at 8:30. We have a section (tables) reserved at Broadway Comedy Club.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: The Comedy Show Starts At 9:00 PM At Broadway Comedy Club But We Will Be Meeting For A Pre-Mingle At 7:30 At The Three Monkeys Bar (236 W. 54 St. between Broadway and 8th Ave) Which Is Just 1 Block Over And We Then Head Over To The Comedy Club Together. Look For Our Reserved Section At Three Monkeys Bar With Our \"Reserved For Click Event Meetup\" Sign. If You Can't Make It To The Pre-Mingle, Simply Meet Us At The Comedy Club At 8:40 (You'll See Our Reserved Section There As Well).<\/p> <p>TICKETS: $22 (You Must Pre-Pay Online.

Goods are imported and produced. Waste must be managed. Cities are becoming more sustainable, but can we go beyond that? Instead of just reducing our footprint, is it possible to create regenerative cities that still meet our human needs? Can our problems actually become solutions? The Urban Permaculture Conference (UPC) will kickstart a dialogue and strengthen alliances among key players in the urban sustainability movement. It will bring together urban professionals, researchers, and permaculture designers to expand their interdisciplinary toolboxes. The UPC will showcase the connections between permaculture design, green architecture, engineering, science, city planning, and sustainability education. We will lay the foundation for a safer and greener tomorrow because each field contributes to the greater whole. Permaculture is a design philosophy that emphasizes integration and whole-systems methodology. Permaculture can create a model for urban revitalization through a city infrastructure that\u2019s both functional and beautiful, but it can also empower citizens socially and economically---not just through the city landscape. Permaculture can enhance community diversity, promote food and water security, and strengthen local economies. Beyond Organic Design (BOD) is hosting the UPC in partnership with the City College of New York (CCNY). The UPC features speakers who are experts in permaculture, architecture, engineering, parks, and city planning. This cutting-edge event will be dynamic and interactive with exciting workshops, panels, and group discussions. But it\u2019s not just all talk. There will be community tours, good food and drink, a screening of the new permaculture movie INHABIT, live music, and much more. The UPC will demonstrate possibilities for creating a regenerative urban model that benefits city dwellers around the world. Beyond Organic Design (BOD), located in New York City, offers sustainability education, events planning, and ecological design services for public and private clients.

It is driven by creativity, sustainability and environmental responsibility. We are beginning to build materials using living systems. And in these workshop participants will have the opportunity to learn about one of the most exciting emerging areas in this field - that of bacterial inks and dyes! Internationally renowned leaders in this space, Pili Bio's Thomas Landrain and Natsai Audrey Chieza, will each lead a workshop at Genspace. The first, introducing participants to the science behind the production of bacterial inks and the second, exploring how bacterial dyes could be used for future textile applications. These workshops have been specifically developed to work in parallel with the Biofabricate 2015 summit, allowing some of the ideas of the summit to translate into hands-on experiences. It is the aim that by engaging with these new materials and processes further exciting conversations and possibilities will emerge.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Nevins Street station on the 2,3,4 or 5 train.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Biohackers\/events\/226159427\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Biopigments Workshops","id":"226159427","time":1445612400000,"updated":1445624270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369658080000,"name":"Brooklyn Biohackers","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":8659672,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Biohackers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Biohackers, Geeks, DIYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"11th Ave","name":"Jacob Javits Convention Center ","lon":-74.002002,"id":768969,"state":"NY","lat":40.755783,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.745909690857,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445441172000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I will be speaking at the Unique Photo booth on the topic, \"Working With Inexperienced Models\" on Friday and Saturday of this week at the Photo Plus Expo at Javits Convention Center. \u00a0I will have a live model present and I will be demonstrating some lighting setups and posing techniques \u00a0with her. \u00a0I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Presentation: Working With Inexperienced Models<\/p> <p>Day and Time: Friday at 11:30am and Saturday at 12:30am<\/p> <p>Location: Unique Photo Booth (#850), Javits Convention Center, Photo Plus Expo<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI'll also be announcing a new meet up, at this event. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJohn Ricard<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Portrait-Photography-Seminars-and-Meetups\/events\/226210353\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"\"Working With Inexperienced Models\" presentation","id":"226210353","time":1445614200000,"updated":1445626676000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390247362000,"name":"NYC Portrait Photography Seminars and Meetups","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":12309762,"urlname":"NYC-Portrait-Photography-Seminars-and-Meetups","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"155 W. 72nd Street, #601","name":"Zenyasa Yoga & Wellness Studio","lon":-73.980469,"id":24097271,"state":"NY","lat":40.778435,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.03102874756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444853920000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Gentle Beginnings\/Open Level Yoga with Kelly.
