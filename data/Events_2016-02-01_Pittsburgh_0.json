Several different kinds of certifications are available at the completion of the program.<\/p> <p>It is my hope that this opportunity will help people with their own healing work, their own spiritual path, help provide direction and information, and help provide the education necessary for members of our community to be safer when choosing practitioners and participating in the shamanic community.<\/p> <p>This is the only time I will be presenting basic info, as the course will start January 16 with it's first meeting, and after that we will not be accepting new additions to the class because they will simply be too far behind.<\/p> <p>So come on down, ask your questions, meet cool people, and see if this is something that will help you on your path.<\/p> <p>Love to you.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/227579548\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Informational Meeting for Shamanism Class","id":"227579548","time":1451768400000,"updated":1451780706000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447009009000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let us come together to build a community of meditators and spread the benefits of meditation among Pittsburghers.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Together we deliver the future of healthcare by caring for the community who represent our individual well being for the sake of the generations to come.<\/p> <p>Description<\/p> <p>Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People or TRFCP, is a community based service concerning individuals unable to afford or have easy access to holistic healthcare. Developed to support our elders who represent our roots and traditions, warriors who represent and defend our nation, \"tree\" women who represent the diversity of women who struggle through sexual, physical, mental and emotional abuse, and children in need, who represent our future and inspiration.<\/p> <p>The vision of TRFCP is supported by Herbalist's without Borders, The Union Project and Ola's Herb Shop who have collaborated with the understanding that the importance to provide this kind of space to support all members of the community is paramount. All people reflect our individual selves, therefore our societal health. In addition, access to holistic health interventions are not always accessible and available to everyone, yet are traditionally and scientifically proven to be highly effective forms of healing from which many can benefit.<\/p> <p>The clinic will be available once a month and individuals will sign-up or have scheduled visits (particularly groups coming from a facility or organization).<\/p> <p>Current days are every first Wednesday of the month, hours 1-7p.<\/p> <p>Expect to be supported by volunteer practitioner(s) of holistic health who may provide botanical therapy, meditation, Reiki, intuitive counseling, yoga, massage therapy, reflexology and much more depending on the needs of the people and the practitioners who have volunteered their services for that day.<\/p> <p>It is our hope that all forms of donations, through service, volunteer work or financial bases from interested members of the community, will sustain this vision because it is forseen to create a paradigm shift in community healthcare and delivery for the sake of us all.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/227430963\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Potology Sessions at the Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People - NEW LOCATION","id":"psckklyvcbjb","time":1452103200000,"updated":1452135407000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Market Square","name":"The Yard ","lon":-80.00249,"id":24098599,"lat":40.440372,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.44335174561,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445909339000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/6\/4\/600_445486180.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join\u00a0Ad2 Pittsburgh\u00a0and\u00a0Pittsburgh Ad Fed\u00a0for Juice from 5 p.m.-??

But please click on it again.<\/p> <p>Then scroll down to the bottom and click on Holiday Coping<\/p> <p>Then scroll to the 6th item and click on Tips for New Year Resolutions<\/p> <p>Since this January meeting is the start of the new year of 2016, let's talk about this topic. The first tip is: If you don't intend to keep resolutions, then don't make them. And the second tip is: If the attraction of status quo is greater than that of a change, then don't make the resolution. However .....<br\/>There is further commentary, leaving the table open for anyone who has made resolutions and wants to share them.<\/p> <p>I particularly like this suggestion: Make a 10% improvement in your attitude of gratitude and satisfaction.<\/p> <p>Continue reading and see what ideas you can share with the group. Some of you read the book \"10% Happier\" by ABC correspondent Dan Harris and might want to reference his experiences. And for those who have the \"Happy Women Live Better\" book by Valorie Burton, you might want to re-read Chapter 5 on Gratitude; how the art of appreciation causes you to work out more, sleep better, and be less agitated.<\/p> <p>Note: We seem to run out of time before we run out of conversation, so please think about a topic or two you would like to facilitate for our future meetings -- the second Sunday of each month at 10:30 at the Robinson Eat N Park. If you provide the details, I will be happy to post the meeting notice. Looking forward to a great turnout. Thanks.

This is a timeless tradition observed by ancient cultures. It serves as a regular forum for empowering girls and women of all ages. Every decade in our lives is special and we each have something to offer. We each have a piece to the puzzle of life.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Traditionally girls would enter the tent as soon as their bodies began to cycle with the moon. In the tent they would learn about their fertility cycles and every other faucet of being a woman . A red Tent is a gift of mystical understanding of womanhood where secret knowledge will be shared and women will learn the value of their bodies as physical temples and how to set personal boundaries accordingly. A Red Tent provides an authentic foundation of support and an opportunity to connect with your inner self, other women and the greater cycles as we journey around the astrological mandala, working with the themes and lessons of each sign , as well as with Native American teachings and ceremony. Through these teachings and ceremony we will experience greater wholeness and balance in our lives. The Red Tent is a place where you can let your hair down and relax \u00a0knowing that whatever is shared is not gossiped about outside the gathering. It is a nurturing space to gather without fear of competition. A place to explore new ideas and reflect upon our personal journeys. Each month we will share our strengths, vulnerabilities and life lessons mirrored in each other, which creates deeper understanding and compassion for ourselves and others. In the tent there is freedom to share life's high's and low's<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"You will be greeted at the door.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Social-Club\/events\/227379349\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Red Tent Moonlodge: A Sacred Gathering of Women","id":"hdxvdlyvcbdc","time":1452459600000,"updated":1452471252000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1296173711000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Social Club!","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1773927,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Social-Club","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Socializers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue ","name":"Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Squirrel Hill Room A","lon":-79.92263,"id":24284624,"state":"PA","lat":40.438454,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.61701893806,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452015726000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let us come together to build a community of meditators and spread the benefits of meditation among Pittsburghers.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.

As the organizer of this group, I wanted to create an atmosphere where people who have the heart to help raise money for the cause(s) they care about most could gather together with organizations in need of financial support in a social environment and share fundraising ideas and \/ or stories with one another. Being the president of a local branch of a national non profit organization, I'm looking forward to meeting others like myself and sharing what fundraising tools our branch uses. To be completely honest, one of the methods we are about to implement is so exciting I can't wait to share it with everyone! The cost to our organization to use this method is nothing, we can partner with other organizations (in fact, the more organizations we partner with, the more each organization will earn), and even the volunteers that actively participate in the campaign will earn money too! I know it may be a little hard to believe, but there are socially responsible corporations out there that have programs designed to give a portion of their profits back to non profit organizations. You'll be surprised and excited about many of the programs and methods that exists! I can't wait to share some of them with you all. Please bring paper and pen to take notes. Also, feel free to invite anyone you feel that could benefit from learning about new ways to fund raise.

Adagio non troppo \u2013 Allegro non tardante II. Canzonetta. Allegretto (G minor) III. Andante espressivo IV. Molto allegro e vivace<\/p> <p>I am composing a quartet for you,\u201d Mendelssohn told Betty Pistor.<\/p> <p>Without her knowledge, he secretly added the initials B.P. above his autograph on the score.\u00a0 Betty was a neighbor and the daughter of a Berlin astronomer, a year older than Felix, and sang in the choir he accompanied on Friday nights in Berlin. Mendelssohn's romantic feelings for Betty were never reciprocated,<\/p> <p>Further analysis of the score shows how the Allegro movement uses the notes Bb - Eb, in German B - Es, three letters extracted from Betty's name (this theme is also echoed in the fourth movement).<\/p> <p>A very unusual feature of the quartet is that every movement is set in a different key (E-flat major, G Minor, B-flat major and C Minor).<\/p> <p>Mendelssohn was very much entrenched in the works of Beethoven at the time, and the quartet certainly reflects his influence. His later quartets return to a more formal classical style, however the Eb quartet evokes a somewhat restless wildness reminiscent of Beethoven.<\/p> <p>The Canzonetta (second movement) replaces the traditional scherzo. The movement features delicate pizzicato accompaniment with a fanciful middle section that recalls the composer's Overture to \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" The Andante espressivo is a romantic song without words. The Molto allegro e vivace completes the work with a stormy tempest.<\/p> <p>Manfred Lehmann writes,\"I recently heard Mendelssohn's String Quartet in E-flat Major, Opus 12, and was struck with the Jewish-sounding themes, especially in the first movement, which could have been taken out of the Kol Nidre melody.\" Felix was born a Jew, the grandson of the great Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. but was baptized as a Lutheran Protestant as a young boy.\u00a0 Although there has been much discussion regarding Mendelssohn's religious beliefs, he was born into a very tortuous period in Jewish history.<\/p> <p><i><b>Oswaldo Golijov - Tenebrae\u00a0 (2002)<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Golijov was born to Romanian Jewish parents living in La Plata, Argentina. His mother was a piano teacher mother and his father a physician. He was exposed to classical music, Jewish liturgical music, klezmer and tango. After studying piano at the local conservatory and composition with Gerardo Gandini he moved to Israel in 1983, where he studied with Mark Kopytman at the Jerusalem Rubin Academy. Upon moving to the United States in 1986, Golijov earned his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied with George Crumb.<\/p> <p>In 2002 he was commissioned to write a piece for the Spoleto Music Festival in Charleston, SC. The festival performed version 1 of his Tenebrae, written for soprano, clarinet and string quartet. Version 2 was later arranged for string quartet.<\/p> <p>Here are the composer's notes:<\/p> <p>\"I wrote Tenebrae as a consequence of witnessing two contrasting realities in a short period of time in September 2000. I was in Israel at the start of the new wave of violence that is still continuing today, and a week later I took my son to the new planetarium in New York, where we could see the Earth as a beautiful blue dot in space. I wanted to write a piece that could be listened to from different perspectives. That is, if one chooses to listen to it \"from afar\", the music would probably offer a \"beautiful\" surface but, from a metaphorically closer distance, one could hear that, beneath that surface, the music is full of pain. I lifted some of the haunting melismas from Couperin's Troisieme Le\u00e7on de Tenebrae, using them as sources for loops, and wrote new interludes between them, always within a pulsating, vibrating, aerial texture. The compositional challenge was to write music that would sound as an orbiting spaceship that never touches ground. After finishing the composition, I realized that Tenebrae could be heard as the slow, quiet reading of an illuminated medieval manuscript in which the appearances of the voice singing the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet (from Yod to Nun, as in Couperin) signal the beginning of new chapters, leading to the ending section, built around a single, repeated word: Jerusalem.\"<\/p> <p><b><i>George Gershwin, Lullaby for Strings\u00a0 (1919)<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>George Gershwin wrote his Lullaby for strings in 1919, and it was performed often at private musicales held by Gershwin's friends. In<\/p> <p>1967 the quartet received it's first public performance by the Juilliard String Quartet.\u00a0 In 1968, Ira Gershwin wrote, \u201cIt may not be the Gershwin of Rhapsody in Blue, Concerto in F, and his other concert works, but I find it charming and kind.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Additional Notes<\/b><\/p> <p>Mendelssohn's cryptic dedication is more commonly used than we may think.

A chef who weighs 98 pounds, Mya Zeronis started cooking plant-strong Burmese farm food in her parents\u2019 kitchen at the age of 11. Despite her decade-long career in conventional, meat-centric, butter-drowned, flour-covered and sugar-coated U.S. restaurant kitchens, she identified a need for healthful foods in Pittsburgh and made it her business in 2013. By returning to her roots, she resolved some of her health issues resulted from eating whatever was readily available in restaurant kitchens. Her multifaceted business (personal chef and catering services, raw organic juice bar, vegan whole food cafe and monthly plant-based superfood brunches) aims to make healthy eating and sustainable living accessible. Nearly a dozen of her recipes won top prizes in national and local contests. Some others were published in magazines and cookbooks. Her monthly vegan, gluten-free brunch is discovered by foodies from as far as Austin.<\/p> <p>[4 BEVERAGES] Juice counter for make-your-own raw fresh juice blends: Orange Glow - carrots, Mandarin oranges, ginger; Virgin Mary - tomatoes, celery, banana peppers, garlic, lemon, pink Himalayan salt\u00a0<\/p> <p>Raw vegan nog with coconut milk, bananas, cinnamon, nut mag, cloves, turmeric, nutritional yeast, vanilla\u00a0<\/p> <p>Organic, fair-trade coffee with homemade almond milk and grade B dark organic maple syrup<\/p> <p>[10 DISHES] See ticket link.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>This is reservation-only event and guests must pay in advance.

However, we do not want price to be an obstacle for anyone attending class. Beginners have the option of purchasing a coupon booklet (good for 10 classes) for $30.

One member, whose grandfather had been interviewed for a book, wrote to the author to ask about additional notes from the author's interview with the grandfather... In return, the author provided her with copies of the tapes of the interview! Another member had success in finding a lost newspaper article on Google News Archive.

For example, someone might pick a topic and present a short (no more than 15 minute) summary. Topics may include: Records that may hold clues to locating your ancestral village?

Ted is a successful novelist and Grace, his wife of twenty years, is beautiful, stylish, carefree, and a wonderful homemaker. But what no one sees, what is churning under the surface, is Ted's rages. His mood swings. And the precarious house of cards that their lifestyle is built upon.

She finds herself in need of help but with no one to turn to\u2026until the perfect new assistant shows up out of the blue. To the rescue comes Beth, a competent young woman who can handle Ted and has the calm efficiency to weather the storms that threaten to engulf the Chapman household. Soon, though, it's clear to Grace that Beth might be too good to be true.

The Pittsburgh Fine Art Photographers Group is for photographers that have above average experience and technical skills but have wanted to raise the quality of their images equal to that of a gallery show. The Group travels around the Pittsburgh and Tri-State areas searching for photographically rich possibilities.<\/p> <p><b>CONTACT<br\/><\/b><b>Pamela Russell<br\/><\/b><b>ARTISTS\u2019 GALLERY<br\/><\/b><b>(412)[masked]<br\/><\/b><b><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><br\/><\/b><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.photosbypjr.com\/\">www.photosbypjr.com<\/a><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The Artists' Gallery is located at PJR Photography and Studio, LLC","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/227658536\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Pittsburgh Area Fine Art Photographers Gallery Exhibition","id":"hcbbllyvcbzb","time":1453246200000,"updated":1453254566000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"336 4th Ave Fl 7","name":"Tele-Tracking Technologies Inc","lon":-80.00061,"id":23703559,"lat":40.439117,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.41801357269,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424313312000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I think that due to all the changes in the REACT Ecosystem since this was originally submitted, I'll take the time to discuss the Flux and Redux architectures. \u00a0This will be a discussion on the design patterns and how they fit with REACT, in addition to how they can be leveraged outside of REACT (or even the front-end).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-JavaScript\/events\/220616658\/","yes_rsvp_count":53,"name":"ReactJS 2","id":"220616658","time":1453246200000,"updated":1453303800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364840083000,"name":"Pittsburgh JavaScript","group_lon":-79.9100036621,"id":7872022,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-JavaScript","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"JavaScript Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15207","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"563 Greenfield Avenue","name":"Hough's","lon":-79.940178,"id":14170592,"state":"Pe","lat":40.426186,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":3.07730770111,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450882405000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>RSVP on January 9 at 7pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our member,\u00a0 Kim B,\u00a0 suggested this venue and a after visiting there, I agree, it's a good fit!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are several pluses aside from the menu that include $2 beer samples and the trivia format.

We request a $5 donation from those who can give to cover costs of the meetup, but you are more than welcome to come even if you are unable to donate. Each month we set an alter, welcome in the energies, share a journey, and release the energy. You are welcome to participate in the journey planned or to do your own journey work during the time we are journeying as a group. After the journey we have a quiet time for people to record their experiences if they choose to do so and then you are given an opportunity to share if you would like to (sharing is never required). You are recommended to have basic journey skills prior to the meetup as this is not a 101 class (I will be offering the next 101 class in January).<\/p> <p>We're going to do this one a little bit differently. I will still set the space and we can build the alter and call in the directions and helpers as a group from 7-7:30. If you wish to be a part of this feel free to come in by 7. If you come in between 7-7:30, we ask that you wait in the lobby until we finish. Then at 7:30 we will begin the journey group proper. I am again going to diffuse appropriate oils for this meetup as it is still a bit dry for the smoke and we really enjoyed the oils last month. If you have an allergy or sensitivity, please let me know so I can plan accordingly.<\/p> <p>This way those who can not come until later can still take part, and we can open the alter building to all involved.<\/p> <p>The Aztec calendar for this date shows it's a good day for traveling and learning, so we're going to take the opportunity to travel to those who have helped us on the other side up to this point to get some guidance on what we should pay attention to in the upcoming year and see what else needs resolved in ourselves in order to be able to embrace that fully and live up to our fullest potentials in 2016. This is also during a thirteen day cycle where the energy encourages the transformation of poison into medicine. We intend for this gathering to be one which helps us to transform the energy of what is not helpful into energy which is.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/227831562\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"dxhtnlyvcbzb","time":1453251600000,"updated":1453824077000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.9800033569,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Volleyball Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1831 E Carson St","name":"Steel Cactus","lon":-79.979332,"id":23488720,"lat":40.428696,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.25069952011,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420355694000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Steel Cactus and Salsa412 is proud to present:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>**NOCHE LATINA!! on TUESDAYS!!**<\/p> <p>Welcome to the NEW Tuesday Latin Night Party!\u00a0<\/p> <p>You have been invited to join us on TUESDAYS to enjoy a Latin Experience at an AMAZING venue!

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

Then come tell us about it at Dobra, over a cup of new, adventurous tea!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/burghbooks\/events\/227703658\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"BYOB: Try Something New!","id":"227703658","time":1453766400000,"updated":1453834180000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1295602916000,"name":"Non-Boring Books and Beyond in the Burgh","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":1769932,"urlname":"burghbooks","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Amused Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15232","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412-621-6880","address_1":"5524 Walnut St","name":"Coffee Tree Roasters","lon":-79.932852,"id":308361,"state":"PA","lat":40.451375,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.57432723045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452879075000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you're into music, and even if you're not, here's a great opportunity to share any music you're interested in, have a cup of coffee or tea, and engage in conversation. We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists).

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/228050462\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"dxhtnlyvcbjc","time":1453856400000,"updated":1453909832000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.9800033569,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Volleyball Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"16 Castle Shannon Blvd","name":"Mt Lebanon Public Library","lon":-80.045219,"id":17606382,"lat":40.377373,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.14353275299,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451443373000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Stories, songs and rhymes for children ages birth - 2 years with an adult.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mothers-and-More-of-the-South-Hills\/events\/227708583\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Book Babies","id":"227708583","time":1453907700000,"updated":1453919712000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412271811000,"name":"Mothers and More of the South Hills","group_lon":-80.0400009155,"id":17359182,"urlname":"Mothers-and-More-of-the-South-Hills","group_lat":40.3800010681,"who":"Moms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"5467 Penn Avenue","name":"The Commonplace at Voluto ","lon":-79.933502,"id":24291612,"state":"PA","lat":40.464684,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":0.943593621254,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451710096000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\"My strength returns to me with my cup of coffee and the reading of the psalms.\"<br\/>-Dorothy Day<\/p> <p>Let's get together over coffee and biscotti and discuss some scripture at Commonplace coffeehouse on Penn street.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Catholic-Worker-Meetup\/events\/227774234\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Psalms and Lattes","id":"227774234","time":1453908600000,"updated":1453950560000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451252018000,"name":"Pittsburgh Catholic Worker Meetup","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":19243706,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Catholic-Worker-Meetup","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Workers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15260","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"University of Pittsburth","name":"2017 Cathedral of Learning","lon":-79.959,"id":5431112,"state":"PA","lat":40.444141,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.85217297077,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452519785000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Wednesday, January 27<br\/>Pat Chew: Myth of the Color-blind and Gender-blind Judge.

We started the club out as a group of people just flying for fun and now we have some serious hobbyist and commercial pilots alike. It is time we had a meeting on what the proper steps are to be completely compliant with the FAA and the easiest way to start making money flying your drone. This year the 333 exemption process for commercial flying is finally mature enough to make applying a pretty standard chore. For the first time hobbyist will also have to register their drones with the FAA. Furthermore,\u00a0I just got word that ALL drone clubs within 30 miles of DC are suspended until further notice by the FAA.\u00a0<\/p> <p>To help - Saul Ewing, a prominent Pittsburgh Law Firm has offered to host a short presentation on the latest drone rules. We will be at the Pittsburgh Tech incubator Alpha Labs Gears for this event. Tom and I will be working on getting some press for the event. Saul Ewing will be providing refreshments as well. The event is scheduled for Thursday, January 28th at 6PM. We can modify the date or time based on feedback but please RSVP this week so we know if enough people can fit this into their schedule.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This meeting will double as a registration drive so if you have friends that just got a drone or have not registered their drone we will help them with the FAA website and process before the $5 charge comes into effect.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please come out and show your support. Especially if you have already registered or currently hold a 333 Exemption it is very important that other members can talk to you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Sincerely,<\/p> <p>Micah &amp; Tom<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"There will be signs","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Drone-Masters\/events\/227746485\/","yes_rsvp_count":60,"name":"Indoor meeting \/ Drones 101 \/ Legal Update","id":"227746485","time":1454022000000,"updated":1454223881000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389204686000,"name":"Pittsburgh Drone Masters","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":11934892,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Drone-Masters","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Drone Masters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"120 S Whitfield Street","name":"Ace Hotel Pittsburgh","lon":-79.926361,"id":24261037,"state":"PA","lat":40.461346,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.38148009777,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453746963000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/9\/5\/600_446244725.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nJoin the\u00a0Young Preservationists Association\u00a0on Thursday, January 28th at\u00a0Ace Hotel\u00a0for our 2016 kick off happy hour to discuss YPA\u2019s 2016 initiatives and what YOU can do to help!<\/p> <p>We have some really exciting updates for the National Negro Opera Company House and the Allegheny Commons Pedestrian Bridge, and plans to move forward on initiatives for both Top Ten sites in 2016.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be organizing a Heart Bomb campaign in February inspired by some of our friends in Buffalo.

As the senior officer on board, first assistant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) soon realizes it is up to him to take charge of the frightened crew and inspire the men to set aside their differences and work together to ride out one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast. Meanwhile, as word of the disaster reaches the U.S. Coast Guard station in Chatham, Massachusetts, Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) orders a daring operation to rescue the stranded men. Despite overwhelming odds, four men, led by Coast Guard Captain Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), set out in a wooden lifeboat with an ill-equipped engine and little, if any, means of navigation, facing frigid temperatures, 60-foot high waves and hurricane-force winds.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDinner afterwards at:<\/p> <p>TGI Fridays<\/p> <p>5300 Corporate Dr,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Pittsburgh, PA 15237<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In the lobby of theatre after you buy your ticket.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Luvmovies\/events\/228197518\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"The Finest Hours - Movie then Dinner TGI Fridays - McCandless","id":"228197518","time":1454263200000,"updated":1454317926000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1336792767000,"name":"Pittsburgh Silver Screen Dinner & Film Group","group_lon":-79.9100036621,"id":3849892,"urlname":"Luvmovies","group_lat":40.5,"who":"Film enthusiasts."},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15234","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"466 Castle Shannon Boulevard","address_2":"Suite #203, front entrance go up the Stairs","lon":-80.033928,"phone":"412-600-1260","name":"Enlightened Healing Energy","id":23670776,"state":"PA","lat":40.372467,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.07295799255,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452138117000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The records are a library of all that you have ever done!<\/p> <p>Stephanie is going to acces your records with your permission and information from your past, present and future will be available.<\/p> <p>She will be able to answer your questions.

This is the perfect class for people who are new to journeying and want to see if it's for them or to prepare a participant for future journeying work.<\/p> <p>I will open the class with a brief history and cultural lesson and brief introduction to journey work and shamanic work. You'll get an idea of where this practice comes from, how it's come to be what it is in modern usage in America and the sorts of journeys that many people use. We'll go over the journeys that we will be doing at the event, which include:<\/p> <p>1. Journeying to meet a power animal or helper. You will need this for all of your journey work from here on out.<\/p> <p>2. Journeying for shadow work (also called inner child work or integrative psychology work). This is a chance to meet the darker nature of the self and how this came to be, to see what you need to work on healing and integrating.<\/p> <p>3. Journeying to upper world for guidance.<\/p> <p>4. Journeying to what I call your \"secret garden\" in middle world where you can refresh and grow as a person.<\/p> <p>After the introduction, we will get to the journeys. I will use different tools for each journey so you can get an idea of what these feel like. After each journey, there will be some quiet time to write down your experience, and then we will have the opportunity to share our experiences if you would like.<\/p> <p>We will also cover some of the pitfalls of journeying and some of it's dangers and how to avoid these.<\/p> <p>You will need to bring a notebook or something to write on and writing materials so that you can document your experiences for later reference. I will provide water, tea and coffee in the lobby, but snacks you are welcome to bring. There is also a middle eastern restaurant across the street that is pretty amazing if you want to catch lunch afterwards. There are chairs and a few couches in the office space, and one person is also welcome to use the massage table (if you can manage not to go to sleep on it!), but if you have special needs you may want to bring something to ensure you're accommodated properly.<\/p> <p>The event is $30 pre-registered (send payments to [masked] through pay pal) or $35 at the door. We have limited space for these events, so I do encourage you to pre-register.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you who are curious as to my qualifications and background in shamanic work, here they are:<\/p> <p>-Training in six traditions both from traditional indigenous people and from modern PhDs. The traditional teachings were done in more of an apprenticeship type work rather than in a classroom, and this training has happened in four countries.<\/p> <p>-All the markers of a shamanic path in childhood, as well as the experiences that went with it.<\/p> <p>-Education in this type of work at three universities and an academy run by practitioners.<\/p> <p>-Active membership at the Society for Shamanic Practitioners.<\/p> <p>I'm also qualified in transpersonal psychology, which I studied at two universities and one practitioner-run academy. I am currently working towards a PhD and am considering starting a new apprenticeship in medicine work next year.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/227579401\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Journeying 101 Workshop","id":"227579401","time":1454263200000,"updated":1454283240000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Carnegie Mellon University","name":"Cohon Hall ","lon":0,"id":24315420,"state":"PA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453274288000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A forum for the three Democratic candidates for US Senate will be held at CMU that afternoon at 2. \u00a0We can flyer people coming to attend the forum and set up a table in the hall. \u00a0This is a great opportunity to reach committed Democratic voters en masse. \u00a0Join us!<\/p> <p>Further instructions will be given when you sign up.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Cohon Hall is on the left as you enter CMU's main grassy entrance from Forbes","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Bernie-Sanders-Meetup\/events\/228222917\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":2700000,"name":"Bernie Goes to the Senate Forum","id":"228222917","time":1454263200000,"updated":1454275206000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436267948000,"name":"Pittsburgh Bernie Sanders Meetup","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":18724713,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Bernie-Sanders-Meetup","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Grass-roots for Bernie in Burgh"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.422.9650","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue","name":"Carnegie Library Squirrel Hill","lon":-79.922536,"id":882044,"state":"PA","lat":40.438137,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.63796234131,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450651755000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We use the book \"Japanese for Busy People\" kana version 3, first of the series.<br\/>We always meet on Sundays in the small meeting room at the Squirrel Hill Library.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meeting Room C","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JSGPITT\/events\/228010639\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"Japanese Study Group level 1","id":"hrhbnlyvcbpc","time":1454263200000,"updated":1454268803000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297574466000,"name":"Japanese Language Study Group","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":1782914,"urlname":"JSGPITT","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Japanese speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15120","country":"us","city":"West Homestead","address_1":"410 West Waterfront Drive","name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","lon":-79.919571,"id":1633037,"state":"PA","lat":40.406792,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":4.6606631279,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454044595000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Who's game for a little \"off-season\" bike ride this Sunday afternoon!?
