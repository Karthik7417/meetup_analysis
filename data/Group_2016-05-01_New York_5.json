This group is open to anyone with an open mind of course and all earth based religions. People from other locations will still find interest in this group, but to meet up with would be a challenge! I would like to start meeting up at the local venues where here in Nassau County! My local library is RVC public library, and another few venues where we can meet up are local parks, Dinners, and Bars for adult only nights. Of course we are always going to expand the venues as more meet ups are scheduled! So far we meet up once a month for individuals and or their families to come on the last Saturday of every month at the Baldwin Coach Dinner located in Baldwin on Sunrise Hwy, across from the Baldwin Train Station. Eventually I would like to make those meet ups twice a month so we can discuss possible fund raisers to light of our pockets so we can plan trips and activities. As of right now we meet once a month and come together to discuss topics of interest, problems that might be affecting you or others in the community, and sort of community service that we could suggest, and or activities, as well as future events and meetings. I would like to start children's book readings again which we will start out as once every other week and depending on the outcome we will either make it once a month or or even better would be every week! Of course with that in mind for children I would like to start arts and crafts again now that the holidays are nearing and there are many things we can plan so they can have fun!

This group is for amateur photographers who would like to improve their skills through practice and sustained self education. Why do some photographs work while some do not? How should we correctly expose a photograph? I am an amateur myself, and do not know all the answers. However, much of the enjoyment of photography is the thinking process that goes on before the shutter is clicked. We will read books, practice and most importantly teach each other as we learn. And Manhattan in all its variety will be our playground.<\/p>\n<p>My intent is to put together a group of regulars, and together we will be set ourselves on a path of self education in photography. This group is for you if (a) you have the dedication and time to devote to photography, (b) have a digital camera with manual settings, (c) open to constructive criticism of your work.\u00a0The current plan is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One meeting will be to discuss composition. I have chosen Michael Freeman's series: The Photographer's Eye. We will discuss one chapter, and take\/share photographs illustrating the materials.<\/li>\n<li>The second meeting will be to discuss exposure. This is much easier to learn, so in the future we will probably have a combination of other digital or technical issues like Lightroom.<\/li>\n<li>I'd also like to put together informal photowalks over some weekends to actually go out and practice what we learn. These plans will evolve as we come together as a group.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if you are a dedicated amateur with the time to devote and looking for similar minded people,welcome and see you all at the next meeting.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/highres_185583752.jpeg","photo_id":185583752,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/600_185583752.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/8\/thumb_185583752.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2964657,"name":"Dyutiman Das","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/f\/4\/highres_85813812.jpeg","photo_id":85813812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/f\/4\/member_85813812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/f\/4\/thumb_85813812.jpeg"}},"members":64,"name":"A Walk in Paradise Garden","id":6142972,"state":"NY","urlname":"A-Walk-in-Paradise-Garden","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Sharp Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1354833838000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"quantitative-finance","name":"Quantitative Finance","id":34637},{"urlkey":"algorithmic-trading","name":"Algorithmic Trading","id":37627},{"urlkey":"algorithms","name":"Algorithms","id":111155},{"urlkey":"trading-with-automated-trading-systems","name":"Trading with Automated Trading Systems","id":139531}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Algorithmic-Trading\/","rating":4.52,"description":"<p>NYC Algorithmic Trading is for anyone interested in creating and using algorithms in the financial markets.

What are they about? How can you as a teacher, leader, or healer best serve them?<\/p>\n<p>Secondly - the process of learning to read faces has the effect of opening the heart energy. This increases our capacity for practicing compassionate comprehension. The magic of reading faces is that it can generate deep, empathic reasoning, and this makes it possible to contain the person deeply, ie. to contain their whole being in the space of your heart. It is truly an extraordinary thing to learn and teach others this ability to understand someone deeply and completely, free of our usual habit of trying to fit someone into a preconceived box.<\/p>\n<p>The third thing that occurs when you learn to face read in this deeply empathic manner, is that you become healed yourself. You begin to understand that your experiences are shared, we are all sharing in the frailties and foibles of life with everyone around us.

Yet not taking an honest try at answering it (or even worse: ignoring the question entirely) can lead to the risk of misliving one's life. One of the main goals of ancient philosophy in the West was to help guide people in answering this question rigorously and well, and then helping people to live in accordance with their life's philosophy (literally \"the love of wisdom\").<\/p>\n<p>One of the most successful and influential schools of thought in the ancient world which addressed this question was Stoicism. Stoicism taught that by cultivating personal excellence ('<em>arete<\/em>' in Greek) was all that was needed to lead a good life and flourish as a human being ('<em>eudaimonia<\/em>' in ancient Greek). To do this, the ancient Stoics taught a host of practices and a sophisticated theory of mind to help the Stoic student on the path to <em>eudaimonia<\/em>. Stoic philosophy had a huge influence on the West, from helping shape early Christianity to being a strong influence on the modern psychological movement of cognitive-behavioral therapy.<\/p>\n<p>But Stoic philosophy is not only useful for those in the ancient world. For instance, James Stockdale has cited Stoic philosophy as helping him cope with the horrors of being a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Also, the University of Exeter in the UK has conducting pilot studies starting in 2012 of the effect of Stoic practices on various measures psychological well-being with promising preliminary results. Stoicism can be of great use to people in our modern era.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of this meetup is to introduce Stoic philosophy as a way of life to people interested in living a more meaningful, tranquil life and to support experienced students of Stoic philosophy in their practice. While many of the meetups will be focused around reading, this is not a group for disengaged study of ancient philosophy from an academic perspective. Instead, this is a group for helping people to put Stoic philosophy into practice in their daily lives, so they can live the best life they can.<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to attempt to live a more tranquil, meaningful, and happy life?

Our mission is to educate and enlighten communities about the complex history and cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines. Through the use of an artistic medium, which preserves the cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples from these regions, we seek to explore universal issues of the value of oral history, power, gender relations and environmental degradation that resonate with the current struggles of these indigenous peoples, but which also are shared concerns throughout the world. Since its founding, Kinding Sindaw has actively performed and provided cultural workshops and educational programs at venues throughout the city. These include full-scale dance-dramas: \"Irimun o Banag\", \"Agama Niyog\", \"Rajah Mangandiri\", \"Lemlunay\", \"Sultan Kudarat\", and \"Bembaran\". Venues have included La Mama ETC, Lincoln Center, The Puffin Room, Riverside Church, Mulberry Street Theatre, Wave Hill and NY area colleges. Additionally, we provide storytelling workshops at NYC area colleges, libraries (Jackson Heights Community Library) and museums (Met, Museum of Natural History, Asia Society). By presenting the rich and varied complexity of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines, we have been able to work with a variety of different community organizations and groups, and serve as a resource to help educate youth and adults.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to existing workshops, Kinding Sindaw seeks to deepen and enrich the participant\u2019s knowledge about Philippine history and culture, through a series of immersive arts and cultural workshops, led by Potri Ranka Manis, the founder and executive director of Kinding Sindaw. These workshops and classes will interweave the teaching of music, dance and martial arts movements with the history and struggles of the different indigenous tribes of the Philippines. Consequently, through this deep and active engagement, the participant will discover the tremendous significance of preserving the indigenous arts, culture, traditions and history of the Philippines, while becoming a tradition-bearer herself, capable of educating future generations and asserting her rightful place in our modern society.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/highres_196381952.jpeg","photo_id":196381952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/600_196381952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/0\/thumb_196381952.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":75408942,"name":"Angela Torregoza","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/c\/9\/0\/highres_92007792.jpeg","photo_id":92007792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/c\/9\/0\/member_92007792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_92007792.jpeg"}},"members":31,"name":"Kinding Sindaw Cultural and Arts Educational Workshops","id":6709502,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kinding-Sindaw-Cultural-and-Arts-Educational-Workshops","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Kinding Sindaw"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1358453869000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"witi","name":"Women in Technology","id":10296},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Active-Women-Starters\/","rating":4.36,"description":"<p><span><strong>Active Women Starters (AWS)<\/strong>:<\/span> <span>Active women for progress and entrepreneurship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A a group of female entrepreneurs, women in business, and their supporters worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mission statement:<\/strong> Foster women's empowerment, community, and entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Values:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Supporting each other, for all the right reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing yourself before you know others.<\/p>\n<p>Treating others with respect.<\/p>\n<p>Actively practicing true leadership.<\/p>\n<p>This group is for women and men who want to do big things, change the world, live fully, fund progress whether it be energetically or monetarily.

The group is for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Two-Spirit, and Asexual people. We aim to provide a safe, open and non-judgmental environment encouraging members to listen to each other, share experiences, interact, and learn ways to cope, heal and grow. We do this in an atmosphere of welcome, acceptance and empathy. We have our support group on the first Wednesday of the month at a West Village church in New York City. We also have our support group on the 2nd Thursday of the month at the LGBT Community Center in New York City. After both support groups, we usually get something to eat at a local diner or restaurant. We have a social get together at a Chelsea restaurant about two weeks after the Center group. We encourage members to talk from our own personal experience. We want the group to be a safe space and we stress confidentiality, as much as is humanly and realistically possible. We encourage respect, interaction, discussion and friendship, but we shy away from telling someone what they should do, and instead we give advice or feedback only if it is asked for. We discuss anxiety, depression, OCD, loneliness, relationship issues, work issues, etc. We don't guarantee answers or solutions, but we provide a space to come together to share. (This group is more for support and friendship and talking about our problems and issues; and not for professional networking nor research nor screenplays, etc. People might happen to learn ideas for jobs, but again the focus is on support and coming together.) The group is a joint effort among all members. We are not a 12 step group. We do not advocate any religion. We would like group attendance to reflect the diversity of people who join here on meetup. We have a diverse group of facilitators with respect to gender, age, and ethnicity. If people want to get more info. about the group, please e-mail at lgbtwellness411@hotmail.com. We ask for a contribution of $5, more or less, when you attend the groups, only if you can afford it, to cover the center room rental cost and the cost of being on meetup. We realize these are tough times. The most important thing is that you attend the groups, regardless of one's ability to pay. We also realize that people who attend the groups for the first time may feel awkward or nervous. We want you to feel as welcome and comfortable as is possible. No one has to talk if they are uncomfortable or nervous, but if new attendees want to share and talk about certain things, please try to let your voice and opinions be heard, and tell us what you want to talk about, and tell us what you need from the group. We can ask you if you would like to talk about anything, but we don't want to put you on the spot. This group is a joint effort, so we will do our best to include everyone. We are all learning from each other, listening, adapting, and growing.

This would include physicians, dentists, chiropractors, nurses, physician assistants, biomedical engineers, etc. Members include healthcare entrepreneurs, investors, service providers, and industry representatives. The mission of SoPE is to help biomedical and healthcare entrepreneurs get their ideas, discoveries and inventions to market by providing them with education, connections to service providers &amp; investors.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We try to hold meetings every 2 months during the academic year from 6:30 -9:30. Typically we hold meetings in mid-town Manhattan but we are also trying to arrange meetings in Connecticut and New Jersey.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meetings typically have three scheduled features: (1) networking; (2) subject presentation on business issues (e.g., finance, FDA, IP, marketing, etc.); and (3) a Company presentation by a member. We insist that at the meeting there be no solicitation of investments or business and dress code is business appropriate as one may see at a big law firm or financial services company.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Individuals may attend one meeting free as a guest of ours, after which you will be expected to join SOPE.

I am guitar teacher at the University of Pennsylvania and teach and perform in New York. I love music and have been playing and teaching for most of my life. I am starting to give group guitar classes out of my place in Crown Heights on thursdays and sundays in a fun, relaxed atmosphere. I teach and play a lot of different styles, from rock\/pop to classical, basic jazz, and Middle Eastern music. I will start with one beginner class and one intermediate. In the intermediate class I'll focus on getting people to be able to play together, solo, and pick up music by ear and follow each other. The beginner class will be teaching the very basics of guitar. Each class will be an hour long and be 25 per person, capped at 5 people. Besides these, I want to open other more specialized classes soon. You can see samples of my own music and of m teaching on my youtube channel: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V_k07cYtVwA http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DbDPoPH-ees http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IND3LJ7OHy0 Please join the group if this interests you.

I write my own music and play a lot of different styles, you can see some of my playing and teaching in these links:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y_esgphRskA<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DbDPoPH-ees<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yIFJjYwrq5w<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/b\/8\/highres_207227032.jpeg","photo_id":207227032,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/b\/8\/600_207227032.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/b\/8\/thumb_207227032.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8081156,"name":"MK","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/highres_84923682.jpeg","photo_id":84923682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/member_84923682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/thumb_84923682.jpeg"}},"members":153,"name":"Middle Eastern and Balkan music group classes with Murat","id":7284732,"state":"NY","urlname":"Middle-Eastern-and-Balkan-music-group-classes-with-Murat","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Musicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Rockville Centre","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1361477653000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"jewishparenting","name":"Jewish Parenting","id":3888},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"jewish","name":"Jewish","id":16684},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"jewish-social","name":"Jewish Social","id":17818},{"urlkey":"jewish-families","name":"Jewish families","id":51818},{"urlkey":"jewish-and-interfaith-families","name":"Jewish and Interfaith Families","id":81948},{"urlkey":"parents-of-toddlers-and-preschoolers","name":"Parents of toddlers and preschoolers","id":130770},{"urlkey":"jewish-moms-playgroups","name":"Jewish Moms Playgroups","id":144260},{"urlkey":"celebrate-shabbat","name":"Celebrate Shabbat","id":144712},{"urlkey":"raising-jewish-children","name":"Raising Jewish Children","id":164989},{"urlkey":"celebrate-jewish-holidays","name":"Celebrate Jewish holidays","id":283791},{"urlkey":"young-jewish-families-expecting-young-couples","name":"Young Jewish Families\/ Expecting Young Couples","id":385911},{"urlkey":"jewish-baby","name":"jewish baby","id":411332},{"urlkey":"jewish-kids","name":"jewish kids","id":411342},{"urlkey":"jewish-families-with-young-children","name":"Jewish Families with young children","id":1382362}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Young-Jewish-Families-Together-in-Nassau-County\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p>This is a group for Jewish families in the area that want to connect with each other and get together to celebrate holidays and Shabbat.

Kundalini Yoga is a Yoga of Awareness, so in this group we will approach yoga with a new and fresh look at Kundalini Yoga practice. Whether you are a new or seasoned practitioner, come and joins us and explore this ancient practice. It is for anyone searching for complete Union of Being: physical, mental, spiritual! It is for every body, age, physical ability. It meets you where you are at and takes you where you want to go!<\/p>\n<p>Master the basis: Long deep breathing, breath of fire, eye focus, \"the locks\", mantra pronunciation and meaning, postures and mudras.<\/p>\n<p>The Kundalini Energy is awareness itself. It organizes all the other energies in the body. If its flow is open and correct, healing results occur with almost miraculous impact. Our fears and attachments often disturb the normal flow of energy and functioning of the first three chakras. When that flow is opened and reconnected to the higher centers, the nervous system, glands and chakras all synchronize.

written.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Mission:<\/strong> <span>The<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsymphony.org\">New Westchester Symphony Orchestra<\/a> <span>(NewWSO) offers amateur instrumental musicians in and around Westchester County an opportunity to build musicianship in a supportive, non-competitive setting while practicing and performing significant orchestral and ensemble works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Who Can Play:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsymphony.org\">NewWSO<\/a> is an <em>audition-free ensemble<\/em> for musicians of all ages and abilities. Anyone who wants to play great works of orchestral literature can do so with us. When possible, we play from the exact same editions that the great orchestras of the world play from. So, next time you hear the first movement of Mozart's 40th Symphony being played on WQXR, you will recognize your part and say, \"Hey, I can play that...sort of!\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Conductor:<\/strong> Conductor Benjamin Niemczyk is understanding, patient, and brings us together in the spirit of making great music. There are more than a few wrong notes here and there and he doesn't yell at us, we just keep trying. So come play with us no matter how long it's been. No need to brush up before playing with us, our friendly musicians will make you feel right at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rehearsals and Concerts:<\/strong> We rehearse weekly and we play concerts in the community approximately once per month. Don't sweat either one, we're a relaxed bunch and know that people are busy. Just rehearse and perform when you can. Concerts are always volunteer, we don't make you perform. Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsymphony.org\">our website<\/a> for much more info on who we are, what we play, and where we play.<\/p>\n<p><span>Join us at any one of our weekly rehearsals to check us out. You may not see many RSVPs here because most of our members are not on Meetup. You will walk into a room of 35-45 musicians when you come. Everybody is very friendly and welcoming, so don't be too shy. Just come!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What instruments do we need?<\/strong> Currently we have openings for following instruments:<\/p>\n<ul> \n <p>Oboe<\/p> \n <p>Bassoon<\/p>\n <p>French Horn<\/p> \n <p>Violin<\/p> \n <p>Viola<\/p> \n <p>Cello<\/p> \n <p>Bass<\/p> \n<\/ul>\n<p>If you play flute, clarinet, trumpet, percussion, or piano, contact us regarding available spots as we may have a waiting list. That being said, if you play these instruments but also play another instrument or are willing to learn another instrument, we won't turn you away. We welcome musicians who have an adventurous spirit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are a pro:<\/strong> We are an all-volunteer ensemble whose musicians do not get paid to perform, nor do we pay \"ringers\" to play with us. If you're a professional musician or a really awesome amateur and want to play with us, that's great! But we don't pay in cash, let's just get that out of the way. Your payment will be the great feeling of playing with a group of enthusiastic music lovers, and a little fame if that's your thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NewWSO is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization<\/strong> and is a \"pay to play\" ensemble. Your first rehearsal is free of charge, to see if you like the repertoire and the people. If you decide to join, we ask for a contribution of $10\/rehearsal OR a pro-rated annual contribution to cover rehearsal space rental and administrative costs. However, if a financial contribution is not possible for you, we can work something out. Please let us know your situation and we are more than happy to accommodate in a way that is fair for everyone.<\/p>","lon":-73.7799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/c\/highres_223696812.jpeg","photo_id":223696812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/c\/600_223696812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/c\/thumb_223696812.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10469270,"name":"Belinda","photo":{"photo_id":101132822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/3\/6\/member_101132822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/3\/6\/thumb_101132822.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"New Westchester Symphony Orchestra","id":7412702,"state":"NY","urlname":"NewWestchesterSymphony","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":41.0299987793,"who":"Musicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1362168576000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"ruby-on-rails","name":"Ruby On Rails","id":20837},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Techsocially\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p>The techsphere is exploding in the New York \/ New Jersey Area, but most tech events revolve around speakers and presentations.

This is not a \"group play-along\" type meetup but rather one which teaches the member their own set of playable songs.<\/p>\n<p>Our own experiences tell us that learning specific songs as a small group promotes quicker learning than practicing on your own.&nbsp; Group work encourages the student to learn at their optimum level. Moreover, actually learning to play songs as finished products results in a rewarding experience.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/4\/1\/highres_435944609.jpeg","photo_id":435944609,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/4\/1\/600_435944609.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/4\/1\/thumb_435944609.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2692105,"name":"Tim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/4\/1\/0\/highres_101570192.jpeg","photo_id":101570192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/4\/1\/0\/member_101570192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/4\/1\/0\/thumb_101570192.jpeg"}},"members":86,"name":"MetroJersey Novice Guitarists Workshops","id":7426742,"state":"NJ","urlname":"MetroJersey-Novice-Guitarists-Workshops","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Performers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1362261745000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"piano","name":"Piano","id":1659},{"urlkey":"people-who-love-to-sing-with-piano","name":"People Who Love to Sing with Piano","id":48824},{"urlkey":"beginner-piano","name":"Beginner Piano","id":66035},{"urlkey":"adult-amateur-pianists","name":"Adult Amateur Pianists","id":72850},{"urlkey":"adult-professional-pianists","name":"Adult Professional Pianists","id":86424},{"urlkey":"piano-lessons","name":"piano lessons","id":93127},{"urlkey":"piano-playing-for-adult-beginners","name":"Piano playing for Adult beginners","id":500842}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LetsMeetupAndPlayPiano\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>This group is for adult piano students of all levels.

The aim of creating this group is to understand Islam in the light of Quran and the teachings of the Holy Prophet(p.b.u.h) and his family, God willing\/inshAllah, to gain the pleasure of God and seek nearness to Him. Let's educate ourselves about the beauty of Islam and bring it deeper into our lives. Islam is the religion of knowledge, it is a guide to the straight path from darkness into the light. The first aayah of the Qur\u2019an to be revealed enjoined reading which is the key to knowledge. God\/Allah (SWT) says: \u201cRead! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not\u201d [al-\u2018Alaq 96:1-5] Islam calls us to seek knowledge. The Prophet (PBUH) made seeking knowledge an obligation upon every Muslim. The Prophet of Allah (saaw) was asked: \u201cWhat is Knowledge?\u201d He replied: \u201cto keep silent\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto listen attentively\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto remember\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto act upon (what is learned)\u201d. He was asked: \u201cThen?\u201d He said: \u201cto propagate\u201d. [Al-Majlisi, Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, p. 28] There is no goodness in knowledge which is not confirmed by action, or words which are not confirmed by deeds:Allah says: \u201cO you who believe, why do you say what you do not do? It is most hateful to Allah for you to say what you do not do.\u201d [S\u00fbrah al-Saff: 2-3] So let us learn Islam : the perfect way of life and and bring it into our deeds and actions.

The best source of new business is from referrals; and it is our belief that referrals are the best way of expanding your business. Ask yourself, are you more confident doing business with a company who was recommended by a friend, a family member, a colleague or customer? Getting a recommendation from an associate means they had a positive experience doing business with a company. Wouldn\u2019t you want to be the business that was recommended? The Business Circle Network value is that of relationship building, upon making a new connection you will include them in your Circle of Business Network; enabling you to leverage your Network and make an appropriate business introduction. We will meet monthly to form new business relationships and nurture existing relationships with the goal of building a powerful network of long lasting business

If it was a bubble bursting, can regulation prevent bubbles?<\/p> \n <p>Is it reasonable to expect people in government to be so much smarter than the market that they can accurately perceive bubbles and take corrective measures before the market has figured out that a bubble is happening?<\/p> \n <p>Ben Bernanke says that the bond market currently overestimates the government's willingness to bail out a big bank in the future, and he says the government now has tools to wind down a large organization that didn't exist in 2008. Should we believe him?<\/p> \n <p>Some types of regulation are clearly bad. What types of regulation are good?<\/p> \n <p>Do we need banks that are big enough to pose systemic risk? Or should we impose a \"systemic risk tax\" to penalize banks for being too big, so that they will voluntarily split themselves into smaller organizations?<\/p> \n <p>Is growing inequality a problem if poverty is not increasing and median income is not declining?<\/p> \n <p>Which is the worse sin: greed or envy?<\/p> \n <p>Incumbents usually want stimulus, while the opposition usually screams bloody murder about the deficit. Should we opt for more stimulus now, or austerity, or are we currently making the right trade off?<\/p> \n <p>You may love or hate Obamacare, but everyone agrees it won't do anything to contain our country's rampant medical inflation. What should be done to address this problem?<\/p> \n <p>Economic Liberals, like those who run the Tenement Museum on the LES, often point to conditions in the 19th century and claim \"that is where unbridled capitalism would take us\". How did people's living conditions in the 19th century compare to their living standards before that? Do we owe our improved standard of living to politicians, union organizers, and regulators, as these people would claim, or to the inventors and industrialists who made dramatic increases in productivity possible?<\/p> \n <p>Dodd-Frank: pros and cons?<\/p> \n <p>The cost of college has been increasing much faster than inflation. The \"US News and World Report\"'s annual ranking of colleges actually <em><strong>rewards<\/strong><\/em> schools for spending more money per pupil. Many students are graduating so far in debt they are unlikely be debt-free before they are 30. This whole problem undermines social mobility. Why is this happening and what can be done about it?<\/p> \n <p>China's gradual adoption of market reforms after the death of Mao and the discrediting of the Soviet economic model around 1990 have made market economics the only game in town. This has brought a flood of good news from economies that 20 years ago were deemed hopeless. Living standards in China and India have increased dramatically, and there are 3 cellphones for every four Africans.<\/p> \n<\/ul>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/highres_214336682.jpeg","photo_id":214336682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/600_214336682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/a\/thumb_214336682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2341848,"name":"Bill","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/3\/f\/a\/highres_251601498.jpeg","photo_id":251601498,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/3\/f\/a\/member_251601498.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/3\/f\/a\/thumb_251601498.jpeg"}},"members":178,"name":"Fans of Capitalism","id":7645202,"state":"NY","urlname":"Fans-of-Capitalism","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1363466408000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dotnet","name":".NET","id":827},{"urlkey":"consultant","name":"Consulting","id":915},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"ip-telephony","name":"IP Telephony","id":46498},{"urlkey":"unified-communications","name":"Unified Communications","id":65684},{"urlkey":"microsft","name":"Microsoft","id":88327},{"urlkey":"microsoft-technology","name":"Microsoft Technology","id":99537},{"urlkey":"microsoft-exchange-server","name":"Microsoft Exchange Server","id":113483},{"urlkey":"unified-messaging","name":"Unified Messaging","id":113486},{"urlkey":"microsoft-lync","name":"Microsoft Lync","id":134367},{"urlkey":"overview-of-office-365-features-and-functionalites","name":"Overview of Office 365 features and functionalites","id":311481},{"urlkey":"office-365-users-group","name":"Office 365 Users Group","id":387711},{"urlkey":"lync","name":"Lync","id":465662},{"urlkey":"office-365","name":"Office 365","id":483322},{"urlkey":"microsoft-office-365-public-cloud-based-technology","name":"Microsoft Office 365 public cloud-based technology","id":543292}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJ-Unified-Communication-User-Group\/","rating":4.74,"description":"<p><span style=\"color : #000080 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>All Our events are hosted via MS LYNC now.

Our first accomplishment \u2013 though rather small, was giving a meager sum to the roundstarfoundation.org as two coaches went and set up clinics to coach kids and also teachers who want to lead community teams in<\/span> <span>Zimbabwe<\/span><span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are building our charity work as Beautiful Game grows. So we ask for $2 donations per game to cover our costs.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meetup is a great website that connects all of us soccer lovers but in case you did not know. It is not free. Meetup charges $45 every 3 months to use it. Simple math= 3 months, goes into 12 months, 4 times. That\u2019s $180 per year to use Meetup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We also provide top quality gear. We play with 6 foot Pugg nets, cones, a kick-ass (pun intended) FIFA authentic Bola Official ball of Brasil ($150) and not so world class bibs. We hope to get nicer bibs in the future.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We want to keep our current schedule of Mon-Wed-Fri<\/span> <span>1pm<\/span> <span>kickoffs but I'm not able to make it every time as I have coaching scheduling conflicts some days. So Mpande is running the Meetups on the days I can't. And he will set up the pitch so you can all play, but also, he will be collecting. Please don\u2019t make him beg for a dollar. He truly does this for the love of the game, but lugging 6 foot goals on the subway is no fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If your attitude is like \u2018F*ck this shit no way I\u2019m paying for pickup soccer in NYC!\u2019 that\u2019s cool there are many other soccer Meetup groups. But if you are like I like what they do, but have no job, hence I play soccer in the middle of the day during the work week, and I can\u2019t afford $2- talk to us and that is cool. We understand. It\u2019s all about helping those that could use it.

Come to these meetups to learn how you can help yourself and others by knocking out the anxiety that underpins habits that damage our minds and bodies. You will learn to tap acupuncture points on your face, hands and body to instantly collapse panic attacks, overwhelming negative feelings, and self-sabotaging beliefs. You don't need to talk about that abusive event you survived. You don't need to re-live a disaster. Tapping works on the sub-verbal level, which is why it also works on people who cannot communicate (maybe because of a language barrier -- or maybe they're in a coma). Tapping works on infants and animals too. Sounds too good to be true? Join this group. Skeptics are my favorite people to work with because they keep me honest and are my strongest supporters when they experience this form of healing for themselves.<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/highres_335176502.jpeg","photo_id":335176502,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/600_335176502.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/7\/6\/thumb_335176502.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":83186772,"name":"Janelle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/1\/6\/highres_158711542.jpeg","photo_id":158711542,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/1\/6\/member_158711542.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/1\/6\/thumb_158711542.jpeg"}},"members":245,"name":"Tapping for Happiness, Inner Peace and Courageous Living","id":8105012,"state":"NY","urlname":"Tapping-for-Happiness-Inner-Peace-and-Courageous-Living","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Life Changers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1366221947000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"coworking","name":"Coworking","id":14990},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"start-ups","name":"start-ups","id":130937},{"urlkey":"co-working-space","name":"Co-working Space","id":328491}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startup-Staten-Island-Tech-Meetup\/","rating":4.85,"description":"<p>Tech, startups, coworking, maker spaces and a whole new entrepreneurial culture has grown and evolved throughout New York City.

Oath Keepers is a non-partisan association of currently serving military, reserves, National Guard, peace officers, fire-fighters, and veterans who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic \u2026 and meant it.<\/p>\n<p>We won\u2019t \u201cjust follow orders.\u201d Below is our declaration of orders we will NOT obey because we will consider them unconstitutional (and thus unlawful) and immoral violations of the natural rights of the people. Such orders would be acts of war against the American people by their own government, and thus acts of treason. We will not make war against our own people. We will not commit treason. We will defend the Republic.<\/p>\n<p>Declaration of Orders&nbsp;<span>We Will NOT Obey<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Recognizing that we each swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and affirming that we are guardians of the Republic, of the principles in our Declaration of Independence, and of the rights of our people, we affirm and declare the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>1. We will NOT obey any order to disarm the American people.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The attempt to disarm the people on April 19, 1775 was the spark of open conflict in the American Revolution. That vile attempt was an act of war, and the American people fought back in justified, righteous self-defense of their natural rights. Any such order today would also be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason. We will not make war on our own people, and we will not commit treason by obeying any such treasonous order. Nor will we assist, or support any such attempt to disarm the people by other government entities, either state or federal. In addition, we affirm that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to preserve the military power of the people so that they will, in the last resort, have effective final recourse to arms and to the God of Hosts in the face of tyranny. Accordingly, we oppose any and all further infringements on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. In particular we oppose a renewal of the misnamed \u201cassault-weapons\u201d ban or the enactment of H.R. 45 (which would register and track gun owners like convicted pedophiles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>2. We will NOT obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles, papers, or effects \u2013 such as warrantless house-to house searches for weapons or persons.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the use of \u201cwrits of assistance,\u201d which were essentially warrantless searches because there was no requirement of a showing of probable cause to a judge, and the first fiery embers of American resistance were born in opposition to those infamous writs. The Founders considered all warrantless searches to be unreasonable and egregious. It was to prevent a repeat of such violations of the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects that the Fourth Amendment was written. We expect that sweeping warrantless searches of homes and vehicles, under some pretext, will be the means used to attempt to disarm the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>3. We will NOT obey any order to detain American citizens as \u201cunlawful enemy combatants\u201d or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the denial of the right to jury trial, the use of admiralty courts (military tribunals) instead, and the application of the laws of war to the colonists. After that experience, and being well aware of the infamous Star Chamber in English history, the Founders ensured that the international laws of war would apply only to foreign enemies, not to the American people. Thus, the Article III Treason Clause establishes the only constitutional form of trial for an American, not serving in the military, who is accused of making war on his own nation. Such a trial for treason must be before a civilian jury, not a tribunal. The international laws of war do not trump our Bill of Rights. We reject as illegitimate any such claimed power, as did the Supreme Court in Ex Parte Milligan (1865). Any attempt to apply the laws of war to American civilians, under any pretext, such as against domestic \u201cmilitia\u201d groups the government brands \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d is an act of war and an act of treason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>4. We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d on a state, or to enter with force into a state, without the express consent and invitation of that state\u2019s legislature and governor.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the attempt \u201cto render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power\u201d by disbanding the Massachusetts legislature and appointing General Gage as \u201cmilitary governor.\u201d The attempt to disarm the people of Massachusetts during that martial law sparked our Revolution. Accordingly, the power to impose martial law \u2013 the absolute rule over the people by a military officer with his will alone being law \u2013 is nowhere enumerated in our Constitution. Further, it is the militia of a state and of the several states that the Constitution contemplates being used in any context, during any emergency within a state, not the standing army. The imposition of martial law by the national government over a state and its people, treating them as an occupied enemy nation, is an act of war. Such an attempted suspension of the Constitution and Bill of Rights voids the compact with the states and with the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>5. We will NOT obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact by which that state entered the Union.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In response to the obscene growth of federal power and to the absurdly totalitarian claimed powers of the Executive, upwards of 20 states are considering, have considered, or have passed courageous resolutions affirming states rights and sovereignty. Those resolutions follow in the honored and revered footsteps of Jefferson and Madison in their Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, and likewise seek to enforce the Constitution by affirming the very same principles of our Declaration, Constitution, and Bill of Rights that we Oath Keepers recognize and affirm. Chief among those principles is that ours is a dual sovereignty system, with the people of each state retaining all powers not granted to the national government they created, and thus the people of each state reserved to themselves the right to judge when the national government they created has voided the compact between the states by asserting powers never granted. Upon the declaration by a state that such a breach has occurred, we will not obey orders to force that state to submit to the national government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>6. We will NOT obey any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the blockade of Boston, and the occupying of that city by the British military, under martial law. Once hostilities began, the people of Boston were tricked into turning in their arms in exchange for safe passage, but were then forbidden to leave. That confinement of the residents of an entire city was an act of war. Such tactics were repeated by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, and by the Imperial Japanese in Nanking, turning entire cities into death camps. Any such order to disarm and confine the people of an American city will be an act of war and thus an act of treason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>7. We will NOT obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Mass, forced internment into concentration camps was a hallmark of every fascist and communist dictatorship in the 20th Century. Such internment was unfortunately even used against American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II. Whenever a government interns its own people, it treats them like an occupied enemy population. Oppressive governments often use the internment of women and children to break the will of the men fighting for their liberty \u2013 as was done to the Boers, to the Jewish resisters in the Warsaw Ghetto, and to the Chechens, for example. Such a vile order to forcibly intern Americans without charges or trial would be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason, regardless of the pretext used. We will not commit treason, nor will we facilitate or support it.\u201dNOT on Our Watch!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>8. We will NOT obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d or to \u201cmaintain control\u201d during any emergency, or under any other pretext.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war. During the American Revolution, the British government enlisted the aid of Hessian mercenaries in an attempt to subjugate the rebellious American people. Throughout history, repressive regimes have enlisted the aid of foreign troops and mercenaries who have no bonds with the people. Accordingly, as the militia of the several states are the only military force contemplated by the Constitution, in Article I, Section 8, for domestic keeping of the peace, and as the use of even our own standing army for such purposes is without such constitutional support, the use of foreign troops and mercenaries against the people is wildly unconstitutional, egregious, and an act of war. We will oppose such troops as enemies of the people and we will treat all who request, invite, and aid those foreign troops as the traitors they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>9. We will NOT obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, under any emergency pretext whatsoever.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of the causes of the American Revolution was the seizure and forfeiture of American ships, goods, and supplies, along with the seizure of American timber for the Royal Navy, all in violation of the people\u2019s natural right to their property and to the fruits of their labor. The final spark of the Revolution was the attempt by the government to seize powder and cannon stores at Concord. Deprivation of food has long been a weapon of war and oppression, with millions intentionally starved to death by fascist and communist governments in the 20th Century alone. Accordingly, we will not obey or facilitate orders to confiscate food and other essential supplies from the people, and we will consider all those who issue or carry out such orders to be the enemies of the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>10. We will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There would have been no American Revolution without fiery speakers and writers such as James Otis, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, and Sam Adams \u201csetting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.\u201d Patrick Henry: \u201cGive me Liberty, or Give me DEATH!\u201d Tyrants know that the pen of a man such as Thomas Paine can cause them more damage than entire armies, and thus they always seek to suppress the natural rights of speech, association, and assembly. Without freedom of speech, the people will have no recourse but to arms. Without freedom of speech and conscience, there is no freedom. Therefore, we will not obey or support any orders to suppress or violate the right of the people to speak, associate, worship, assemble, communicate, or petition government for the redress of grievances. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually affirm our oath and pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. Oath Keepers The above list is not exhaustive but we do consider them to be clear tripwires \u2013 they form our \u201cline in the sand,\u201d and if we receive such orders, we will not obey them. Further, we will know that the time for another American Revolution is nigh. If you the people decide that you have no recourse, and such a revolution comes, at that time, not only will we NOT fire upon our fellow Americans who righteously resist such egregious violations of their God given rights, we will join them in fighting against those who dare attempt to enslave them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>NOTE: please also read our Principles of Our Republic We Are Sworn to Defend<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Oath Keepers is a non partisan association of currently serving military, peace officers, fire-fighters, and veterans who will fulfill our oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, so help us God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our oath is to the Constitution, not to the politicians, and not to any political party. In the long-standing tradition of the U.S. military, we are apolitical. We don\u2019t care if unlawful orders come from a Democrat or a Republican, or if the violation is bi-partisan. We will not obey unconstitutional (and thus unlawful) and immoral orders, such as orders to disarm the American people or to place them under martial law. We won\u2019t \u201cjust follow orders.\u201d Our motto: \u201cNot on Our Watch!\u201d or to put it even more succinctly, in the words of 101st Airborne Commander General Anthony McAuliffe at the Battle of the Bulge, \u201cNUTS!\u201d There is at this time a debate within the ranks of the military regarding their oath. Some mistakenly believe they must follow any order the President issues. But many others do understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution and to the people, and understand what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The mission of Oath Keepers is to vastly increase their numbers. We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our own troops.

We learn tools to balance and understand the emotions, to listen to the body and to heal any imbalances in the body and emotions and soul.

Some are professional glamour models, pin up girls, college students, fetish models, topless bartenders, go-go\/berlesque dancers, dominatrix, business executives and even housewives. These ladies all love to be photographed and they are all young, beautiful Gotham Girls living, working and existing in this great gritty city.

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR BEGINNER OR INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS. We sometimes like to go out for beer afterwards. We like players who pass the ball and don't slide tackle. We just like to have fun and meet new people. If this sounds like you, come play!<\/p>\n<p>We use the following rules in our group to make it fair for everyone:<\/p>\n<p>1) Play can be quite fast and aggressive, but friendly. If the ball goes out, call it out even if the other team gets the throw in. Don't argue about every goal. Sometimes you fall down or get kicked, but do not foul. We ask repeat offenders to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p>2) We have no waiting list for games. If a game fills up, you can only jump on a spot if someone cancels. Anyone can come to the game to see if a spot is open, but if it is full, sorry.<\/p>\n<p>3) COME ON TIME. If you are not ready to play at the scheduled start time, you cannot play. If someone is there to play on time, they get your spot. Even if no one else is there to take your spot, you can't play if you come late. We are serious about this.<\/p>\n<p>4) No shows prevent other people from playing, so always cancel as early as possible if you can't make it. WE TAKE THE RSVP LIST ONE HOUR BEFORE THE GAME - AFTER THAT IF YOU CANCEL YOU ARE CONSIDERED A NO SHOW. If you are a no-show multiple times, you will be removed from the Meetup group. This is so that other people can have time to rsvp yes if you cancel.<\/p>\n<p>5) If you play, play the entire scheduled game. It is not fair to people on the waiting list or your teammates if you leave early. We will remove you from the group if you a repeat offender.<\/p>\n<p>6) We'll collect payment in cash at the start of every game. Bring exact change! We use this to get pinnies, cones, goals, better balls, and to pay our monthly Meetup fee.<\/p>\n<p>7) Our pinnies are currently red and neon green. Please do not wear a red, yellow or neon green shirt to games.<\/p>\n<p>See you on the pitch!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3981826,"name":"Maria S","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/highres_117551512.jpeg","photo_id":117551512,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/member_117551512.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/thumb_117551512.jpeg"}},"members":1183,"name":"Friendly Brooklyn Pickup Soccer","id":8417222,"state":"NY","urlname":"Friendly-Pickup-Soccer-in-Brooklyn","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Futboleros"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1368124862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ai","name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":456},{"urlkey":"ixd","name":"Interaction Design","id":10110},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"computer-science","name":"Computer Science","id":21751},{"urlkey":"high-scalability-computing","name":"High Scalability Computing","id":24410},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"user-research","name":"User Research","id":49541},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"human-computer-interaction","name":"Human-Computer Interaction","id":71162},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"mobile-user-experience","name":"Mobile User Experience","id":122974},{"urlkey":"deep-learning","name":"Deep Learning","id":1456952}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACM-NY\/","rating":4.69,"description":"<p><span>ACM New York City is a non-profit professional group that meets regularly to discuss diverse topics in computer science such as user experience, user research, data visualization, predictive analytics, applied machine learning, statistical modeling, open data, and artificial neural networks.

You don't need to be a vegan to join, and, no, the books are not vegan-based! This is not a political group, just a group of smart people who like to discuss books over good food. We incorporate a wide variety of genres, from science fiction to classics to comedy to metafiction--we strive for diversity in our literary selections! Interested persons should note, however, that this is a fiction group; we do not read biographies or poetry or investigative journalism or other forms of non-fiction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>I do not charge a fee for this book club to cover organizer fees--something many groups do. Your monetary contribution comes from bringing a delicious vegan-friendly dish to share. Not all members are vegan and people do occasionally bring dishes with dairy or honey--just please be sure to note it so that members who may have allergies or who are strictly vegan are aware of this. Also, I am gluten-free and always appreciate gluten-free dishes! But that's not at all a requirement of the potluck.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I want this meetup to be an active group with regular attendees. Because of this, the group has a two strikes rule. If you RSVP and don't show to two events without canceling your RSVP, you will be removed. Also, I believe it is better to have a smaller group of active members than a huge list of inactive members and have decided to cap membership at 100. If you have been inactive for over six months you might be removed to make room for other more active members.

As we continue to bring a non-judgemental awareness to our lives and say YES to how it shows up, we watch our lives expand in every direction - career, finances, creativity, communication, plus our marriage is sweeter, closer and more fun than ever before.

Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!

At one meeting we feature member competitions in black-and-white prints, color prints and digital images, at the beginner, advanced and salon levels. Our second monthly meeting consists of lectures, demonstrations, discussions, or activities, such as a studio night. These programs are designed to help the members learn the basics of photography, new techniques for taking pictures, or applications of photography. We also organize field trips to photogenic sites, and a year-end banquet and competition. There are many benefits to joining RPS, such as the right to enter competitions, attend field trips and becoming better photographers. You are cordially invited to come to any of our meetings without becoming a member. However, in order to enter images into our competitions, you must be a dues-paying member.

People pose for photos, stop for a chat to ask what we're about, or just give a warm smile or laugh while passing by. Messages are hand painted\/drawn onto signs made by each individual or small group and generally include messages like, \"You're beautiful!\" \"I love it when you smile.\" \"Follow your love, follow your dreams.\" \"Free hugs.\" \"You are love.\" You get the point. We'll meet in different locations around the city where there's a considerable amount of space and foot traffic. We'll meet and share a moment of silence or meditation before and after the event to open and close. We'll start with around hour long meetups. Hindu, Christian, Atheist, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, people from all religious faiths and from no religion are welcome to gather in community to share these secular positive messages. It's a really nice way of meeting other like minded positive people around the city and I guarantee it will leave you feeling happier and more connected.
