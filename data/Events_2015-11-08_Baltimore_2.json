These meditation sessions are secular and available to anyone wishing to meditate. All experience levels are welcome. During this session, I'll be offering 4 rounds of 10 to 15 minutes of Shamatha Meditation (also known as Calm Abiding, or Mindfulness meditation). If you are new to meditation and you would like to discuss the technique one on one, please send me a message, and we can schedule time before meditation to go over the technique. After the meditation session we discuss the meditation experience, and also take in select readings from a variety of meditation masters. The focus on most of our reading sessions is about using what we learn in meditation in every day life situations.

We'll begin by gathering there for a pre-war drink (or two) before walking four blocks over to the tug-of-war zone and the Tugfest street festival. Our mission at Tugfest is to eat, drink, observe, cheer, have a good time, and wander around Eastport soaking up its ambience.<\/p> <p><b>Our SHR group will NOT be tugging in the war!<\/b><\/p> <p>The tugging part is done by organized teams that register and pay a fee to participate.<\/p> <p><b>The Tug-of-War Contest<\/b><\/p> <p>Each year, the MRE professes its independence with a challenge to the City of Annapolis to meet on the high seas of the Gulf of Eastport. The tug-of-war contest is popularly known as \"Slaughter Across the Water\".<\/p> <p><i>Time: \u00a0Crack 'O Noon until 5:00 pm<\/i><\/p> <p>This late-fall rite of passage includes multiple tug competitions held across the Gulf of Eastport (aka Spa Creek). Tug teams represent businesses, service organizations, and anyone else feeling the need to \"tug it out\".<\/p> <p>They're positioned on opposite sides of Spa Creek at City Dock on the Annapolis side and at Second Street and Severn Avenue on the Eastport side. A special tug rope is draped across the water for the teams to grab and pull with all their collective strength. When a marker on the tug rope passes the mid-point of Spa Creek, the match is finished. Nobody gets pulled into the water, although the cheering crowds clearly lust for it.<\/p> <p><b>The Tugfest Street Fair<\/b><\/p> <p>Tugfest is a street festival held right where the tug-of-war participants fight it out on the Eastport side of Spa Creek. There are food and drink vendors so you can watch the action while eating, drinking, and listening to live music.\u00a0Admission is free.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/5\/e\/600_439554110.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/d\/b\/600_439553979.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Why We Support the Maritime Republic of Eastport<\/b><\/p> <p>The Maritime Republic of Eastport (MRE) stands for everything that's great about America -- Independence!

Here is a much better and faster route:<\/p> <p>From Rt. 50\/301 Eastbound, take the Arris T. Allen\/MD 665 exit (exit 22) and stay straight on MD 665. After about a mile, the road name changes to Forest Drive. Keep going on Forest Drive and turn left onto Hilltop Lane.<\/p> <p>Follow Hilltop Lane (which changes name to Tyler Ave.) straight to Bay Ridge Ave. Turn left onto Bay Ridge Ave. and follow it as it turns onto Chesapeake Ave. \u00a0Follow Chesapeake Ave. and turn right on 4th St. to Chester Ave. Davis' Pub is on the corner of 4th and Chester Ave.<\/p> <p>The Eastport neighborhood has several one-way streets, so check the Google map above on the meetup notice to see how to get there.

But this read just isn't a very spooky read (if you know what I mean) while the Club Pick was. So I figured do this one before Halloween and the Club Pick on Halloween. Hope this works out.<\/p> <p>Summary<i>: Hailed as \"one of the best writers in the business\" by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, multi-award-winning author Maggie Osborne delivers hilarious and heartrending tales of resilient women full of grit, pride, and dignity who shine through hard times. Now meet the most irresistible and independent heroine of them all, a woman called Low Down, who never had anything good happen to her until the day she asked for the one thing that only a man could give her. . . .<\/i><\/p> <p><i>As scruffy and rootless as the other prospectors searching for gold in the Rockies, Low Down wanted nothing in return for nursing a raggedy bunch through the pox. But when pressed to reveal her heart's wish, she admits, \"I want a baby.\" Not a husband, not a forced marriage to the proud man who drew the scratched marble and became honor bound to marry her. To be sure, Max McCord was easy on the eyes, but he loved another woman and dreamed of a different life. Yet they agreed to a temporary marriage that could end only in disaster.

Everything is a path to our awakening. Come breathe yourself into the present moment and let go of the misery and shame keeping you from being more joyfully alive. Unlike many sacred traditions, Tantra uses our sexual energy as a powerful tool to expand. Learn to deepen your delight, open your heart and invite more ecstasy and bliss into your relationship with yourself and others. Find the transcendent in the body just waiting to be discovered. Sherry creates a safe, well boundaried and playful atmosphere as she shares simple techniques for greater intimacy, pleasure and spiritual opening. The All Love guided meditation will be offered along with Tantra techniques to move and share energy. Adult discussions will be held.
