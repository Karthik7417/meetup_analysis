This is one of our favorite walking locations on the South Shore. \u00a0We will be meeting and walking from the Braintree side of PMP. \u00a0One of the great things about walking at PMP is there are some shady areas along with some nice breezes once in awhile. \u00a0We should have some nice Fall Foliage to enjoy today as well! \u00a0Let's meetup and get to know each other while walking around the pond!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPond Meadow Park consists of a paved loop as well as paved walkways to and from both sets of parking lots. \u00a0This path is hilly with some flat terrain. \u00a0If you choose to head out into the woods the trails are marked but not paved. \u00a0The loop is 1.6 miles, with the walk to and from the parking lot it is 1.9 miles. It takes about 35-40 minutes to walk the loop. If we walk the loop twice it's a total of 3.5 miles and takes between 1 hr and 1 hr and 15 minutes, depending on pace. If we walk to the street of the Weymouth entrance it adds .4 miles and takes about 5-10 minutes.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe will\u00a0walk\u00a01-2 loops today, possibly adding in the Weymouth entrance stretch. \u00a01 loop plus that stretch will net us 2.5 miles in about 45-55 minutes. \u00a02 loops will net us 3.5 miles in about 1 hr and 10-20 minutes, and 2 loops plus that stretch will net us 3.9 miles in about 1 hr and 15-30 minutes. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>A Few Items to Keep In Mind:<\/p> <p>Your Yes RSVP means you will be attending and we are expecting you so please be courteous and change your RSVP prior to the RSVP deadline if you are no longer able to attend.<\/p> <p>Pace: Today our walking speed will be approximately[masked]mph.\u00a0 The first loop will be\u00a0approximately[masked]mph for a leisurely pace for some and an average (or even fast) pace for others.\u00a0 We will speed it up closer to[masked]mph on the 2nd loop for more of a fitness walk for most. \u00a0If a \"slower\" walker wants to co-host or lead a group on a \"slower\" pace for the 2nd loop then the[masked]mph speeds will be done together the first half of the first loop and then the fast walkers can speed up for the remaining 1&amp;1\/2 loops to[masked]mph and the slower walkers can maintain their pace. \u00a0*Please be respectful of our paces today.\u00a0 I will keep us on pace and slow or speed us up periodically as needed.*<\/p> <p>Attendees: Open to all female members and their guests age 21+ only. \u00a0No males or pets please.<\/p> <p>This is weather-dependent. \u00a0<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>Sunday Morning South Shore Womens Walk @ Pond Meadow Park<\/b><br\/><b>Sunday,\u00a0November 1st @ 9:30am ~ Don't Forget to Turn\u00a0Your Clocks Back One Hour the Night\u00a0Before!\u00a0 (This will\u00a0feel like 10:30am!)<\/b><br\/>Pond Meadow Park<br\/>470 Liberty Street, Braintree<br\/>[masked] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br\/>Website: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pondmeadowpark.org\">www.pondmeadowpark.org<\/a><br\/><i>Meeting Location<\/i>: Flagpole in front of Ranger Station<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Event Host(s)\/Organizer(s)<\/i>: Angela &amp; Jodi Griffith<\/p> <p><i>Min\/Max<\/i>: At least 6 Yes RSVPs 48 hours prior to the event. \u00a0There is no maximum for this event at this time.<\/p> <p><i>Guests<\/i>: 1 female adult per member is welcome.<\/p> <p><i>Late Arrivals<\/i>: We will wait our traditional 5-10 minutes for late arrivals.<\/p> <p><i>Cost\/Fees:<\/i>\u00a0 There are currently no costs or fees associated with this event. \u00a0PMP does have some donation bins if you so wish to do so. \u00a0If you want to make your annual voluntary contribution to Social Fun I will be happy to collect and mail it to Biagio.<\/p> <p><i>RSVP Deadline:<\/i> <b>Please finalize your RSVP by\u00a08:30 AM\u00a0on Sunday, November 1st.<\/b> \u00a0<b>Any changes made after this time may not be seen by an Event Organizer prior to the event and are subject to our No-Show policy.<\/b> \u00a0The Event Organizer(s)\/Host(s) reserves the right to cancel this event if we have less than 6 Yes RSVPs at the RSVP Deadline.\u00a0 While we have access to \u00a0email to see any last-minute changes, the RSVP Deadline is when we print the RSVP List and\u00a0is the last time we may be on the website.<\/p> <p><i>Inclement Weather<\/i>: Heavy rains and\/or temps below 45 will cancel.

I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous.

Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb! \u00a0If you are looking for a partner, or just want to get your climb on, join us for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to toprope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. This meetup assures you'll meet a partner to climb with.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test.

Join our Meetup group! All cooking levels are welcome. Don't be shy.<\/p> <p>2. RSVP via Meetup. Note :: Each of our \"feast\" events will happen the 1st Sunday of every month, focusing on a different cookbook, and hosted at a new location in the North Shore. Everything will be organized by me, but you're more than welcome to offer suggestions of some of your favorite cookbooks.<\/p> <p>3. Grab yourself a copy of the featured cookbook<b> (ask your library, borrow from a friend, order online or purchase at a local retailer)<\/b> and experiment with a few of the recipes.<\/p> <p>4. Read through the cookbook + pick 1 recipe that you will make for the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>5. <b>In the comments section below<\/b>, share which recipe you will be bringing. Note :: It might be wise to pick a backup recipe in case your 1st choice is already taken.<\/p> <p>6. Day of the event. Prepare your recipe according to the directions provided in the cookbook. Source ingredients locally, if you can. As tempting as it might be to alter the recipe or make a substitution, please follow the instructions as closely as possible. This will allow the group to truly experience the author's array of recipes.<\/p> <p><br\/>7. At the feast we will be eating family style with the food on a separate buffet table. Feel free to present your recipe on a nicer platter or bowl . . . it makes for a great photo opp.<\/p> <p><br\/>8. Come to the event with an open mind + empty stomach!

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

Lured by the promise of America, Eilis departs Ireland and the comfort of her mother\u2019s home for the shores of New York City. The initial shackles of homesickness quickly diminish as a fresh romance sweeps Eilis into the intoxicating charm of love. But soon, her new vivacity is disrupted by her past, and Eilis must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within. With a screenplay by Nick Hornby (About a Boy, An Education, Wild) based on the novel by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and an outstanding performance by Ronan that has already been deemed \u201cOscar-worthy,\u201d BROOKLYN is sure to be a cinematic highlight of the season. Don\u2019t miss your opportunity to see it first!<\/p> <p>This screening is free and open to the public. No pass is required and seating will be distributed on a first-come-first-sat basis.

We will have the game set up on the 1st floor unless we see a ton of you RSVP then we will move it to the 2nd (would need to know by Saturday). After this weekend we have a ton of one and four o'clock games apart from the two Thursday night games. The \"Packers Boston\" hats have arrived here at the pub, as a little promotion I will give away ten this Sunday night to the first ten Packers that come into the pub. If you can't make it in this weekend I will also give away ten for the Panthers game on November 8th. I have a limited amount of this \"first batch\" (which I will mostly give away to you guys) just to make sure the group is happy with them.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

However, this free Usui Reiki Level 1 attunement is given remotely by Mr. Irmansyah Effendi by means of Reiki Tummo attunement techniques, so the result is somehow better than traditional Usui Reiki attunement results.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For more detail information about the difference between Usui Reiki and Reiki Tummo attunement results, please use your yahoo email address to sign in to this group web page (<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\"><a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups<\/a><\/a>) and then visit the file section of this group or click:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/<\/a><\/a> and the file name is: AttunementComparisonUsuiReikiTummo.gif<br\/>You are welcome to explore and study other drawings there and put questions on this list.<\/p> <p>For more detail information about Reiki Tummo You can also buy Reiki Tummo book (\"REIKI TUMMO: An Effective Technique For Health and Happiness\" is written by the founder and Grandmaster of Reiki Tummo, Irmansyah Effendi, MSc.) at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/\">www.amazon.com<\/a> (ISBN:[masked])<\/p> <p>Since it is given by means of Reiki Tummo attunement technique, the result is very good for cleansing your crown chakra, heart chakra as well as palm chakras and energy channels. All alumni of Reiki Tummo workshops from Padmacahaya or Padmajaya are entitled to join and receive this free mass attunement as Reiki Tummo attunement (because you already received one before).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please read the instruction below on DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION. Also since the main benefit of the attunement is to help your heart get better connection to Divine Love and Light so your heart can be opened and cleansed better by Divine Love and Light then we suggest you to also do OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION daily before and after the attunement. Please read more information below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>May you enjoy and get benefit from this mass attunement.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Much Love and Light for your beautiful hearts, :)\u00a0<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION<br\/>Note: No need to register in advance, just be ready during the attunement.<\/p> <p>WHAT TO DO FOR A DISTANT ATTUNEMENT<\/p> <p>1. You do not need to register to receive this free mass attunement of Usui Reiki Level 1. Just prepare your self at the day of the attunement (1st of each month)\u00a0<br\/>2. No need to adjust your local time any longer. The attunement has been programmed to be received every 1st of each month at 6.30 PM YOUR OWN LOCAL TIME, where ever you are, for 15 minutes duration.\u00a0<br\/>3. Please study how to do Self Healing\/Treatment with Reiki. You can find this in some web pages or in some Reiki books. You do need to do self healing right away after the attunement is finished to make good use of the attunement energy flow that is still working on you even though the attunement is over already. Please see Note below for suggested hand positions during self healing.\u00a0<br\/>4. On the attunement day, try to get a room where you will not be disturbed. The attunement will take about 15 minutes. It is best to have a room in which the light is not too bright. If possible, have new age music and incense or aroma therapy ready. Dim light and music will help you to get relaxed easily. The incense or aroma therapy will be needed to neutralize the negative energy that will come out of you during the attunement. Remember the attunement is also a cleansing process.\u00a0<br\/>5. About 30 minutes before the attunement, it is good to start doing simple and light exercises that move most parts of your body, but don't make yourself exhausted. Simply do exercise for about 30-60 seconds for each part of the body. This will help energy flow even better in your physical body layer.\u00a0<br\/>6. Since the attunement will help opening your heart connection to Divine energy, then for better result, we suggest you to do Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation after doing simple exercises. That can be done about 15 minutes before the attunement. Please read more information on Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation below.\u00a0<br\/>7. After the simple exercises and Open Heart Prayer, get relaxed, dim the light, and turn the music on. Light incense before the attunement starts. Sit on a chair; try to keep your spine straight without forcing it. Make sure that your legs are not crossed and it is better if both feet are grounded. Put both of your hands on your thighs with your palms facing upwards. Please don't fall asleep during the attunement! :)\u00a0<br\/>8. During the attunement, simply relax. Do not make any effort to concentrate. Do not practice any breathing technique. Try to be as still as possible and enjoy whatever happens. It is a good practice to always relaxed, smile at your heart and surrender to Divine Source of Love and Light during the attunement. Also be willing to open your heart to Divine Source to receive more Divine Love and Light during the attunement. It is all done by intention only and then relaxed, smile and enjoy the attunement process. DO NOT EXPECT anything to happen since this will make you are not relaxed anymore :)\u00a0<br\/>9. After the attunement, do a complete self-healing directly. Take your time and do it properly and enjoy with smile and happy feeling from your heart all the time.\u00a0<br\/>10. After self-healing, try to do the same simple exercises you did before the attunement to help your physical body absorb Reiki energy better.<br\/>11. Keep on doing self healing for at least 21 days. It is best to do it every day even after you pass the 21-days period to maintain your health and improve your energy. Also, since the main benefit of channeling Reiki energy is to open and cleanse our heart, then it is always better to do Open Heart Prayer also every day to cleanse and keep our heart open better for Divine Love and Light.<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0<br\/>1) Suggested hand positions for channeling Reiki energy during Self Healing are (3 minutes per position sequentially):\u00a0<br\/>FRONT OF THE BODY: Forehead\/face, Cheeks, Throat, Upper chest, Lower chest, Stomach, Thighs, Knees, and Ankles<br\/>BACK OF THE BODY: Back of the head, Nape of the neck, Upper back, Lower back\/waist, Buttocks, Back of thighs, Calves and Soles of the feet\u00a0<br\/>2) More detail and complete techniques about doing healing and other Reiki techniques will be taught in Reiki Tummo workshops. Visit www.padmacahaya.com or www.padmacahaya.org for more information.<br\/>3) Please feel free to share your experiences after the attunement and doing Self Healing for 21 days and Open Heart Meditation every day.<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION<br\/>(By Irmansyah Effendi)<\/p> <p>Each time we have negative emotion, we leave \/ deposit negativities within our heart. How many time a day we have negative emotions, even though we do not show them. To cleanse the heart further (bigger and deeper), the best way is to ask for blessing from the True Source of Love and Light.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Before you start this prayer, you may need to write down the name of the people you don't like (you need to forgive), and for what you need to ask for forgiveness. You can replace the terminology \u201cTrue Source\u201d with any other terminology which you are more comfortable with \/ can relate better to.<\/p> <p>STEPS:<br\/>(Follow your feeling while praying)<br\/>1. Touch your heart (center of your chest) with 1 or 2 fingers<br\/>2. Close your eyes<br\/>3. Relax<br\/>4. Smile<br\/>5. Smile to your heart sweetly and freely<br\/>6. Feel the nice feeling from your heart, smile and stay within that nice feeling along the prayer<br\/>7. Pray (from the heart with feeling and love):\u00a0<br\/>1) True Source, please bless our heart so that all arrogance be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>2) True Source, please bless our heart so that all selfishness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>3) True Source, please bless our heart so that all anger be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>4) True Source, please bless our heart so that all envy and jealousy be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>5) True Source, please bless our heart so that all greediness and cunningness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>6) True Source, please bless our heart to understand that peace, calmness and joy are better than negative emotions. We have to let go of all negative emotions toward others, so that You can bless our heart, to fill our heart with Your Love and Light, peace, calmness and joy. Please bless and help us to be able to forgive everyone sincerely.<br\/>{Now, forgive everyone sincerely, although the same person has been doing the same negative things repeatedly and is still doing it. Remember that keeping negative emotion in you will simply give you pressure and burdens.}<br\/>7) True Source, as we have forgiven everyone else, please bless our heart so that all hatred, sadness, resentment, disappointment and other negative emotions, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>8) True Source, please bless and help us to realize that You are All Loving and All Forgiving. Please bless and help us to realize all of our mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.\u00a0<br\/>{Now, realize all of your mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.}<br\/>9) True Source, as You have forgiven all of our mistakes, please bless our heart and whole being so that all fear, worry, and burdens because of those mistakes, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>10) True Source, please bless and help us to be able to stay within our heart, within Your Love and Light, to always be peaceful, calm, and joyful.<br\/>11) True Source, thank You for all of Your blessing, Love and Light.<br\/>12) Amen.<\/p> <p>Note:<br\/>a. Since the most important benefit of Reiki attunement for our heart is to open and connecting our heart better to Divine Love and Light to cleanse our heart further, so for better results of Reiki attunement on your self and heart, it is suggested to do this Open Heart Prayer prior to receiving the attunement (say starting 2 weeks daily before the attunement) and every day after the attunement.\u00a0<br\/>b. The Open Heart Prayer CD in English or Indonesian language is available for purchase.\u00a0<br\/>c. More techniques and practice on opening and activating your heart can be learnt through Open Heart Workshop from Padmacahaya.

A brilliant, showy, roof-raising overture, followed by three masterpieces, all in completely different styles and making staggering demands on the players.\u00a0 At the center of the program is Debussy\u2019s beloved\u00a0La mer.Debussy\u2019s score is the iconic French orchestral masterpiece of the twentieth century, ever-fresh, beloved, endlessly imitated by other composers. It is the ultimate orchestra seascape \u2013 quintessentially French and as salty as they come.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Debussy is surrounded by Russian masterworks, both familiar and unfamiliar. Stravinsky\u2019s Violin Concerto is a work that overflows both with tenderness and wit. It is astoundingly virtuosic for the performer, who must negotiate instrumental acrobatics that are far outside the normal arsenal of a virtuoso\u2019s technique. We are extremely fortunate to have as our soloist the brilliant Ayano Ninomiya, who is first violin of the world-famous Ying Quartet. The familiar and exhilarating Overture to\u00a0Ruslan and Ludmila\u00a0opens the program, and to conclude, the Tchaikovsky Fifth Symphony, a great favorite with audiences and known to just about everybody. But Mr. Zander\u2019s take on the piece is bracing and fresh.\u00a0 He has performed it many times, in many parts of the world, and always audiences are stirred by the experience of having the familiar made new again.<\/p> <p><b>No need to purchase any tickets for this event, it is completely free and we are seating on a first come first serve basis!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>*If you have any questions please call the box office at[masked] or email\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"After entering the Hall, please turn right and I'll try to be at the opposite wall.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226164459\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"zjbtllytpbdb","time":1446508800000,"updated":1446521454000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.73765230179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435257950000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the monthly business meeting of SpeakOUT.<\/p> <p><br\/>All members are invited to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you want a copy of the agenda beforehand, contact [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SpeakOUT\/events\/226153151\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Monthly SpeakOUT Board Meeting","id":"ghlwhlytpbfb","time":1446508800000,"updated":1446517835000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391592871000,"name":"SpeakOUT","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":12729592,"urlname":"SpeakOUT","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Speakers & Other Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brookline","address_1":"872 Commonwealth Ave","name":"7-Eleven ","lon":-71.114693,"id":22976962,"state":"MA","lat":42.350853,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.3728518486,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440421990000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Luke continues the story of the Lord in the Book of the \"Acts\" of the Apostles. \u00a0The cross isn't the end of the story--the resurrection is really the beginning! \u00a0Join us for an exciting study of what the Lord does next in the newly established Kingdom of God.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The study will be located in the upper level dining area in the BU West Campus 7-Evelen","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Bible-Study\/events\/226150712\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Study Acts","id":"smmfklytpbdb","time":1446508800000,"updated":1446521452000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1349362969000,"name":"Boston Bible Study","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":5239222,"urlname":"Boston-Bible-Study","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"763 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 7","name":"The Breathing Room","lon":-71.105568,"id":8576222,"state":"MA","lat":42.366524,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":1.87491583824,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435871761000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a weekly meeting where pregnant women and couples come to gain new insights about childbirth choices and issues that affect pregnancy and overall health. \u00a0Hear from birth experts ranging from midwives and doulas to registered nurses, educators and holistic healthcare practitioners.

Considering the novel's enduring success, it is remarkable that it began merely as a whim of Lord Byron's.<br\/>\"We will each write a story,\" Byron announced to his next-door neighbors, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her lover Percy Bysshe Shelley. The friends were summering on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland in 1816, Shelley still unknown as a poet and Byron writing the third canto of \"Childe Harold.\" When continued rains kept them confined indoors, all agreed to Byron's proposal.<br\/>The illustrious poets failed to complete their ghost stories, but Mary Shelley rose supremely to the challenge. With \"Frankenstein, \" she succeeded admirably in the task she set for herself: to create a story that, in her own words, \"would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group\/events\/226052643\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"LITERATURE AND LIBATIONS - Frankenstein by Mary Shelley","id":"226052643","time":1446508800000,"updated":1446521448000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246242470000,"name":"Cambridge Book Club","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1481208,"urlname":"Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02145","country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"6 Vernon St.","name":"Vernon Street Studios","lon":-71.1017,"id":1529380,"state":"MA","lat":42.391178,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.69976139069,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1394424692000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come draw some dynamic poses with us at Damon's studio- we do shorter poses here, 5 minutes to start, and ranging through 10, 20, and 30 minute poses.\u00a0 Informal setting in Damon's painting studio, surrounded by his paintings and work in progress.<\/p> <p>You can pay online in advance when you RSVP, and save time for drawing during the session. \u00a0Please customize the amount you're paying online according to whether you've paid your membership this month or not ($10 for members, $25 for a one-time drop in- which can be converted to a membership should you come back that same month).\u00a0You may also pay your $25 monthly membership when that comes due each month online either together with the payment for the drawing session or separately through the link to the left on the sidebar.<\/p> <p>Parking is on-street legally for two hours for people without Somerville parking permits, BUT WE PREFER THAT YOU PARK IN THE LOT AROUND BACK, WHICH IS OPEN PAST 11PM. \u00a0The building is a working factory, so the lot is monitored and safe, though it is a bit of a walk around the building to the front door.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"corner of Central Street and Vernon Street, big brick building.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/226205472\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytpbdb","time":1446510600000,"updated":1446568415000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02474","country":"us","city":"Arlington","phone":"781-316-0282","address_1":"369 Mass Ave","name":"The Arlington Center","lon":-71.14869,"id":684061,"state":"MA","lat":42.412078,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.40302991867,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441660916000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\"What\u2019s wrong with me?\"\u00a0 Insecurity, doubt, self-hatred and other good stuff.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

They are leveraging the concept of swarm creativity, where this small team - the Collaborative Innovation Network (COIN) - empowered by the collaborative technologies of the Internet and social media, turns their creative labor of love into a product that changes the way how we think, work, or spend our<br\/>day.<\/p> <p>The presentation introduces the concept of coolhunting, finding new trends by finding the trendsetters, and coolfarming, helping the trendsetters getting their idea over the tipping point. It describes dozens of case studies done with companies around the world, analyzing the new idea creation process through tracking human<br\/>interaction patterns on three levels.<\/p> <p>This Tuesday November 3rd, your Boston Network Users Group, BNUG, will meet at Mass Bay Community College in Wellesley Hills.

Gloor is a Research Scientist at the Center for Collective Intelligence at MIT's Sloan School of Management where he leads a project exploring Collaborative Innovation Networks (COIN). He is also Founder and Chief Creative Officer of software company galaxyadvisors where he puts his academic insights to practical use, helping clients to coolhunt by analyzing social networking patterns on the Internet \u2013 spot the next big thing by finding the trendsetters, and to coolfarm \u2013 make the cool trends succeed on online social networking sites.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/226247540\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Open Cards and Board Game Night in Medford","id":"226247540","time":1446593400000,"updated":1446673956000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"438 Somerville Avenue","name":"Cambridge Hackspace @ P.irateship","lon":-71.10244,"id":24079947,"state":"MA","lat":42.381321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.22099041939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440949966000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Spend some time on your project by bringing it along to our weekly project night, an evening designed around you and what you're working on.<\/p> <p>This weekly event is about finding time to tinker, being creative, and meeting other members of the community. \u00a0You'll get the chance to see what others are working on, share your projects, and to get inspiration and feedback from fellow tinkerers.<\/p> <p>On any given Tuesday night you have people working on\u00a0electronics, knitting, writing code, wood-working, or just their plans for world domination.

Starting a company without carefully considering some important co-founder questions and issues can significantly undermine your company\u2019s chances of success. What questions should you consider when dividing the initial equity? What do you need to do to ensure the company\u2019s ownership of IP? How do you protect your company and your investors if a co-founder stops working or leaves the company?<\/p> <p>To answer these questions, our panel will discuss start-up formalization using founder agreements. These agreements define each team member\u2019s roles and responsibilities as they will appear in legal filings. Equity ownership and vesting will be addressed as will the impact of unequal founder initial investment. Another essential aspect of technology start-ups is intellectual property (IP) ownership. Will some of the founders bring IP with them to the new venture? If so, IP ownership and licensing issues must be settled.<\/p> <p>These are just a few of the issues our panel of experienced experts will address on November 3rd.

Fiddlers, guitarists, banjo players, and all kinds of folks rambled those early roads, learning from each other, inspiring each other, and pushing the music in new directions. Music constantly switched back and forth across the racial divide, beholden only to the beat and the dance. It\u2019s this fevered period of musical exchange that inspires Northwest roots music duo Ben Hunter &amp; Joe Seamons. The songs on their new album, Take Yo Time, tap into everything from the hokum jug bands of Gus Cannon and the Memphis Sheiks, to country blues masters Reverend Gary Davis, Robert Johnson, and Blind Willie McTell. They also touch on ancient English ballads like House Carpenter, Appalachian murder ballads like the classic Tom Dooley, and the early jazz compositions of Shelton Brooks and Duke Ellington. All of these traditions are tied together in the swirling musical whirlpool of pre-war American music. With a well-rosined fiddle and an old banjo, Ben Hunter &amp; Joe Seamons are tracing these backroads, bringing the songs back to life.<\/p> <p>Ben and Joe have been playing together for almost 5 years, the last 3 of which sent them to the Port Townsend Acoustic Blues Festival, learning at the feet of the elders of the acoustic blues tradition. They found an affinity in the many branches that tied into the blues and created this duo as a way to explore these branches. Their musical kinship and sense of joy in interpreting this music is evident and was the basis of an invitation Dom Flemons (formerly of the Carolina Chocolate Drops) to form his band when he went solo. Ben and Joe joined Dom on his recent album, Prospect Hill, and toured the US with him, furthering their knowledge of Anglo and African American music traditions. Rather than thinking of their music as blues, it\u2019s best to situate Ben and Joe (and Dom) as American songsters. A songster traditionally refers to an African-American artist whose repertoire is much broader than the old blues, and spans many of the genres that Ben and Joe Inhabit. Big Bill Broonzy and Mississippi John Hurt are classic examples of songsters. Whatever you want to call it, Ben Hunter &amp; Joe Seamons make American music. They make music that hews to the rough-and-tumble collisions of musical inspirations from the early 20th century; music that paved the way for everything we enjoy today.<\/p> <p><b>Elijah Wald &amp; Sandrine Sheon <\/b><br\/>Elijah Wald is a guitarist and singer whose repertoire ranges from old blues and folk songs to ragtime, swing, and classic Swahili pop. After an apprenticeship studying guitar and drinking till dawn with Dave Van Ronk, he has played all over the US, as well as Europe, India, and the Congo. He worked as an accompanist to Eric Von Schmidt, played for five years with the legendary African-American fiddler and mandolinist Howard Armstrong, studied with the Congolese masters Jean-Bosco Mwenda and Edward Masengo, and has recorded an instructional DVD on the music of the Bahamian virtuoso Joseph Spence.

It's clear we have hit a nerve both within and outside of our community. There is still much more work to do. The support for this effort is growing daily and coming from some interesting and unexpected places.<\/p> <p>We have held several meetings to obtain feedback...and will continue to collaborate to refine the presentation and Next Steps.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to secure our fair share of the economic pie for both Black businesses and residents. Our next public presentation of Freeze Frame will be done... at a community meeting on Wednesday, November 4th, 2015, 6:00-9:00 PM, Prince Hall Grand Lodge, 24 Washington St, Grove Hall. Save-the-date and invite everyone! We want to fill the house. Just another way to communicate that we're serious!<\/p> <p>For those of you who could not attend on September 30, you should know that we discussed two very exciting initiatives that are included in the enclosed Next Steps. We're creating a Massachusetts Black Chamber of Commerce (\"MBCOC\"). Equally exciting, we're creating a Black Political Action Committee (\"BlackPAC\") to focus financial support and create accountability to elected officials who support our goal of real economic inclusion for Black businesses and Black residents of our community and Black communities across the state. Just this past weekend, we secured our first PAC commitment from a Black business in Worcester. Same issue, different zip code! We set a goal of raising $100,000 in founding member commitments by the end of this month through $5,000 commitments and $1,500 commitments for the under 45 entrepreneurs. We are close to achieving our goal!<\/p> <p>We encourage you to consider being a founding member by making your BlackPAC commitment by October 25th. We'll be announcing the final tally at the November 4th meeting. Remember, as a result of the Citizens United vs. FEC, corporations can make PAC donations.<\/p> <p>We will continue to keep you updated on the progress. We respect your time and attention because we know that you are busy. So when we call on you, know that it is because your presence is important. WE need you on November 4th.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/3\/8\/600_443656440.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonOnyxbirds\/events\/226447100\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Freeze Frame: Black Boston 2015, A Case For Inclusion","id":"226447100","time":1446678000000,"updated":1446689772000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1197747806000,"name":"Boston \"Onyxbirds\" Travel Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":877771,"urlname":"BostonOnyxbirds","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Onyxbirds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston ","address_1":"50 Milk St., 16th Floor Kitchen ","name":"CIC Boston","lon":-71.058884,"id":24133317,"state":"MA","lat":42.360081,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.568543732166,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446220786000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The partners of the Caf\u00e9 des Entrepreneurs are glad to welcome Mr. Eric Stevenson, Director for the Americas of Aldebaran Robotics.<\/b> Mr. Stevenson will be interviewed by Fran\u00e7ois Ducroux, former head of the French-American Chamber of Commerce of New-England (FACCNE).\u00a0<br\/><i>\u200bPresentation in English.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/7\/600_443615447.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<br\/><b>Eric Stevenson<\/b> is Director for the Americas for Aldebaran Robotics. leading sales and operations for the US and Latin American region.

The leader (Bob Barnes) of the Wedeln Ski and Snowboard Race Team will hold dryland training every Wednesday night this Fall. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer. Bob's enthusiasm for skiing and training is contagious, he will get you working hard and getting results. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat. Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for the ski season.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/5\/600_10414789.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. Darlene Stokes and Tom Lane will also lead the group in additional exercises designed to increase flexibility and build a strong core. Last year we had many people from Meetup join us for these workouts. Some even became regular guests up at our ski house in NH. Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. The workouts last 1.5 hours and are always immediately followed by a few drinks and sometimes some food at a variety of Waltham Center Bars\/Restaurants. Please wear work-out clothes and athletic shoes with some ankle support.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/f\/9\/600_10414809.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet in the center of Waltham common near the flag poles.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wedelns\/events\/225082693\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Pre-season ski fitness training","id":"lrxgklytpbgb","time":1446679800000,"updated":1446691262000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1189913538000,"name":"Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":687583,"urlname":"Wedelns","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Wedelns"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Southborough","address_1":"25 Main St","name":"Southborough Public Library","lon":-71.530029,"id":22549382,"lat":42.305801,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.8421192169,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446588268000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Don't miss this wonderful opportunity to share in the journey of two local entrepreneurs.\u00a0 Exciting opportunity to be apart of the conversation and idea building as a group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join in this exciting opportunity to talk with Ravi of QEDrones.com about drones and how they work with aerial photography, STEM teaching and much more\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SouthboroughEDC\">Southborough EDC\u00a0@SouthboroughEDC<\/a><\/p> <p>See you tonight! <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Krosslinkorg\">@Krosslinkorg<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SouthboroughLib\">@SouthboroughLib<\/a> Ella Eaton Room, 6:30pm!

Our final hour is for the presentation: Bridging the Data Divide - Mapping JSON and XML to Objects in iOS Software (Objective-C)<\/p> <p>Speaker: Steve Caine<\/p> <p>Most mobile apps have a requirement to access data from remote web services in order to present information derived from that data to users. To support multiple hardware platforms, text-based encodings of this data for transmission are generally preferred over binary formats. Among these, the most common are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language). But then this text must be translated back into binary data for use by the apps\u2019 software, generally using object-oriented languages such as C++, Objective-C, or Java. Sending data back to web services requires a reverse translation.<\/p> <p>Common problems generally lead to common solutions. A search on \u2018json xml\u2019 on GitHub.com (home to a vast trove of all kinds of open-source software) returns over 1,800 repositories offering solutions to this challenge.

We socialize and enjoy refreshments until about 7:15, at which point the speakers presents for as long as they choose, usually until 8:00 or so. At this point we pass the mic around and have a group discussion about the topic. When the discussion wraps up, we continue with more refreshments and socializing until around 9:00 when all attendees are welcome to join our open steering committee meeting.<\/p> <p>We \u00a0take donations at the door to cover the cost of the meeting ($5 is suggested). Half of the donations (after we pay the rent) are given as an honorarium to the speaker. All regular attendees are encouraged to bring refreshments to share.<\/p> <p>Note that we have a large mailing list outside of Meetup.com so the RSVP numbers are generally much lower than the actual attendance.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The entrance to the Hall is around to the right side if you are facing the Meeting House front doors.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ConcordAreaHumanists\/events\/222494683\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Marie M.

They found an affinity in the many branches that tied into the blues and created this duo as a way to explore these branches. Their musical kinship and sense of joy in interpreting this music is evident and was the basis of an invitation Dom Flemons (formerly of the Carolina Chocolate Drops) to form his band when he went solo. Ben and Joe joined Dom on his recent album, Prospect Hill, and toured the US with him, furthering their knowledge of Anglo and African American music traditions. Rather than thinking of their music as blues, it\u2019s best to situate Ben and Joe (and Dom) as American songsters. A songster traditionally refers to an African-American artist whose repertoire is much broader than the old blues, and spans many of the genres that Ben and Joe Inhabit. Big Bill Broonzy and Mississippi John Hurt are classic examples of songsters. Whatever you want to call it, Ben Hunter &amp; Joe Seamons make American music. They make music that hews to the rough-and-tumble collisions of musical inspirations from the early 20th century; music that paved the way for everything we enjoy today.<\/p> <p>The songs on their new album, Take Yo Time, tap into everything from the hokum jug bands of Gus Cannon and the Memphis Sheiks, to country blues masters Reverend Gary Davis, Robert Johnson, and Blind Willie McTell. They also touch on ancient English ballads like House Carpenter, Appalachian murder ballads like the classic Tom Dooley, and the early jazz compositions of Shelton Brooks and Duke Ellington. All of these traditions are tied together in the swirling musical whirlpool of pre-war American music. With a well-rosined fiddle and an old banjo, Ben Hunter &amp; Joe Seamons are tracing these backroads, bringing the songs back to life.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/folksongboston\/events\/226162334\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Ben Hunter and Joe Seamons house concert","id":"226162334","time":1446683400000,"updated":1446695660000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1433279683000,"name":"Folk Song Society of Greater Boston","group_lon":-71.1800003052,"id":18644563,"urlname":"folksongboston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":11.8151302338,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445179346000,"fee":{"amount":35,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/0\/8\/event_137851752.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us for an evening shooting in around Boston Harbor with help and advice from Ian.<\/p> <p>The workshop will run from 7.30pm and will end around 11pm (you may leave sooner if you need to).<\/p> <p>The class will be limited to just 8 and there will be a $35 charge.<\/p> <p>You will need a tripod and a cable\/shutter release (the self timer is not a\u00a0suitable option).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/3\/4\/event_137852052.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Learn how to make darkness look like daylight and how to make the darkness look really black.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

At ACT.md, our design team encountered this in a dramatic way: Massachusetts law requires that a patient's authorization for sharing health data include specific call-outs for (really) sensitive conditions, and our application's authorization agreement\u2014shown front-and-center during user enrollment\u2014had to comply. This show-and-tell talk will share the best practices and assumptions behind our patient authorization design, plus our experiences testing it with patients and families.<\/p> <p><b>About Jonathan.<\/b>\u00a0Jonathan Abbett is Director of User Experience at <b>ACT.md<\/b>, a Boston healthcare startup with user experience as its foundation. He has spent his entire career in healthcare, designing and building software for patients, care providers, and researchers at <b>Boston Children's Hospital<\/b>, <b>Massachusetts General Hospital<\/b>, <b>Harvard Medical School<\/b>, and the <b>Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research<\/b>. With a background in computer science, Jonathan is also passionate about strengthening the designer-developer relationship and encouraging UX designers to lead software teams.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>4.

The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks this year on the the night of November 5. The second quarter moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year. If you are patient, you may still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

It really inspired me, to have all those voices sounding as one, voicing the words of inspired musicians. I have yearned to create a local song circle ever since that time. Since my musical abilities are not aligned with leading a song circle, I just kept hoping someone would come along to lead. Getting to know Carolyn over time I became aware of her extraordinary qualities as a song leader. Eventually, one day, I asked, would you like to lead a song circle? I'll organize. We can hold it here. And, voila... we set up our first SpiritSong Circle here in Stow.

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, meditation combined with breathing techniques, key phrases (or mantra) can help you work through these. These tools will help to eliminate symptoms altogether or at least help them to occur less frequently. Meditation also helps to facilitate healing within the body and through meditation, we allow our minds to be quieted, our bodies to be calm and relaxed. In our busy day-to-day living, finding moments like this are rare. Please join me for a one hour guided meditation and sacred breathwork class to learn some easy techniques that you can apply at home, in the office - or anywhere where you can find a quiet moment.

This one is going to be a little darker than usual but just as fun.<\/p> <p>Silent Servant\u2019s prolific output as a producer and artist has laid the groundwork for much of the most ambitious and forward thinking electronic music of today. As a member of the now defunct Sandwell District, he helped force the hand of change with uncompromising ability. And still, he continues to do so with even greater strength and success.<\/p> <p>No time has been wasted in the wake of Sandwell District\u2019s 2011 demise. Along with Regis and James Ruskin, Silent Servant founded the Jealous God label. In it\u2019s short existence, they have already cut-up and reinterpreted many of the conventions of the techno world, forging a unique identity in the process. With it\u2019s highly conceptual aesthetic and relentless dedication to experiment, Jealous God is a flag-bearer for the contemporary electronic avant-garde and a loyal ally to all mutant experimentalists. Along with Jealous God, Silent Servant produces and curates for the Downwards imprint, which, throughout it\u2019s 20 year history, has continued to remain at the forefront of the underground techno world. Inherently obscure, their operation is indirect, and easily they deceive introspection. Consciously working as outsiders and avoiding club lavishness, they earn their respect with less mercy than the hyena his food. While insincerity remains the safety of many, Silent Servant\u2019s own productions are brutally honest and resolute, rendering irrelevant those mongering for light. Deeply pensive and forward thinking, his sound is marked by a distinct blend of the disparate and divergent. An appreciation of warehouse techno, industrial noise and post-punk are evident, yet challenged and reworked to form a uniquely modern style - a vitality so controlled and concentrated that it captivates immediately. His live sets are another matter of inventiveness. The superfluous eliminated, Silent Servant has, for years, been rewiring the minds and moving the bodies of those seeking the most meaningful and potent energies that electronic music has to offer.<\/p> <p>The future suggests no fatigue or surrender. Having developed a special kind of discipline, Silent Servant will no doubt continue to drive forward, bringing the truly adventurous with him. His criterion of action is freedom of movement, timelessness of expression, freedom for transgression; holding truth at most high. To that end, there is no compromise.<\/p> <p><br\/>:: DJs ::<\/p> <p>SILENT SERVANT<\/p> <p>MATT MCNEILL<\/p> <p>CHAD SPIGNER<\/p> <p><br\/>19+ $15<br\/>Party by CSC<br\/>Visuals by Jon Von Bonk<br\/>Artwork by Dan Dabu<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonEDM\/events\/226514125\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":" CSC presents SILENT SERVANT w\/ Matt McNeill and Chad Spigner","id":"226514125","time":1446866100000,"updated":1446878065000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1196924921000,"name":"Boston Electronic Dance Music Meetup","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":861021,"urlname":"BostonEDM","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"EDM Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"South Boston","address_1":"2010 Day Blvd","name":"Castle Island","lon":-71.01417,"id":24136907,"state":"MA","lat":42.338642,"repinned":true},"headcount":42,"distance":3.21854329109,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442346233000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Over a year ago, men from many men's circles gathered together. \u00a0While respecting each circle's uniqueness, we\u00a0celebrated our similarities,\u00a0gathering simply as men -- without tribal separations. \u00a0We walked away understanding that we are all \"one big team\".\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is time again to gather the men of Greater Boston together\u00a0in the spirit\u00a0of brotherhood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will reflect on the dawn -- of the day and of the rest of our lives.

Please note we will meet at the following co-ordinates as mentioned at the exact time. Note Daylight Saving will be off for this date so we will meet sharp at <b>4:30 PM EST<\/b>.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Where do I park??<\/b> There are ample parking spots absolutely free of cost! This is a recreational area and lots people will be there at the park, if the weather is not too cold. The restriction for parking is till 10:00 pm. After which certain gates are closed. This is a small area so we should be done well before the closing time.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What kind of equipment should I bring??<\/b> Medium Wide to Zoom are the best lens for shooting in this park. A 24-70 mm is a good range. Long range zooms are pretty handy since the city features are a tad bit far off. To get more reach you might want to go for the 100 mm or 135 mm or even higher. UWA in this area might not be the lens that you want, but then again suit your taste if you want to take something different. A lens shade is a must for strong lights!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What kind of a place is this?? <\/b>This is park is a safe place with ample features, easy walking paths, beautiful views of the Tobin Bridge and iconic structures in downtown Boston with an access to the waterfront. There are numerous strong lights and if you are wary about flares please carry lens shades.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What will the weather be like??<\/b> The weather during this time of the year is usually upper forties to lower forties. Although this is the hurricane season and if there are severe disruptions the event will be rescheduled. We will be close to the New Moon Phase. So if the skies are clear it calls for an opportunity for Urban star trails. Please dress accordingly and stay warm. It can get colder near the waterfront areas. Get Hand warmers, in case of Lens condensation. Be careful with your equipment especially with your tripods, be mindful of others shooting in the vicinity and enjoy the night.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Pictures from the park are provided below:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/0\/f\/600_442824079.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/5\/c\/600_442812892.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/5\/f\/600_442812895.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/d\/1\/600_442824273.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Walking Map:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/f\/0\/e\/600_442824334.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225919862\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":18900000,"name":"Mystic River Access and Tobin Memorial Bridge","id":"225919862","time":1446930900000,"updated":1447025891000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","phone":"617-923-2800","address_1":"22 Mt.

The film continues to untangle how the chemical companies obscure the risks to public health and misrepresent chemical safety data by paying \"experts\" to alarm legislators and the public about the deadly risk of removing chemical flame retardants from our homes.<\/p> <p>Through the personal stories of a cancer-surviving firefighter, a renowned chemist whose work helped remove fire retardants from kid's pajamas in the 1970s, and a brave and determined young Maine legislator and mom, TOXIC HOT SEAT reveals the courage of brave citizens willing to fight for the truth against a shadowy nexus of money and politics.<\/p> <p>[40 Leon Street is a apartment building located at\u00a040 Leon Street,\u00a0Boston,\u00a0MA 02115, in the area is commonly known as Fenway-Kenmore.]<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>How to REACH 40 Leon Street, Boston, MA 02115<\/b><br\/>* Get\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopstop.com\/route?address2=40%20Leon%20St%2c%20Boston%2c%20MA%2002115&amp;mode=s\">Train, Subway or Bus directions<\/a>\u00a0to 40 Leon St, Boston, MA 02115<br\/>*\u00a0Get\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopstop.com\/route?address2=40%20Leon%20St%2c%20Boston%2c%20MA%2002115&amp;mode=j\">Taxi times and fare<\/a>\u00a0to 40 Leon St, Boston, MA 02115<br\/>*\u00a0Get a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopstop.com\/map?address=40%20Leon%20St%2c%20Boston%2c%20MA%2002115&amp;nearby=s\">map of 40 Leon St, Boston, MA 02115<\/a><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopstop.com\/map?address=40%20Leon%20St%2c%20Boston%2c%20MA%2002115&amp;nearby=s\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-And-Cheap-Things-in-Boston\/events\/224309169\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":9000000,"name":"Screening of \"Toxic Hot Seat\" at Northeastern University, 40 Leon Street, Boston","id":"224309169","time":1446937200000,"updated":1446947008000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326394492000,"name":"Free And Cheap Things in Boston (www.FACT-Boston.com)","group_lon":-71.0299987793,"id":3093352,"urlname":"Free-And-Cheap-Things-in-Boston","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Bargain Hunters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"33 Dunster Street","name":"John Harvard's Brew House","lon":-71.119164,"id":3932782,"state":"MA","lat":42.372585,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.66189742088,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444171948000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and join us for dinner and Latin conversation, no experience necessary!

Pour over a funky and swinging rhythm section that Blues Review magazine called \"the best in the business\", and top it all off with a crazy and charismatic front man with one of the biggest blues voices around. Season with a few years on the road tearing up juke joints, festivals and concert halls across the U.S. and Canada and on both sides of the Atlantic. Sound tasty? It's a recipe for music and mayhem, for intensity and irreverence; it's THE LOVE DOGS.<\/p> <p>Based out of Boston, this hard blowing septet just celebrated its sixteenth year wowing audiences and critics alike with their combination of great musicianship and pure fun. The Dogs combine elements of jump blues, New Orleans R&amp;B and early rock 'n' roll into their own powerhouse sound. You can hear it loud and clear on their three Tone-Cool cds \"I'm Yo Dog\" (1996), \"Heavy Petting\" (1998) and \"New Tricks\" (2000). Many of the cuts from these three discs have been blues radio favorites, several of the Dogs' signature original songs have been used in feature films and on television, and one has even been sampled for use on the upcoming Run-DMC cd!<\/p> <p>But as much fun as the Dogs' studio discs are, it's nothing compared to seeing them live. FMQB magazine called Love Dogs' concerts \"the stuff of legend\" where \"soulful vocals, killer grooves, unpredictability and pure entertainment play equal parts\". With their newest cd \"Live And On Fire\" The Love Dogs have finally captured the unbridled energy of their live show on disc. Far from a live retread of previously recorded tunes, \"Live And On Fire\" features ten brand new tracks captured live on a summer weekend at the famous Sea Note nightclub on the outskirts of Boston.<\/p> <p>\"It's important to us to have fun, and sometimes even we don't know what we're gonna do next.\" says lead vocalist and songwriter EDDIE \"DUATO\" SCHEER, a former sideman of R&amp;B legend Johnny Adams. \"We have a lot of humor in our music, and we love to surprise each other and make each other laugh. When a crowd can see that, it becomes contagious. Pretty soon they're giving us back as much energy as we're putting out, and the whole thing keeps escalating. We call it the 'tribal love vibe'\".<\/p> <p>Featuring some of the Northeast's best players, it's impossible not to notice the high level of musicianship in this band. \"We're all lifetime fans of blues, jazz, and R&amp;B, and we all have a real reverence for the music. Part of what makes this band special is that we really play together as a unit, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" The band's lineup consists of SCHEER, ALIZON LISSANCE (keyboards, vocals), MYANNA (alto\/tenor sax, vocals), GLENN SHAMBROOM (guitar, baritone sax), RANDY BRAMWELL (bass, vocals), STEVE BROWN (drums, vocals), along with part time Dogs MARIO PERRETT (tenor sax\/vocals), MARK PAQUIN (tenor sax, trombone) and old friend \"SAX\" GORDON BEADLE (tenor and baritone sax).<\/p> <p>Part Rat Pack party, part 20th century musical encyclopedia, and part revival meeting, \"Live And On Fire\" showcases the Dogs at their best, leaving their audience breathless and begging for more. The New York Post says \"Even though the music could make Leonardo's David dance, it's the songwriting that separates these dogs from the rest of the pack\" and Blues Review agrees \"If there were a Superbowl for crowd pleasing rhythm &amp; blues, a photo of The Love Dogs would be on every Wheaties box in America.\" Scheer sums it up by saying \"If this band doesn't put a smile on your face, check your pulse because you just might be dead.\"<\/p> <p>go to Johnny D's and make reservations now - tickets are very limited, as are spaces at our tables.

It is a way of communicating with your inner or spirit self and retrieving information. Your inner self is in constant communication with all aspects of your environment, seen and unseen. You need only journey within to find answers to your questions. Be prepared, however, for whatever insights you may receive, whether you like them or not.<br\/>The spirit healing journey is not always what people expect, and sometimes there is uncertainty as to what one should experience in altered states. The ecstatic trance is an individual journey into non-ordinary reality; therefore, experiences vary from person to person and from journey to journey. Once you enter a trance state, the rhythm or sound of the drum tends to change. The drumbeat may appear to speed up or slow down, while the sound may grow louder, softer, or disappear. You may experience a change in body temperature, feel energy flowing through your body, or find yourself twitching, swaying, or rocking. It is not uncommon to hear sounds or voices. You may even smell specific aromas. You may see colorful patterns, symbolic images, or dreamlike visions. Some people may find that they have a highly developed inner vision while others may rely more on instinct, intuition, or intent.<br\/>During the spirit healing journey, one's awareness transcends ordinary reality. In journeys to the Lower World, one may experience the sensation of falling, sliding, or spiraling downward into or under the Earth. In Upper World journeys, one may experience the sensation of rising, floating, flying, or spiraling upward through the air or sky. Journeys to the Lower World involve the movement of awareness to a level beneath ordinary reality and Celestial journeys involve movement to a level above ordinary reality. Lower levels are denser, lower in frequency, and more involved with the physical body, the earthly plane, and material reality. Higher levels are higher in frequency, less dense, and subtler.<br\/>You will experience at least two spiritual journeys. You do not need prior journeying experiences but an openness of the process and possibilities. Elaine is a training and practicing Shaman and will safely lead you on your journey. Please bring a yoga mat, blanket, something to cover your eyes (scarf), and journal as you may wish to write your experiences immediately following the journey. $10 Any questions or to register please contact Elaine [masked] or[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/224708618\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"An Evening of Shamanic Spiritual Healing","id":"qdwwpgytnbwb","time":1446939000000,"updated":1446945648000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Foxboro","address_1":"219 Patriot Pl","name":"Splitsville","lon":-71.266602,"id":22038272,"lat":42.094719,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.9505271912,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445716680000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's enjoy some bowling, pool table, and perhaps a drink (for those 21+) at Splitsville Luxury Lanes in Patriots Place.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Norfolk-County-LGBT-Social-Group-Meetup\/events\/226282412\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Splitsville Luxury Lanes","id":"226282412","time":1446940800000,"updated":1447005565000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445715516000,"name":"Norfolk County LGBT Social Group Meetup","group_lon":-71.3399963379,"id":19057470,"urlname":"Norfolk-County-LGBT-Social-Group-Meetup","group_lat":42.0600013733,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Mansfield","address_1":"263 North Main Street","name":"The Center for Holistic Healing & Art","lon":-71.218437,"id":23711201,"state":"MA","lat":42.030254,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":24.0658245087,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444074162000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Wondering how to best love the gift of enhanced sensitivity to the emotions and moods of others without letting it rule your life?

The unique blend of their voices encouraged them toward additional collaboration on festival and cocert hall stages. Enthusiastic responses from audiences around the country culminated in the recording of their first album Voices (1990, Flying Fish Records).<\/p> <p>Though the album met with critical acclaim, their busy solo careers made only occasional trio performances possible. In 1996 the trio decided to create a more formal program that would allow them to tour for three weeks out of each year.<\/p> <p>Their second release, Voices of Winter, was recorded live during that tour and released the subsequent Fall (Gadfly Records). It instantly became a favorite seasonal recording of public radio stations across the country. Called a \"genuine folk super-group\" by The Boston Globe, separately and together they have garnered countless accolades and awards from radio, press and concert presenters both within and outside the folk community. Their musical alliance has served to bring their collective vocal talents to an even larger and more diverse audience.<br\/>Priscilla, Anne and Cindy bring intricate arrangements to newly found musical treasures with an art-song vocal styling that crosses the boundaries of folk and classical music.
