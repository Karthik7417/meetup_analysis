Tired of clicking \"submit\" to hundreds of online applications and not receiving any responses? Do the pixels on your computer screen seem to be moving because you've been staring at it for so long? This group is designed for those that are unemployed and looking for a career or those that are looking to transition careers. Family and friends can provide only so much support, but I found the most comfort in people who were in the same situation as myself. The goal is to provide you with free professional development advice and strategy to help you in your career search. Whether you're a new graduate looking for your first career or a tenured professional looking to transition, all are welcome. Additionally, if you are in a neighboring area (Hoboken), feel free to attend. I believe that anyone who joins this group has something to offer, you may not know it yet. There are so many online resources to help with your job search that it can be overwhelming. I would like to put it out there that there are multiple opinions on how to handle job searching and these are just my own. Find what works best for you and try new avenues if what you're doing isn't working. I am starting this group because I want to help give others more opportunities to succeed in their job search. I know firsthand that unemployment\/career transition can leave you feeling a little lost and in need of some direction. All suggestions are welcome - interview prep, resume critique, professional dress, rolling over your 401k from a previous employer without penalty or taxes, etc. I realize that working in a team is better than working alone. If you are a professional that is looking to contribute back to your community, please let me know and we can meetup and find ways to make this group more effective. Looking forward to meeting you!<\/p>","lon":-74.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/highres_448100322.jpeg","photo_id":448100322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/600_448100322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/thumb_448100322.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":198636264,"name":"Kim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/d\/0\/highres_253264816.jpeg","photo_id":253264816,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/d\/0\/member_253264816.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/d\/0\/thumb_253264816.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"Jersey City Career Transition Meetup","id":19732696,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Jersey-City-Career-Transition-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Career Transitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458446052000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hispanicpros","name":"Hispanic Professionals","id":1676},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"black-women","name":"Black Women","id":18634},{"urlkey":"people-of-color","name":"People of Color","id":19562},{"urlkey":"black-men","name":"Black Men","id":35666},{"urlkey":"networking-happy-hour","name":"Networking Happy Hour","id":46030}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Professional-People-of-Color\/","rating":0,"description":"This group was created to serve as a platform for an array of events both professional and fun geared towards people of color.

Distinctions among genres, and between genre and literary fiction, have become irrelevant. Once, Kurt Vonnegut angrily denied that he wrote science fiction; now, the New Yorker gives it an entire issue. And Henry James scorned historical fiction as \"essentially impossible,\" which would surprise Hilary Mantel. Our program will address craft issues common to fiction in all its forms, whether mainstream or cross-genre. Our first day is a master class led by award-winning authors whose work explores the boundaries of literary, speculative, and historical fiction. On the next, you'll discuss your own and fellow writers' work in small groups. Our faculty are nationally known writers as well as experienced and accessible teachers. John Crowley's Little, Big won the World Fantasy Award and was nominated for the American Book Award. He has also received the Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He has taught creative writing at Yale since 1993. Louis Bayard is the author of Roosevelt's Beast and Mr. Timothy and teaches at George Washington University. He also wrote the New York Times' weekly recap of Downtown Abbey.

If you love the beach and love being around like minded people, this could be an opportunity for you. The group shares a beautiful 6 bedroom house in beautiful Sea Girt, NJ that is a mere 1 block to the beach and 1 block from the popular Parker House bar\/restaurant. This is by far the nicest house and most conveniently located still available for this type rental. If you live in the city or Hoboken, as many that spend the summer in this town are, there is mass transit that can take you back and forth so many spend SUnday night and do the direct morning commute into work. Still available are about 8 half shares that will allow you to use the house every other weekend as well as mid-weeks when your schedule allows. If you have a group of 3, there is still the opportunity to share the master bedroom with your own private bath. If you are not familiar with this type living and meeting arrangement, there is none better; feel free to reach out with questions and photos of the house.","lon":-74.0299987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":136853602,"name":"Jerry","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/highres_255585404.jpeg","photo_id":255585404,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/member_255585404.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/thumb_255585404.jpeg"}},"members":32,"name":"Sea Girt Jersey Shore Summer **Adults**Group Rental","id":19745572,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Sea-Girt-Jersey-Shore-Summer-Group-Rental-Adults","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Beach Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458684652000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wordpress","name":"WordPress","id":8304},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"drupal","name":"Drupal","id":10358},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"content-strategy","name":"Content Strategy","id":24417},{"urlkey":"augmented-reality","name":"Augmented Reality","id":26061},{"urlkey":"virtual-reality","name":"Virtual Reality","id":26062},{"urlkey":"content-management","name":"Content Management","id":26910},{"urlkey":"cms","name":"CMS (Content Management Systems)","id":28990},{"urlkey":"sitecore-cms","name":"Sitecore CMS","id":52276},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/future-content\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In the same way the content industry was disrupted by the advent of the internet, it is poised for another wave of disruption with the emergence of connected devices and 3D experiences for consuming content.

We take a 'no pressure' and 'no force' approach to our trips where we offer our people to be a part of BornWild without the pressure of educational talks on wild animals, nor do our travellers need to have a strong interest in Wild Animals. All we ask is for you to come along, have fun, meet new people and enjoy the social gathering. BornWild is different, as the profits we make, we personally donate a generous donation to wild animal charities. Not only will you have an amazing time with us, you'll be helping make the world a better place too.

And it might be nice to connect with others who are going through something similar. Lets get together, share stories, and offer patience and kindness to each other. Lets create a safe place to talk, give and receive support, and maybe laugh too :) I'd love to have Meetups in relaxing settings where we can comfortably get to know each other and also enjoy our surroundings in peace.

Dennis is a Holistic Health and Fitness Coach, as well as a Crossfit Level 1 trainer. He is HUGE into sports, fitness, healthy eating, preventing diseases, gut health and an incredible inspiration to our family, friends, his clients and mostly myself. I grew up passionate about dancing, painting, being outdoors in nature but for over 10 years, I have been challenged with ADHD problems and smoking addiction, which caused me to steer away form myself and from what I love. Upon meeting Dennis, I had the strong desire to change but I always felt like I was alone in my journey. Now, after almost 2 years I have been enjoying a much fresher side of life, mainly because I discovered that unhealthy habits, loneliness and depression can be best cured through movement, through being outdoors, connecting with nature and mainly through sharing this experience with other people. I love Dennis' approach to exercise and fitness, not because he is my husband, but because he is extremely creative in making workouts fun, playful, unique in such a way that while you sweat all the 'bad' stuff, you gain some great laughs with your team mates. This is something I feel like is missing in the \"gym\" world and wanted to bring it out to you too, because I know it helps, because I know you will love it too and because you will want to start moving not because you have to but because you want to. We began this type of group training, while living in New Zealand. It felt so refreshing that we decided to bring it to you too, here in New York, so you can also experience a Fresh New Day.

The energy that is created when we share our thoughts and experiences is fulfilling, reassuring, and the main reason why we are drawn to these types of gatherings. The group meets to discuss the concepts presented in the CWG (\u201cConversations With God\u201d) books written by Neale Donald Walsch. Neale's books have been on the NY Times best sellers list for years, have been translated into numerous languages, and have been sold all around the world. His writing style allows his readers to understand and engage in concepts that can sometimes be difficult or intimidating to confront. He handles the big issues such as the meaning of life, where we go when we die, and what God is really all about. He has a great sense of humor about himself and life, which makes reading his books both enjoyable and relatable. We enjoy an open-minded and inviting atmosphere where we discuss the ways that CWG has touched our lives. We discuss ways to bring those concepts into our daily lives, what we have struggled with, and how we feel we can spread the message. There is a workbook we use that is a companion to the CWG book. It serves as a guide for incorporating these principles in all aspects of our lives by using exercises and assignments that require us to think critically, and honestly about our experiences. This Meetup is open to anyone who feels the desire to engage in these conversations and to continue (or start) transformation in their lives. If you have not read the CWG books yet, please feel welcome to join us anyway. It is not a requirement of the Meetup, and we will all be happy to share our experiences with you. We will also be reading from the series during our meetings. Purchasing the book(s) is not a requirement, but if you would like to, it is available on Amazon, or www.cwg.org. On the website you will also find information about Neale and all the different resources that are available to you. In a world that is ever changing, and in a time of great need for our planet, we look forward to transforming our lives and the world around us.","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138001172,"name":"Peggy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/highres_254306096.jpeg","photo_id":254306096,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/member_254306096.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/thumb_254306096.jpeg"}},"members":71,"name":"Montville CWG Social Meetup","id":19790060,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Montville-CWG-Social-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.9099998474,"who":"Living Consciously"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459622216000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"growing-your-business","name":"Growing your business","id":55596}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wellness-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"You don't have to sweat your butt off to be health conscious.

We want to grow our community by bringing together creative and spiritually aligned individuals who want to serve the local community by sharing their gifts, talents, practices, and wisdom. Our programming revolves around self-expression, spiritual practice, and communal inclusion. We are open to all people who wish to empower themselves and those around them in creating a better world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Sacred Arts Research Foundation (SARF) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to provide support for the sacred arts through the provision of funds, space and resources for artists. Our base is at The Ark, a space in Brooklyn, NY where many of our activities occur. SARF seeks to support those who create in the realms of visual arts, music, crafting, performance and healing arts. SARF makes its space (The Ark) and its promotional network available for this purpose. SARF is a community organization which was bred out of the Golden Drum community in Brooklyn, NY. Under the guidance of community leader and Taino elder, Maestro Manuel Rufino, we have come together to create a home for the Sacred Arts in America.

New Yorkers tend to rush from place to place, often not noticing the beautiful, quirky, out-of-place things they pass by. We usually don\u2019t know that there are fascinating stories all around us. Join licensed New York City tour guides, Deb, Laurie and Alan, as they explore New York\u2019s parks, architecture, historical sites and neighborhoods so that together we can see the city as if for the very first time. While we were preparing to get our tour guide licenses, we discovered many fascinating facts about the city, many gems hidden in plain sight, many stories about the movers and shakers and the little guys that nobody remembers. We're bubbling over with excitement, and we want to share our discoveries with other people who love this great city. We also know that the opportunities for learning about and appreciating our city are endless. Meet up with us, sometimes on an interesting street corner, sometimes for a walk, sometimes to visit an out-of-the-way museum or historic area, as we look at the city with fresh eyes. We want to learn more about the city, we love sharing what we know, and we believe that together it will be fun and a great way to meet other urban explorers. \n\nThe group's leaders are all licensed tour guides hoping to build a following. Accordingly, our Meetups will be free for the foreseeable future and are meant to give us an opportunity to practice new tours and visit sites throughout the city with other people who love exploring New York.  We'll ask you to sign up for our free newsletter and to like us on Facebook, but that will be completely voluntary. Each Meetup member will be responsible for their own incidental costs, such as admission fees, food, or transportation. If a member liked the tour or trip and felt our services were helpful, a tip would be welcomed.\n\nTo learn more about us you can visit our website at http:\/\/www.takeawalknewyork.com\/home.html  Our Meetup tours will only be announced through Meetup and will not appear on our Take a Walk New York calendar.","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194967012,"name":"Alan R Cohen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/highres_251037611.jpeg","photo_id":251037611,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/member_251037611.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/thumb_251037611.jpeg"}},"members":161,"name":"NYC explorers meetup","id":19829972,"state":"NY","urlname":"seenycwithfresheyes","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"New York City Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460424994000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"kundalini-yoga","name":"Kundalini Yoga","id":18847},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kundalini-Disco\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Kundalini Disco is a new alternative to Friday nights.

The more you pitch in, the more recreation choices you will have. <\/p>\n<p>We have found that the most amazing, AWESOME, fun,&nbsp;easy-going&nbsp;people are attracted to the name, \"Awesomely Mediocre.\" People who have a sense of humor about themselves are just more fun to be around, plain and simple! <\/p>\n<p>Got any Examples of Activities or Sports I Can Attend and\/or Organize? Yup. <\/p>\n<p>How about fitness-oriented activities such as volleyball, dodge-ball, badminton, lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, walking, pickle ball\/pickleball, hiking, flag football, soccer, golf, softball, baseball, frolf, bowling, martial arts, walking, running (I like high intensity interval training m'self!), cycling, kickball, ping-pong, corn hole, climbing, swimming, gym sessions, confidence courses, tennis, dancing, pool, boxing, yoga, capture the flag, etc., <\/p>\n<p>OR, purely recreational activities such as beer bar socials, barbeques, scavenger hunts, geocaching, picnics, cooking classes, movies, camping, scrap-booking, knitting, meditation, theater shows, wine tasting, board game nights, video game tournaments, etc. Can YOU think of anything else? <\/p>\n<p>It's Too Hard!

It doesn't matter how old you are, where you are from, or how well you speak English. Everyone is welcome, and we will support one another to speak English better.<\/p>\n<p>Why should members join: There are many English schools out there where students can learn the English grammar and composition. But what many ESL students want is&nbsp;an opportunity to practice speaking English more and better. Members will have that opportunity in the group.

The instructor will help&nbsp;members to improve their English conversational skills. <\/p>\n<p>What can members expect out of the group: The group will meet once a week on Wednesday nights from 7 PM to 8 PM. Members can stick around 15 to 20 minutes after class to hang out and ask questions. Even though the group will meet at a studio that is rented by the hour, all classes will be free of charge. <\/p>\n<p>The group will also have outing events, such as going to famous restaurants&nbsp;in NYC, Broadway musicals, sporting events, and etc.&nbsp;Members will be able to make new friends from all over the world.

The group will intentionally be small in order to cultivate personal and meaningful friendships. The emphasis is quality not quantity. ;-) <\/p>\n<p>This group is all about doing the things we love and meeting new girlfriends in the process!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;**Reasons to Join the Group**: <\/p>\n<p>1. If you are looking to meet women with a solid foundation who have similar interests (in the mid-30s to mid-40s age range). <\/p>\n<p>2. If you like to socialize, try new things and meet people in the meantime. <\/p>\n<p>3. If you are looking to meet real women minus the drama. <\/p>\n<p>4. If you love to have fun! <\/p>\n<p>5. If you have a zeal for life, an enthusiastic spirit, outgoing or shy, this group is for you. <\/p>\n<p>Activities include, but are not limited to: <\/p>\n<p>~ Taste bud Excitement: Group Dinners\/Wine Tasting\/Happy Hours\/Girl\u2019s Night Out\/Brunch <\/p>\n<p>~ The Great Outdoors: Walks\/Fairs &amp; Festivals\/Shopping Days<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;~ Look Great: Fitness Excursions\/Spa Day\/Pampering <\/p>\n<p>The possibilities are endless... your suggestions are important so \"PLEASE\" add all details in the suggestion box. <\/p>\n<p>**If you'd like to join this group, we do have a few things we require ** <\/p>\n<p>1) A photo of yourself is required to join. It makes it very difficult to find each other at gatherings if there is no photo posted. <\/p>\n<p>2) If you would like to plan an event, please contact the organizer of this group and she would love to discuss the details with you. However, please note the purpose of this group is to cultivate friendships and is not a target for soliciting goods or services through events. Anyone requesting to join the group with a 'business and\/or marketing intent' will be denied (i.e., home-based business parties such as Tupperware, Candles, Jewelry, etc.). Thanks for understanding!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;3) Please RSVP 'Yes' for an event only if you're sure you're able to attend. Space may be limited and therefore some events fill up quickly. To that end, if you have (2) or more 'No Shows' (meaning you RSVP'd 'Yes' but never 'Confirmed' for the event or showed up), you will automatically be removed to the 'Wait List' for future events. In addition, please do not RSVP 'Yes' but add a comment such as 'more of a maybe'. If you do, your RSVP will be removed, or you too will be moved to the wait list. <\/p>\n<p>4) Usually about (1) week prior to the event an email will be sent to those who RSVP'd \"Yes\" requesting that you 'Confirm' for that event. Please take a moment at that time to go to the event page, click on 'Update' (located next to the green GOING button) and add in comments section: 'Confirmed'. This step is important as most times an accurate headcount is needed to reserve a table. If you are unable to attend once that email is sent out, please kindly change your RSVP to 'Not Going'; it frees up space for another member that may currently be on the 'Waiting List' for that event.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;5) Inactive members will be removed. <\/p>\n<p>6) Lastly, show up!! Don't be shy, come out, introduce yourself and most of all....have FUN!!!<\/p>","lon":-74.1500015259,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3887747,"name":"Jordyn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/9\/0\/highres_245868784.jpeg","photo_id":245868784,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/9\/0\/member_245868784.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/9\/0\/thumb_245868784.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"Staten Island Ladies Friendship & Social Circle","id":19842059,"state":"NY","urlname":"SI-Ladies-Friendship-Social-Circle-mid-30s-to-mid-40s","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.6100006104,"who":"SI Ladies Circle"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460683076000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"travel-overseas","name":"Travel Overseas","id":22378},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"travel-companions","name":"Travel Companions","id":24285},{"urlkey":"finding-travel-companions-for-adventures","name":"Finding Travel Companions for Adventures","id":30015},{"urlkey":"singles-who-love-to-travel-travel","name":"Singles Who Love to Travel Travel","id":64816},{"urlkey":"finding-travel-companions","name":"Finding Travel Companions","id":83483},{"urlkey":"seniors-who-love-to-travel-find-travel-companion","name":"Seniors Who Love To Travel\/find Travel Companion","id":83485},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewYork-International-Travel-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>New York International Travel Group is a group for planning fun and exciting trips for international explorers who love almost independent solo travel and\/or are looking for travel buddies for future trips.

NYC TV Writing Intensive Workshop is a group that will pair together like-minded aspiring TV writers into small, 5-person workshop groups that will meet weekly. Ideally, each group will have a like-minded focus. This is a very intensive, right-to-the-point group that will follow a three month syllabus (1st month: pitch, story beats, outline, Act 1, 2nd month: 1\/2 of the script finished, 3rd month: final script finished) with deadlines, page counts, readings from screenwriting books and scripts, and edits. Each week the members will send each other their pages a couple before meet-up night, they'll print them out and read them on their own time, writing detailed edits, notes, and a write-up about the pages, as well as working on their own material. We'll then meet weekly to discuss with each other and do some voluntary readings of the scripts. This is for the most dedicated, hard-working, and passionate aspiring TV writers who have the time and availability to dedicate themselves to this group.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":93598172,"name":"William Heus","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/highres_255698255.jpeg","photo_id":255698255,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/member_255698255.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/thumb_255698255.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"NYC TV Writing Intensive Workshop","id":19844054,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-TV-Writing-Intensive-Workshop","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"aspiring TV writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460741304000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"minipinscher","name":"Miniature Pinscher","id":2009},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"min-pin","name":"min pin","id":70786}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-Waterfront-Miniature-Pinscher-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling all Miniature Pinscher owners!

Here, you will get to jam to some fun upbeat music, while working out and toning your body. If you've ever admired dancers for their bodies or the way they, here's your chance to learn some new moves and get that dancer's body. We do fitness based dance sessions, which means you do not have to \"know how to dance\" to participate. We teach dance moves and combinations that are easy to learn so that you can focus on having fun. All the music and dances used will be urban, pop and Afro-Caribbean based styles, such as hip hop, dancehall, pop, soca and more. If you're looking to learn how to dance the Waltz or the Foxtrot, this is not the group for you.

So if you free, or want to plan a last minute ride and want the company then put up a meetup. Let's just get out the house and ride.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Rides can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours+. Personally, after 90 minutes I need a break... this group is open to all motorcycle types such as canam, slingshots, sportbikes, cruisers, etc . If you have a motorcycle endorsement on your VALID license then you can ride with us. Must have valid license and insurance when riding in this group. Group good for folks that don't want to always push 150mph on the highway but okay with a highway range of 60-100mph (depending on traffic\/weather) and residential less than 55mph of course. Group good for riders who just want to cruise down the GSP, local roads and take advantage of the weather since it's cold up here more than hot. Face it... we're not in Sunny California. So any day over 60 degrees I'm on my bike, even if it is just to the gym.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I love riding to Bear mountain... have you been!! Nice easy ride. Looking for others to give ideas and share where they ride to. This is for the general area of North Jersey, Central Jersey, Parts of upstate NY (like Rockland county), &nbsp;couple NYC rides (if we're brave enough to dodge the pot holes and traffic). Don't want to suck up your whole day, just a couple of hours. I get cold easily so most rides that I plan will be in the early afternoon when the sun is the hottest. Once summer hits and it's over 65 degrees by 7am.... &nbsp;I'm all open to morning rides when the cars aren't out yet. When you plan\/host a meetup, you can make it whenever. If you want to do a Waffle house run to Bethlem, PA (45-60 minutes) then let's all go!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Come to a last minute meet up or host a meetup yourself. Be sure to enable email notification since this group is all about last minutes or check our twitter @njlastminriders. I'll try to post on twitter as the meetups come up... i'm not great with twitter but i'm working on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;Let's do this! #Letsride.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Meetup Dues - Anyone who rides can join and post meetups. Dues are $3 annual. Which is to cover the monthly meetup fees I get hit with. Plus only serious riders who actually ride won't mind the $3 which is less than a tank of gas for your bike.&nbsp;<\/b>&nbsp;Don't want to be one of those groups with a bunch of members but only 3-4 people go on rides.

And honestly, it isn't that easy making friend these days. Second, I created it for my plus size women who are looking to build a sisterhood with other women who understand what comes along with being plus size but at the same time does not let that define them.

Artists curious about exploring public nudity. Gay\/Straight. All those who seek a free and encouraging environment to explore the human form. You will learn something. You will make a friend. Come with a mind open to new experiences. This is a safe space.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No cover - Donations greatly appreciated <br>RSVP - space is limited <br> <br>1) What IS Naked Drink n Draw?&nbsp; <br>*** It's an&nbsp;immersive study in figure drawing while under the influence. In short, you get naked, have some drinks, and draw each other. Sound fun? It is! I will generally start off the night as the first model. After that, we take a volunteer from the pool of artists. We'll continue to take turns as models while everyone else draws. The parlor will be set up for drawing, the work room will be set up for painting, and if enough people are in attendance, the bedroom may be made available for additional drawing space.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br>2) I can\u2019t draw...&nbsp; <br>*** I can't draw either. It's not about that. Nobody's going to laugh at you if you suck. You could be god awful, but you may find you're better than you think. I can guarantee you won\u2019t be the only shitty artist in the room. Besides, the only way to improve is with practice, and what better way to learn?! <br> <br>3) Are the drawings judged? <br>***&nbsp;There will be a period at the end to critique each others' work, but nobody has to participate. No obligations to share your work. If you are comfortable with your&nbsp;work being photographed, I would like to post it on the group pages. &nbsp; <br> <br>4) How much is it?&nbsp; <br>*** It\u2019s free! Of course, tips are greatly appreciated for snacks and supplies. It's normally $20 each but, if you can't afford it, we won't let that keep you from participating. it's called \"struggling artists\" for a reason.&nbsp; <br> <br>5) Can I model? <br>*** You are more than welcome to model. Take turns! Ideally, if we're all naked, we all stand an opportunity as model if we<\/span><span>&nbsp;so desire. The only rule I have is you must be nude to pose. That is sort of the point, after all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br>6) What do I bring? <br>*** Bring supplies and booze. I will provide some supplies for those without, but I'm afraid I can not supply free booze. But hey, tip&nbsp;generously&nbsp;and I'll think about it ;P&nbsp; <br> <br>7) Can I take photos? <br>*** Nope. You can draw pictures, but you can\u2019t snap them. Why, you might ask? It's kinda creepy, in a room full of naked strangers, to pull out your camera. Even if you ask, putting one \"No\" on the spot in a room full of \"Yes\" is the sort of intimidation and alienation I'm hoping to avoid. Respect this rule, please. Don't be a creep. <br> <br>8) Who can come? <br>*** Anyone! with some conditions <br>-If I do not know you, and we have never spoken, shoot me a message first. <br>-If you want to bring a guest or three, let me know.&nbsp; <br>-If you want to come but not get naked, you better be the life of the party.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br>9) Anything else I should know? <br>***This is a safe space with supportive people and a free and encouraging energy. While people will be naked, don't just assume that's license to read someone's ass like it's brail. Please be respectful, consensual adults. If you start to creep people out, you leave. Also, please be quiet in the stairwell. My neighbors are real sweet people, you guys. <br> <br>10) Where is it? <br>*** 297 Ocean ave at Parkside Ave in Brooklyn. Parkside ave Q stop. Three buildings from the subway, on Ocean, across from the park. (1D - Fourth Floor) <br> <br>11) My boyfriend is not comfortable with me coming to this thing. Is this a sex party?&nbsp; <br>*** This is my home. Keep sexpectations to a minimum, and know the line between sex and sexy. We also have couples come to every event. If your significant other is jealous, bring them!&nbsp;That said, if anything grows while you pose, don't sweat it. Appreciate it. <br> <br>12) How many people will be there? Will it be crowded?&nbsp; <br>*** I'm saying maximum capacity is 30. Won't be crowded.&nbsp; <br> <br>13) What kind of poses are we doing? <br>*** ENTIRELY up to you. You can go anywhere from Venus De Milo modesty to spred out and comfy. We're just naked people sketching naked people. For the first few hours we'll be working with short poses. After that we'll move on to longer poses. You can do couple\/group long poses or individual 10 minute poses.&nbsp; <br>If you have questions feel free to call or text me at 347.409.1220 <br><\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/highres_449398619.jpeg","photo_id":449398619,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/600_449398619.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/thumb_449398619.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":203633253,"name":"Nick Stryker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/highres_256029144.jpeg","photo_id":256029144,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/member_256029144.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/thumb_256029144.jpeg"}},"members":13,"name":"Naked Drink N Draw (NDND)","id":19884110,"state":"NY","urlname":"NDNDBrooklyn","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bayside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461648037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"healthy-kids-happy-kids","name":"HEALTHY KIDS - HAPPY KIDS","id":19625},{"urlkey":"healthy-kids","name":"Healthy Kids","id":26024},{"urlkey":"arts-crafts-for-kids","name":"Arts & Crafts for Kids","id":26389},{"urlkey":"kids-helping-kids","name":"Kids Helping Kids","id":93680},{"urlkey":"kids-meeting-kids","name":"Kids Meeting Kids","id":655642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bayside-Kids-Reading-and-Games-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Being a parent of 2 young boys, I can totally see how addicting tablets, smartphones, computer games can be to them.

UNY began in 1999, and quickly grew to become a thriving spiritual community in the Unity Worldwide movement and remains so today in the heart of New York City. Unity of New York is led by spiritual director and music minister, Rev Britt Hall. Unity is a positive path for spiritual living that provides practical teachings to help people live healthy, prosperous and meaningful lives. We honor all paths to God as we provide a philosophy that is spiritual, not religious; and love-based, not fear-based. We strive to help individuals have a stronger connection to God every day by helping them to feel empowered, accepted, loved, inspired and connected. Every follower of Unity principles (sometimes referred to as Truth Student) is free to believe what he or she chooses about God\/Spirit and our place in this beautiful and abundant universe. However, there are five concepts that Unity holds to be basic tenets: 1. God is Absolute Good. We don\u2019t believe God is a mean and vindictive man in the sky waiting to punish us for failing. God is found within our very being as Love, Peace, Joy, Wisdom, Light, Life and Perfection Itself. These God qualities are available and accessible to all of us at any moment when we simply go within to where our Creator resides. We believe that there is only One Power and One Presence in the universe and in our lives \u2013 God the Good. 2. Since God is Good, then all of us, as God\u2019s creation, must also be good. We do not believe in the concept of Original Sin; we believe that we have been created in Original Blessing. You are God\u2019s wonderful, perfect offspring at this very moment, even if you have forgotten that Truth. God cannot create anything less than Itself. Jesus, our great Teacher and Elder Brother reminded us: \u201cYou are gods\u201d (John 10:34). However, to access the fullness of this Truth, we have to awaken to it and become a co-creator with God. 3. We access God\u2019s wholeness, prosperity, peace of mind, and joy by transforming our thoughts, words and actions from negative, limiting, and defeatist, to positive, joyful and optimistic ones. We are responsible for the kind of lives we lead, regardless of what life has been up to this point. When we change our thoughts\/beliefs, we change our lives. 4. Through affirmative prayer and meditation, we experience God within us. When we take time during the day to turn everything over to Spirit, we receive exactly the right information needed to make our lives work. We must take time daily in silence for the renewal of our minds, souls and bodies. 5. Knowing these Truths intellectually isn\u2019t enough; we must implement them daily \u2013 for the realization of our Oneness with God, and to be a blessing and of service to others. Scripture tells us, \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d With joyful enthusiasm we make life a great adventure, and we (and others) are blessed beyond measure by the creative use of these Truth principles. &nbsp;For more info please chck out our web site at: unityofnewyork.org&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/highres_449441643.jpeg","photo_id":449441643,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/600_449441643.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/thumb_449441643.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":202397721,"name":"Louis O.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/highres_256108368.jpeg","photo_id":256108368,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/member_256108368.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/thumb_256108368.jpeg"}},"members":25,"name":"Unity of New York~Spiritual Center Sunday Service","id":19887325,"state":"NY","urlname":"Unity-of-New-York-Spiritual-Center-Sunday-Service","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members, Truth Students, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461718703000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"tabletop-role-playing-and-board-games","name":"Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games","id":16714},{"urlkey":"strategy-games","name":"Strategy Games","id":17785},{"urlkey":"game-design","name":"Game Design","id":19225},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"sci-fi","name":"Sci-Fi","id":21258},{"urlkey":"deck-building-games","name":"Deck Building Games","id":168992}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Star-Realms-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Let's play Star Realms and do some Star Realms tournaments!

We will meet approximately every six weeks.<\/p>\n<p><span>Stay tuned...we will announce our first book club meeting in the next few days!<\/span><br><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/b\/6\/highres_449531446.jpeg","photo_id":449531446,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/b\/6\/600_449531446.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/b\/6\/thumb_449531446.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":204132367,"name":"Kellye Rosenheim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/0\/7\/highres_256058663.jpeg","photo_id":256058663,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/0\/7\/member_256058663.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/7\/0\/7\/thumb_256058663.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"Readers' Nest","id":19890278,"state":"NY","urlname":"Readers-Nest","category":{"name":"book clubs","id":18,"shortname":"book-clubs"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Green Readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461787414000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"trans-gender-queer-queer-and-queer-friendly-peeps","name":"Trans\/Gender Queer, queer and queer friendly peeps","id":19017},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"friends-supporters-of-lgbt-glbt","name":"Friends & Supporters of LGBT\/GLBT","id":27521},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804},{"urlkey":"lesbian-outings","name":"Lesbian Outings","id":71317},{"urlkey":"lgbt-friendly","name":"LGBT Friendly","id":107996},{"urlkey":"lgbtq-friendly","name":"LGBTQ Friendly","id":116488},{"urlkey":"straight-lgbtq-friendly","name":"Straight LGBTQ friendly","id":167707}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LGBTQ-Sunday-Brunch\/","rating":0,"description":"A diverse  group of people who are LGBTQ friendly looking for places to have a fun Sunday Brunch in New York City.

Please spread the word through your networks! <br>\ufffc Teacher Bio:<br>It began seven years ago as I looked in awe at my friend as she balanced on nothing but her hands. I was from a small, homogeneous town, yoga seemed exotic, and I was competitive. \"I need to learn to do that,\" I thought, and then signed up for my first yoga class. However, what started out as an interest primarily in the physical aspect of yoga (asana) gradually and organically expanded. I noticed yoga seeping into my everyday life, and the results were positive. I taught as an apprentice in Buenos Aires in 2013 and later received 200 hours of training at Jai Yoga Arts, 30 hours at Karma Kids, and continue my studies through daily asana and meditation. I consider my practice to be a 24-hour endeavor, and encourage my students to apply the lessons they learn on the mat to lead more peaceful, aware and joyful lives. In addition to my yoga training, I have studied Rolfing\/Structural Integration through international apprenticeship and workshops, and offer sessions privately.

&nbsp;Well, join the club. &nbsp;This group is a judgment free zone where you can talk freely about relationships, sexuality, fetishes, body image and identity issues, anything really, with a group of people who are there to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>We're all fascinatingly different with regard to the particulars, but very much alike in the way we go through a lot of the same stuff. &nbsp;Figuring out what we want, how to satisfy that nagging feeling inside and trying to navigate the craziness of craigslist or whatever.<\/p>\n<p>This group will be fueled by honesty, integrity, trust, respect and shared humanity on the part of each participant. &nbsp;With those qualities in abundance, it can surely be rewarding and a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p>The content is basically anything goes, but to distinguish this from a sex or fetish party, it will operate as a succession of presentations. &nbsp;We'll call each one a Presenter. &nbsp;After getting acquainted and selecting a random ordering of Presenters, one by one each will have the opportunity to address the group and have its full attention. &nbsp;It may sound a little nerve wracking, and it very well may be, but that goes with the territory.<\/p>\n<p>The job of the participants will be to help each Presenter feel comfortable and supported as they attempt to work out whatever it is they need to work out, even if they don't quite know it themselves. &nbsp;It is extremely difficult to shed our defenses and be in the world without the safety of the masks we typically wear. &nbsp;At the same time, not being our true selves wears us down and robs us of living life fully. &nbsp;Most of us wish we could let our inner selves break free.<\/p>\n<p>That's what this is about. &nbsp;Important to state, all this nice, touchy, feely talk doesn't mean that the content will be all nice and touchy feely. &nbsp;Quite the contrary. &nbsp;Who knows what kind of \"crazy\" shit we're into? &nbsp;Sadism or masochism, exhibitionism or voyeurism, other fetishes, compulsive masturbation, we may feel miserable about our physical appearance, feel lonely and isolated, or just maybe a wee bit repressed. &nbsp;Any kinds of generalizations belie the true diversity of the dynamic individuals we all are and what makes us tick.<\/p>\n<p>Want to come and find out? &nbsp;Discover yourself in someone else's vastly different journey? &nbsp;Talk about things you've never been able to reveal to friends and family? &nbsp;Express things you are so ashamed of you feel the world will come crashing down, only to find acceptance, comradeship and helpful feedback?<\/p>\n<p>Well, then maybe you should be part of this group.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may be sensitive about subjects they consider gross or taboo, so as a participant you're just going to have to know yourself well enough to decide whether this is for you. &nbsp;Presenters may place themselves in very vulnerable positions, so we will all need to respond with a reasonable balance of honesty and support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a Presenter, you'll be free to go wherever this takes you, but refrain from crossing boundaries that might destroy the ability of the group to function. &nbsp;No outright hostility toward other participants, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone must agree to treat the things that occur with COMPLETE DISCRETION AND CONFIDENTIALITY. This cannot be over emphasized. &nbsp;Needless to say, no recording of photography will be permitted.<\/p>\n<p>On the subject of nudity, it is completely acceptable on the part of each Presenter during their presentation. &nbsp;Not required, but not at all prohibited. &nbsp;The freedom to be our true selves in the physical sense may play an important role in helping us expand the dynamic range and quality of how we relate to others. &nbsp;Sure, we'll still have our defense mechanisms there to fall back on, but at least our body language will be just that---body language! &nbsp;Nudity purely to shock would probably be frowned upon, but as a means of feeling completely accepted as we are, may be vital.<\/p>\n<p>Any form of sexual contact between participants would not be allowed, again to keep this within the bounds of focusing on the individual Presenter and what they are trying to work through. &nbsp;As far as what is permissible behavior by a Presenter, they should feel free to talk, to move, to express emotion, to disrobe, to touch themselves, dress up however they wish, use sex toys, whatever it is about themselves they want to put out before the group.<\/p>\n<p>This full range of expression is very important. &nbsp;For example, a Presenter who is troubled by a certain compulsion they continually seek to satisfy without success may gain insights from acting out this compulsion before a supportive group that might not be possible otherwise. &nbsp;Sort of getting out of your head and into your body and the real world. &nbsp;Another Presenter may just truly need to feel they are being seen for who they really are. &nbsp;Each will have to figure out for themselves where to draw the line between self indulgence and self examination. &nbsp;Reflecting on what takes place, how did it feel, how did other participants react? &nbsp;These discussions could be very rich indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Meetings would take place in a comfortable private residence in Brooklyn. &nbsp;All are welcome and a diverse group in terms of age, orientation and gender is hoped for. &nbsp;Many details still to be ironed out. &nbsp;Please contact with comments and questions. &nbsp;Thank you for reading!<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":204185699,"name":"Dave","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/highres_256084318.jpeg","photo_id":256084318,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/member_256084318.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/thumb_256084318.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Brooklyn Body Image\/Personal Fantasy Support Group","id":19893826,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Body-Image-Personal-Fantasy-Support-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Presenters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461866916000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meeting-Eating-and-Reading\/","rating":0,"description":"Group of mid-20s - mid-30s young women professionals with a shared love of reading and good food (and drinks!).

Just like it sounds \u2013 it\u2019s basically a drum circle, but for wind players. How does it work? Well, just like a drum circle, there are no formal rules. However, the participants generally approach it with a common understanding of what it\u2019s about \u2026 <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;All are welcome -- all ages, all skill levels. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Participants can drift in and out both within a session and from week to week. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;We\u2019re all there because we love music, and we\u2019re seeking a collective, supportive atmosphere that encourages listening and learning from each other rather than competition and cutting. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Finally, and most important, it\u2019s all about improvisation. There are no arrangements or orchestrations. Nobody leads the session or tries to organize the group to learn tunes in common for the next session. There\u2019s not even any need for talking about how to start when the session begins -- you just show up, join in, and play what you feel ... \u2022&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, it does need to be said that horns are very different than drums, and it might not be possible to spontaneously get a coherent sound like they do in a drum circle. If nothing else, maybe we\u2019d need to talk about what and how we\u2019re going to play before starting, right? Well, yes, some talking would facilitate the process \u2013 and since there are no rules, there definitely wouldn\u2019t be any rule against approaching it this way. On the other hand, though, an approach based on not discussing anything beforehand might be worth trying precisely because it is more challenging. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, those types of details can be worked out. At this point, we\u2019re just trying to gauge the level of interest and reach some people who might want to be involved. In terms of logistics, the venue will be somewhere outdoors (still to be determined -- Central Park? Prospect Park? Under the Williamsburg Bridge?) and we\u2019re hoping there are enough people interested so that we can make this happen once per week throughout the Summer.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64067062,"name":"Ian McAndrew","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/highres_74772192.jpeg","photo_id":74772192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/member_74772192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/thumb_74772192.jpeg"}},"members":2,"name":"NYC Woodwind \/ Brass Improviser's Circle","id":19897709,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Woodwind-Brass-Improvisers-Circle","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"creative geniuses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jamaica","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461963938000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"business-startup","name":"Business Startup","id":70328},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"startup-incubation-and-entrepreneurship-mentors","name":"Startup Incubation","id":99649},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JamaicaStartFund\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are a community of entrepreneurs, coaches, mentors, investors and enthusiastic collaborators bringing new and innovative ideas to life.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/start.fund\">Neighborhood Start Fund<\/a> is a neighborhood-specific entrepreneurship fund created by Di-Ann Eisnor and Lupe Fiasco focused on turning ideas into reality.

I have a paddle for you too. All we need is to get time on the calendar. Beach Tennis has similar scoring system to regular tennis, 'Love, 15, 30, 40, Game' with no fault nor advantage points, the ball has no bounce in your court before you hit it back to opponent so it's a quicker game then tennis and lots of fun! The court is similar in size to a beach volleyball court, 16m long x 8m wide. There are several volleyball courts in Central Park, including the courts near Sheep Meadow. If you walk toward the east side of the park from Sheep Meadow, you will find two asphalt courts and one sand court. The courts are in the center of the park near 70th Street and adjacent to the Mall. There are also asphalt courts in the center of the park at 86th Street, next to the Great Lawn and the Central Park police precinct.

Do you live in Inwood\/Northern Manhattan? We are inviting all writers, of all skill levels, to join a newly formed Writer\u2019s Group. We are two writers who need looking to jump start our own practice and want a group that supports the process. Writing can be a very isolating process so we want a community of writers who can help support and stimulate the writing process. This will include guided critiques, open readings of our work, and exploring genres written by authors of color. Writers will be encouraged to share resources, creative influences, along with individual practices. We will meet once a week for eight weeks. Our goals are to expand as writers, create a space for writers of color, allow for safe critique, and stimulate creative growth. Our workshop will focus on the beginning, middle and conclusion of a written piece for future publication and\/or sheer pleasure. The writers group will host a Public Reading in Inwood\/Northern Manhattan (location to be determined) at the end of the eight weeks.

With all of the fad diets, expensive supplements, and health myths out there, the average person can hardly be blamed for thinking that healthy living is impossible. It isn't though, and now I want to share my experiences in the hopes of helping others who are looking to make a similar journey.<\/p> \n<p>This group will be easily accessible, with weekend Meetups in cafes and casual eateries where we can all chat in a relaxed setting. There we can share advice on diet, nutrition, sleep, stress management, exercise, or any other health related subject that you may have questions about.<\/p> \n<p>If there's enough interest, I might also expand into group workout sessions at a local park or gym.

There are very few paranormal investigating teams in Brooklyn and I would like to start one. This is also a group for people who enjoy discussing about the paranormal and meeting people who share the same interests. Filmmakers are also welcome (I would also like for us to film our investigations as well) because this is a chance for you to potentially capture something very unique. Whether you are a professional or someone just starting out or a filmmaker looking for a new project to tackle, all are welcome. Ideally we would all meet once a week and plan we will do our investigations and so forth. I would like to go to several haunted locations. The goal of this group is building a team. I would like to not just meet people but hopefully we can all eventually be good friends. I don't care how much experience you have in ghost hunting.

Artists curious about exploring public nudity. Gay\/Straight. All those who seek a free and encouraging environment to explore the human form. You will learn something. You will make a friend. Come with a mind open to new experiences. This is a safe space.<\/p>\n<p>No cover - Donations greatly appreciated <br>All genders welcome <br>RSVP - space is limited<\/p>\n<p>1) What IS Naked Drink n Draw? <br>*** It's an immersive study in figure drawing while under the influence. In short, you get naked, have some drinks, and draw each other. Sound fun? It is! I will generally start off the night as the first model. After that, we take a volunteer from the pool of artists. We'll continue to take turns as models while everyone else draws. The parlor will be set up for drawing, the work room will be set up for painting, and if enough people are in attendance, the bedroom may be made available for additional drawing space.<\/p>\n<p> <br>2) I can\u2019t draw... <br>*** I can't draw either. It's not about that. Nobody's going to laugh at you if you suck. You could be god awful, but you may find you're better than you think. I can guarantee you won\u2019t be the only shitty artist in the room. Besides, the only way to improve is with practice, and what better way to learn?!<\/p>\n<p>3) Are the drawings judged? <br>*** There will be a period at the end to critique each others' work, but nobody has to participate. No obligations to share your work. If you are comfortable with your work being photographed, I would like to post it on the group pages.<\/p>\n<p>4) How much is it? <br>*** It\u2019s free! Of course, tips are greatly appreciated for snacks and supplies. It's normally $20 each but, if you can't afford it, we won't let that keep you from participating. it's called \"struggling artists\" for a reason.<\/p>\n<p>5) Can I model? <br>*** You are more than welcome to model. Take turns! Ideally, if we're all naked, we all stand an opportunity as model if we so desire. The only rule I have is you must be nude to pose. That is sort of the point, after all.<\/p>\n<p> <br>6) What do I bring? <br>*** Bring supplies and booze. I will provide some supplies for those without, but I'm afraid I can not supply free booze. But hey, tip generously and I'll think about it ;P<\/p>\n<p>7) Can I take photos? <br>*** Nope. You can draw pictures, but you can\u2019t snap them. Why, you might ask? It's kinda creepy, in a room full of naked strangers, to pull out your camera. Even if you ask, putting one \"No\" on the spot in a room full of \"Yes\" is the sort of intimidation and alienation I'm hoping to avoid. Respect this rule, please. Don't be a creep.<\/p>\n<p>8) Who can come? <br>*** Anyone! with some conditions <br>-If I do not know you, and we have never spoken, shoot me a message first. <br>-If you want to bring a guest or three, let me know. <br>-If you want to come but not get naked, you better be the life of the party.<\/p>\n<p> <br>9) Anything else I should know? <br>***This is a safe space with supportive people and a free and encouraging energy. While people will be naked, don't just assume that's license to read someone's ass like it's brail. Please be respectful, consensual adults. If you start to creep people out, you leave. Also, please be quiet in the stairwell. My neighbors are real sweet people, you guys.<\/p>\n<p>10) Where is it? <br>*** Ocean ave at Parkside Ave in Brooklyn. Parkside ave Q stop. Three buildings from the subway, on Ocean, across from the park.<\/p>\n<p>11) My boyfriend is not comfortable with me coming to this thing. Is this a sex party? <br>*** This is my home. Keep sexpectations to a minimum, and know the line between sex and sexy. We also have couples come to every event. If your significant other is jealous, bring them! That said, if anything grows while you pose, don't sweat it. Appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>12) How many people will be there? Will it be crowded? <br>*** I'm saying maximum capacity is 30. Won't be crowded.<\/p>\n<p>13) What kind of poses are we doing? <br>*** ENTIRELY up to you. You can go anywhere from Venus De Milo modesty to spred out and comfy. We're just naked people sketching naked people. For the first few hours we'll be working with short poses. After that we'll move on to longer poses. You can do couple\/group long poses or individual 10 minute poses. <br>If you have questions feel free to call or text me at 347.409.1220<\/p>","lon":-73.9199981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/highres_449555591.jpeg","photo_id":449555591,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/600_449555591.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/thumb_449555591.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":203633253,"name":"Nick Stryker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/highres_256034501.jpeg","photo_id":256034501,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/member_256034501.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/thumb_256034501.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Naked Drink N Draw (NDND) - All Genders!","id":19905160,"state":"NY","urlname":"NDNDAG","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462154457000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"punk","name":"Punk","id":450},{"urlkey":"straightedge","name":"Straight Edge","id":1683},{"urlkey":"hardcore","name":"Hardcore","id":3252},{"urlkey":"female","name":"Female","id":26399}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Straight-Edge-Ladies-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Looking to get a straight edge ladies crew started in NYC!
