He's had problems meeting his potential in a traditional school and his quirkiness started to get in the way of his ability to keep friends. That's when he received a diagnosis of high-functioning autism. At first, I'm sad to admit, the diagnosis made me see my son in a different way and I became overwhelmed with sadness, regret, anxiety and fear when I visited online communities dedicated to parents of kids with ASD diagnoses. More than anything, I felt profoundly guilty that I did not see anything wrong when I saw my son. I felt horrible that I delayed getting help for him because I didn't pathologize his quirkiness. Now I'm turning a corner. While I want to use my son's diagnosis to help him create the future he wants and to empower him during his educational career, I am not looking to \"cure him.\" I don't want to obsess about what, if anything, caused his autism and no one needs to \"fix him.\" But I am having a really hard time not only articulating my thoughts but also finding the resources and support I need in the Pittsburgh area. Am I making any sense here? Do you need help, too? To say this group is fledgling is an understatement. Right now, the group consists of me at 2 a.m. on my living room couch. However, I would love to grow a modest network of families in the Pittsburgh area who could bounce ideas off of each other and occasionally meet. Maybe we could start a Facebook group. Maybe we could share articles like these http:\/\/neurocosmopolitanism.com\/five-steps-toward-autism-acceptance\/ or read NeuroTribes by Steve Silberman. We could also meet for lectures, like this one on March 23 in Oakland http:\/\/pittsburghlectures.org\/authors-on-tour\/john-robison\/.
