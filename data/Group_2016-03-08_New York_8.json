Have your friends moved away? Got married? Had kids? This group is for ladies who are single, married or divorced, who want to have some fun and not just make new friends but also make friends for a lifetime. Having a hobby or a full time job or being a mother is great but time to time we all crave to just hang out with a few like minded folks to just chit chat over a cuppa coffee or go out with occasionally. We'll go to the movies, museums, farmers markets, dine out in local restaurants, try different cuisines , go out bicycling kayaking, plan picnics, happy hours and hey hey ! Ladies nights will always be welcome. In other words this is a social group that doesn't just focus on one thing.&nbsp;<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p><b><i>This group is created to provide a way to meet women mainly between the ages of 25 - 50 who can meet and simply be sociable.

Socionics is similar to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, only a lot more advanced to better explain personality type and inter-type relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Socionics is a personality typology developed in the 1970s and '80s by the Lithuanian researcher Dr. Au\u0161ra Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. Socionics is based on Jung's personality type theory, Freud's theory of the conscious and unconscious, and Antoni Kepinski's theory of information metabolism. Since its inception, it has been developed by a variety of Russian researchers like Gulenko. The name \"socionics\" is derived from the word \"society\", because Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 believed that each personality type has a distinct purpose in society, which can be described and explained by Socionics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships. This group is for people to learn and discuss Socionics for the purpose of self-typing and self-discovery, to find the right partner whether it is for a short or long term relationship, to improve their current social, familial, and romantic relationships, and most definitely to connect to other people who are interested in examining their lives and relationships through the Socionical lens.<\/p>\n<p>With this group, you'll be able to find out your Socionics type and learn more about your strengths, values and attitudes towards the world around you, and how you interact with those of different types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Socionics, check out our&nbsp;<a

those who want to do more in life by ridding themselves of unecessary things and continue their journey by eventually becoming a minamilst. We all at some point of time have asked ourselves, why did i buy this? or why am I here? Are you guilty of waking up three times a week after beating the heck out of the alarm clock for that dead end job called a career and asking yourself as you sit in your office, Why am I here? What about that relationship? have you been asking yourself that question as well ?. That's many of us, we want to let go but just cant, we need to let go of that clutter (clothes, magazines, paper pile up, the 6 jars of jelly that have no place in your kitchen) Whatever it may be, learning to live with less especially stress will not just make you happy but will add years to your life. Join us so that we can learn from each other that it's ok to let go of your vintage Jordache jeans, well maybe not the vintage Jordache jeans, you cant find those anymore. But you dont need another pair just because their on sale and your pockets are full with store coupons. Lets become clutter free, debt free, less stressed, more involved, so we can make room for what's really important in order to live life to the fullest.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":82079902,"name":"Kinky Nikki","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/2\/e\/highres_167669742.jpeg","photo_id":167669742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/2\/e\/member_167669742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/2\/e\/thumb_167669742.jpeg"}},"members":55,"name":"Living With Less","id":15479492,"state":"NY","urlname":"Living-With-Less","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Minimalists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1404429166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"global-citizenship","name":"Global Citizenship","id":18740},{"urlkey":"make-a-positive-impact","name":"Make a Positive Impact","id":21366},{"urlkey":"social-responsibility","name":"Social Responsibility","id":25618},{"urlkey":"service-organization","name":"service organization","id":30866},{"urlkey":"worldwide-organization","name":"Worldwide Organization","id":44538},{"urlkey":"volunteering-for-a-worthy-cause","name":"Volunteering for a Worthy Cause","id":54203},{"urlkey":"global-citizen","name":"Global Citizen","id":55006},{"urlkey":"non-profit-organizations","name":"Non Profit Organizations","id":76136},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"jci","name":"JCI","id":116601}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JCI-New-York-City-Jaycees\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are the\u00a0leading global network of young active citizens (ages range from 18-40)<\/p>\n<p>We have produced more leaders than any other young professional organization in the world (i.e. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John F.

No one is perfect and we all can sure use the support! I'm sure some days you just want to quit and give up or at least start crying because it can all be so challenging at times. I started this group because I've met so many stay at home moms but not so many working moms in Astoria. All neighborhoods are welcome of course! We can chat, text, call, Skype and all share our stories. Together we can set up play dates, plan fun activities for our children and also for ourselves. Which mom wouldn't like a moms night out, even if just for coffee, perhaps drinks or even dinner?

For example, we show up in Union Square with flowers that we give to random strangers on the street, with a smile and maybe a hug.

We organize social skates and get-togethers in the city, trips around the eastern seaboard and farther afield, clinics, seminars, parties and promote skate advocacy. We provide discounts at skating stores, discounted subscriptions to skating magazines, and occasionally give our members free merchandise from our sponsors. For a full list of membership benefits, visit the membership page on our website.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Evening\/Night Skates are a great way to meet people. Our Tuesday Night Skate, New York's longest running night skate, is for more experienced skaters who want to experience all the thrills of skating in and around the five boroughs at night. We also always join the Wednesday Night Skate leaving every Wednesday at 8 pm from Union Square South. This skate is for intermediate skaters who are comfortable skating in traffic (And it's a blast!!!).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day Skates are longer trips, usually half to a full day long, to Coney Island, CT Beaches, Westchester Trails or along the Jersey Palisades (for example), and are for intermediate level skaters. Possible day-long skates might involve hopping aboard a commuter train and heading off to a skating place in nearby Westchester, Long Island or southwestern Connecticut. Our leaders are experienced skaters who have done these routes many times. Benefit from their experience and discover places you otherwise might never have thought about reaching on skates. It's fun and easy!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Skating Trips to other cities are weekend long trips providing the opportunity to skate, party &amp; socialize with hundreds of our skater friends from all around the country (and beyond) in Philadelphia, Boston, Washington DC, Miami and elsewhere. Our own version of this is The Big Apple Roll (BAR), usually the first weekend of August each year.

Vision To support the well being of veterans, service members, and their families in communities nationwide. Connected Warriors is a community based volunteer organization providing free, trauma-conscious yoga therapy for service members, veterans and their families in the United States. Connected Warriors was founded in August 2011 by a group of professionals and yoga teachers in the South Florida area who, as long time practitioners themselves, know the powerfully beneficial effects of this ancient system. Connected Warriors has established a nationwide network that includes 568 Certified Yoga Teachers who volunteer their time and talents to instruct classes at local yoga studios, community veteran centers and other donated spaces. As of July 2013, we conduct approximately 175 classes each month with an attendance of about 1,000 participants. Therapeutic yoga practices, including relaxation and meditation, are a valuable treatment component for post traumatic stress and other trauma-related psycho-emotional difficulties. Overseas deployments can affect service members, veterans and their families for years.

We advocate for preventive medicine, especially good nutrition, conduct clinical research, and advocate for higher ethical standards in research. Our membership includes 150,000 health care professionals and concerned citizens.\n\nWe encourage higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research:\nWe oppose unethical human experiments. While great strides have been made in eliminating such experiments, problems remain. For example, children are still given synthetic growth hormone in experiments to make them taller, and both children and adults are exposed to unnecessary new drugs which have toxic effects.\n\nWe promote alternatives to animal research and animal testing. We have worked to put a stop to gruesome experiments, such as the military\u2019s cat-shooting studies, DEA narcotics experiments, and monkey self-mutilation projects. \n\nWe also promote nonanimal methods in medical education. Currently, more than three-quarters of all U.S. medical schools have dropped their animal labs for medical students.\n\nThe Physicians Committee has led the way for reforms of federal nutrition policies.  Our clinical research programs are breaking new ground in diabetes, cancer, and other serious conditions.  PCRM\u2019s Cancer Project has provided vital information to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe New Four Food Groups is the Physicians Committee's innovative proposal for a federal nutrition policy that puts a new priority on health.\n\nOur public service announcement series features medical experts on prevention and health.\n\nThe Physicians Committee is a nonprofit 501c3 organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":158713292,"name":"Kate Krone","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/highres_214434042.jpeg","photo_id":214434042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/member_214434042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/thumb_214434042.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"PCRM Benefit & Auction with Dr. Neal Barnard in Amagansett","id":16031062,"state":"NY","urlname":"PCRM-Benefit-Auction-with-Dr-Neal-Barnard-in-Amagansett","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"PCRM Supporters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Yonkers","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406578072000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrapbook","name":"Scrapbooking","id":211},{"urlkey":"jewelry","name":"Jewelry Making","id":746},{"urlkey":"cardmaking","name":"Card Making","id":6669},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"rubber-stamping","name":"Rubber Stamping","id":17350},{"urlkey":"scrapbooking-classes-workshops","name":"Scrapbooking Classes & Workshops","id":52231}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crafty-in-Yonkers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A group where locals can meet, mingle and craft.

Laurie Bizzarro, P.C.\u201d representing Plaintiffs in personal injury, construction accidents and Employment Discrimination cases.<\/p>\n<p>GARY SUTO<\/p>\n<p>Gary Suto grew up with Hungarian\/Gypsy Grandparents and was surrounded with Astrology, Palmistry, Cardomancy and Numerology. He would not consider himself a Hereditary Witch, but very close to it. He has been practicing divination for 35 years, and his skills include Tarot, Iching, Numerology, Runes and Palmistry. He is a \u00a0High Priest of Temenos Ophiuchus, a grove of the Minoan Brotherhood; High Priest in NY Coven of Witches, a coven of the Wica Tradition, initiated by Lady Rhea; Founder of NY Gay Men's Open Pagan Circle; Co-creator of NY LGBT Open Pagan Circle; Co-founder of Prometheus Rising, Queer Men's Pagan Festival; Past Instructor at the Pagan Center of NY, Psychic Reader and life coach at Magickal Realms and Catland Bookstore; \u00a0He has given workshops and led rituals at various festivals and NYC locations. Hecate came to him at one of these festivals approximately 13 years ago and has been one of his main Deities ever since. On a mundane level he is a fashion designer and graphic designer. He is putting those skills to use in creating Pagan Clothing and Jewelry as well as a Tarot deck that will incorporate the Iching.<\/p>\n<p>JSTERLING HURLEY<\/p>\n<p>From his early childhood JSterling had a connection to the plants and animals who inhabited the woods surrounding his parent\u2019s farm in central Ohio. He was raised in an agnostic home with no formal spiritual guidance which allowed him to explore his own spiritual path as a young adult.<\/p>\n<p>As an out gay youth he worked against homophobia and charted his way through hostile environments and helped other gay youth through violence, ignorance and hate.<\/p>\n<p>JSterling is a High Priest of the Minoan Fellowship Tradition and is priest of the Minoan Brotherhood. He is a green witch and has used his knowledge of plants, aromatherapy and herbology both in his magickal and mundane life. He strives to provide a venue for the LGBT pagan community to become empowered and to reclaim their place as healers, shamans and guides of the dead.\u00a0 Throughout all his training both formal and informal the constant has been the connection to his patron Goddess, Hekate. For within himself She shines through. From the wisdom of the darkness She shine light. And from the potential locked within us all she provides the key of fullness.<\/p>\n<p>MARIO PABON ANDRACA<\/p>\n<p>\u200e<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mario.a.pabon?hc_location=timeline\">Mario Pab\u00f3n Andraca<\/a> has been a practicing pagan for over fifteen years. After being a solitary practitioner for a few years, Mario joined a Wiccan coven of the Gardnerian tradition called Polyhymnia Coven in New York City. He is now a Third Degree High Priest in this Coven.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, after his first encounter with Hekate, Mario joined Arn Draiocht Fein (ADF), and successfully completed their Dedicants' program. Currently he is pursuing ADF's Clergy Training. Currently he holds the position of Scribe in the New York City Grove \"Inis Ull\".<\/p>\n<p>Mario has also recently joined both the Sorita D'Este's Covenant of Hekate, and Hellenion, a Greek Reconstructionis religious organization. Mario discovered Hekate in the Between the Worlds festival where she came to him and guided him to where he is today. His path is mostly Hellenic in private practice, while still teaching Wicca and leading a coven. Most recently he has been given the responsibility to lead and officiate the central Hekate rituals in the very same festival where she first came to him.<\/p>\n<p>MATTHEW SAWICKI<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Sawicki is a Traditional Witch and lifelong devotee of Hecate. He hails from the mountains of North Eastern Pennsylvania and learned much of his craft and magick from his upbringing there. Matthew has been initiated into three separate traditions of the craft, most notably The New York Wica Tradition where he is a 3rd Degree High Priest, The Minoan Brotherhood and the non-wiccan tradition of The Clan of Tubal Cain out of the UK, which remains his main focus and current tradition. Matthew has been a Priest of Hecate whose public rites have led people to her for over 10 years. Matthew is known for his \"Rites of Crossroads\" rituals at the Between the Worlds Men's Gathering in Ohio that has brought more than 80 men together in her worship. Matthew lives in New York City and looks forward to continuing his work as a priest of Hecate to those who seek her.<\/p>\n<p>ANNA LEWIS<\/p>\n<p>Anna Lewis, a NYC native Witch and Pagan is thrilled to be a part of the magick bringing The Temple of Hecate to light. She is a longtime friend of Lady Rhea, Magickal Realms and the NY Coven of Witches as well as Horn and Cauldron of Rhode Island. She currently lives in Rhode Island where she turns the wheel of the year with her young family, worships Yemaya in the sea by day and Hecate at the crossroads by night.

Join the thousands of Citizens Climate Lobby members who are actually moving Congress toward bold climate solutions that could change everything. <br> CCL will change the way you think about democracy. We're not about marches and protests-- we're about you talking directly to your Senators, Congressmen and their top advisers. If you want to make real change happen, this is an incredibly effective form of advocacy. You will be amazed at how much power you have as an informed and inspired citizen. <br> There are lots of ways you can inform and influence your members of Congress-- through letters, emails, phone calls, newspaper articles, and through live meetings with your Congressman, Senators and their advisers. We'll teach you how to do any or all of the above-- wherever your comfort zone takes you. And we'll inspire you to maximize your effectiveness as an advocate for real climate solutions. <br> Best of all, we have a plan and a solid climate proposal for Congress that's actually gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. It is non-partisan, politically viable, scientifically sound, and economically feasible. Economists say it is the most cost efficient approach. Scientists say it is our best shot at saving the planet. <br> We think New York area citizens deserve a special seat at the table when climate change is being discussed because when it comes to climate impacts and sea-level rise, they have a lot at stake. So we are focused on uniting New York area &nbsp;citizens this year. We already have established local CCL chapters in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens\/Nassau, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester, and Columbia counties in NY, as well as Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Red Hook, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, NY, in Fairfield County in Connecticut, and in Central New Jersey. <br> Join us for an introductory conference call or New York Area Local meeting near you! <br> Website info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com<\/a> <br> What does climate scientist Dr. James Hansen say about CCL?\"Most impressive is the work of the Citizens Climate Lobby, a relatively new, fast-growing, nonpartisan, nonprofit group with [193] chapters across the United States and Canada.

This group is open to anyone who is interested in improving their fitness, losing weight, getting stronger and becoming more flexible. My classes are primarily focused on quality, not quantity meaning I'm looking for proper form and technique while using full range of motion. Each exercise circuit is timed to ensure everyone goes at their own pace. I also use progression and regression methods based on fitness levels to ensure you are getting to most out your workout. I don't like to call my class boot camp because it sounds like a hard core, going all out until you puke class. Rather, I like to call it personal group training because its intimate in size and I can give the small groups of 10 or less individualized attention.

While DVA recognizes the challenges of living in a complex, modern society, we wish to promote the choices that provide the greatest reduction of animal suffering.

If you are seasoned, you can meet a young pup with&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of pep to do heavy lifting for you.<\/p>\n<p>5.

In addition, we have noticed that most of the language assistance content has been focused on oral communication and reading of non-fiction\/short articles in English.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The organizers of this new meetup hope to bring back the meetings to the local community: Queens. In addition to English speaking and language and cultural exchange,\u00a0we will also be focusing on writing--both academic and creative (pros\/poetry) as well as reading fiction, non-fiction, short essays, articles, excerpts from books, and poems every two weeks. Hopefully, the readings will spark discussion about themes, concepts, ideas and issues relevant the Asia diaspora; Asian American; Pacific Islander and immigrant experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our target audience is those of Asian descent in NY (Manhattan, Queens, LI, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens). Book lovers, writers, and students are encouraged to join our meetings. Whether you are a novice writer, who needs feedback, criticism, or even proof-reading; or an accomplished writer, who would like to see how your writing will be accepted by the public and how people will be impacted by your writing; or a student working on a research paper for school; in all cases, we encourage you to submit your writing and join our meet-up group. Hopefully, these original pieces will also stimulate discussion relevant to diverse Asian communities in NY and the immigrant and international experience that is NYC.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of writing are encouraged: short stories, poems, articles or essays. There will also be opportunities for peer-to-peer proofreading and also sharing your original writings with the group. There also maybe workshops on how to advance your research skills using our American library system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0And, finally, we hope to include events and activities that will allow our members to explore the city and get to know each other better. Events such as book readings and signings, dinners, or events at the Asian American Writers Workshop, or visits to interesting but obscure used bookstores, will be included. Our Meetups will be in warm environments like city parks or cafes in Queens. Since we are new, we may change the format as we cater to the ever changing needs of our members.<\/p>\n<p>Important:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0When submitting request to join please upload a real picture of yourself - otherwise your membership will be rejected.

To activate this realization, our teachers&nbsp;offer&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#transmission\">transmission<\/a> by&nbsp;non-verbally conveying the awakened condition from one individual to another. Transmission rapidly&nbsp;catalyzes your awakening, and is readily available via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#gazing\">gazing<\/a> meditation, writings, recordings, personal sessions, small group sittings or large group events.&nbsp;As a&nbsp;practitioner, you might&nbsp;notice shifts impacting many&nbsp;areas of your life in a short period of time.&nbsp;Within a few months to a few years, you\u2019ll most likely achieve your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#second-birth\">second birth<\/a>, and be deeply engaged in embodying&nbsp;that awareness throughout&nbsp;your life.<\/p> \n<p> Embodiment <\/p>\n<p>The Trillium journey&nbsp;helps you discover you are&nbsp;simultaneously infinite and finite. The embodiment dimension&nbsp;of our&nbsp;work helps you embrace infinite Consciousness throughout the full range of your unique human form, from its&nbsp;messy, uncomfortable aspects&nbsp;to its&nbsp;most&nbsp;delightful qualities.&nbsp;We use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#greenlighting\">greenlighting<\/a>, a form of&nbsp;profound compassion and radical acceptance,&nbsp;to&nbsp;become aware&nbsp;of&nbsp;whatever we are experiencing&nbsp;so that we can&nbsp;integrate it, and allow it to be organically transformed over time. Greenlighting relaxes the body-mind and enlivens the body\u2019s experience of infinite Consciousness. Facing patterns and revisiting past wounds is a natural part of the awakening process. It&nbsp;frees&nbsp;energy and attention for&nbsp;greater levels of aliveness in the present.&nbsp;For support throughout the process, we recommend you turn to&nbsp;your teachers, mentors, and peers.&nbsp;Support teams can also include <a href=\"http:\/\/teachers.trilliumawakening.org\/contact_teachers.asp#Therapist\">licensed therapists<\/a>&nbsp;as well as other practitioners within and outside the Trillium Awakening&nbsp;community.<\/p>\n<p> Mutuality<\/p>\n<p>Mutual, conscious relating is essential to the Trillium journey. Mutuality is a relationship disposition that self and other are two aspects of singular<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#being\"> Being<\/a>. In other words, other is not really \u201cother\u201d; it is also<i> you<\/i>, and it is therefore impossible to harm another person without also harming&nbsp;yourself. Living this aspect of relatedness means having profound respect for others, listening deeply, and reflecting consciously. It also means honoring and speaking your truth while making room for others to do the same\u2014which can be challenging. Through the practice of mutuality, you deeply explore and claim your authentic nature though vulnerable self-expression, even when it is uncomfortable. You also build capacity to perceive the tension and experience the discomfort in&nbsp;your differences with others. Old wounds might surface when engaging in mutuality, but, over time, the practice&nbsp;builds trust and facilitates&nbsp;deep healing and transformation. While honoring each other\u2019s truth and existential equality&nbsp;in<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#being\"> Being<\/a>, mutuality simultaneously evokes&nbsp;respect for&nbsp;the functional&nbsp;hierarchy within&nbsp;our community.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>This meet up is for the spiritually minded who feel drawn to an earthy-bodily connection to being alive and presence as their lives.<\/p>\n<p>For those who are not satisfied with soaring spirituality as enjoying as that can be but only temporary but long for an embodied heart-ful connection to themselves and others. We meet in meditation and contemplate our already whole-being lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;The alchemical charge and transformational field that gets activated when we come together completely without an agenda, just for the sake of itself, is moving and inspiring.

We are a separate entity and nobody has to join anything to work with us.<\/p>\n<p>We sit around a big wooden table and we talk about what we want to change about ourselves and what we have to do to make that happen. New habits we want to cultivate. Old habits we want to let go of. Beliefs or reactions we have that are harmful to us and other people. Sometimes we discuss ethics or science or religion.<\/p>\n<p>We decide on goals for ourselves and go to the Ethics Lab to report and for support.<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<p>Mindfulness meditations. Losing weight. Finding a correct lay monastery to join. Developing your critical faculties by use of formal logic and\/or mathematics. Overcoming addictions including addictions to emotions or ideas. Gaining weight. Expressing yourself through artwork. Prayer. Joining a group so you can trick yourself into reinventing yourself. Yoga. Finding a boyfriend or girlfriend. Jogging. Changing careers.<\/p>\n<p>Someone pointed out that we are keeping the art of conversation alive. Yep. With a bit of Socratic method, performance art and good old fashioned magic smoke &amp; mirrors mixed in.<\/p>\n<p>Three examples of the kind of thing I might recommend to someone during a talk at the Ethics Lab.<\/p>\n<p>1. Decide on the thing you want to change in yourself and then only commit to observing yourself as it is happening as the very first step.<\/p>\n<p>2. Taking the time to find out what your thoughts and feelings are about your thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n<p>3. Understanding that meditating can be whatever you are doing at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>An Ethics Lab is a place where people with different even opposing beliefs meet and learn that we are of value to each other because of those differences. It\u2019s a lab because we see being wrong as an opportunity to learn. <\/p>\n<p>I enjoy witnessing people deciding to change then doing it. I also enjoy telling their stories. I\u2019m a writer so I see the Ethics Lab as a mix of everything from poetry to journalism. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned so much from the folks who have sat at the table with me since September of last year.

Toastmasters International is a world leader in communication and leadership development. Members of Toastmasters improve their speaking skills by attending recurring meetings where they deliver speeches or evaluate other speakers. Membership in Toastmasters is one of the greatest investments you can make in yourself. How Does It Work? A Toastmasters meeting is a learn-by-doing workshop in which participants hone their speaking and leadership skills in a no-pressure atmosphere. There is no instructor in a Toastmasters meeting. Instead, members evaluate one another\u2019s presentations. This feedback process is a key part of the program\u2019s success. Meeting participants also give impromptu talks on assigned topics, conduct meetings and develop skills related to timekeeping, grammar and parliamentary procedure.<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":104903722,"name":"Greg","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/highres_224217952.jpeg","photo_id":224217952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/member_224217952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/2\/6\/0\/thumb_224217952.jpeg"}},"members":287,"name":"Harlem Toastmasters Meetup","id":16737912,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Toastmasters-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hollis","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1409622468000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"cruise-vacation","name":"Cruise Vacation","id":19052},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"finding-travel-companions-for-adventures","name":"Finding Travel Companions for Adventures","id":30015},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DONs-and-DIVAs-TRAVEL-GROUP\/","rating":4.33,"description":"<p>Calling All Travel Enthusiasts!<br>\n\nI started this group because I wanted to meet other Friendly Travels.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\nThis is a group for anyone interested in traveling \"near or far\", but does not like to go it ALONE.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All ages are welcome, but as our Group grows, we can separate trips for Singles, Families, and Couples looking to Travel together.<\/p>\n<p>We will also have \"Local Socials\", where you can meet other like-minded people to travel with and find out more information about our trips planned.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>Looking forward to exploring the \"THE WORLD\" with everybody,\u00a0together!<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>This is a group for anyone interested in traveling in groups small and large, who enjoy going to new places and meeting new people.

We already have this capability in place. However, in complex systems, the real operational challenges arise from the way system components interact. Some of these components live inside our data center, some live outside our data center, and all are updating on differing timelines. The functionality and performance of every component has the potential to change every day.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge is to identify patterns and correlations across multiple systems in our stack. We need to integrate top-down and bottom-up analysis, so we can see, for example, that trial subscription signups (a user metric) fell off at the same time that an internal API call began to fail (an application metric), and it was caused by a database host falling offline (a system metric).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>When collecting so much data, there is a risk of being overwhelmed and not being able to make sense of it all. In essence, a risk of collecting data but not producing intelligence. We combat this risk by converting our accumulated data into the most visually information-dense format available: graphs. Then we make graphs easy to compare and easy to share. We make them informative at a glance and easy for the team to keep watching. Finally, once we are regularly identifying patterns across our graphs, we should have an automated way to \"watch the graphs\" in our absence. It is not an AI or a pattern recognition \"black box\", it should just automate patterns that humans have first validated to be meaningful.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/highres_407606402.jpeg","photo_id":407606402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/600_407606402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/2\/thumb_407606402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":39920892,"name":"NYLinuxUs3r","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/highres_242207213.jpeg","photo_id":242207213,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/member_242207213.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/6\/d\/thumb_242207213.jpeg"}},"members":552,"name":"Monitoring NYC","id":16870002,"state":"NY","urlname":"Monitoring-NYC","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Monitors"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410189115000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"palestinian","name":"Palestinian Rights","id":2069},{"urlkey":"progmuslim","name":"Progressive Muslim","id":6866},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"interfaith","name":"Interfaith","id":10827},{"urlkey":"jewish","name":"Jewish","id":16684},{"urlkey":"interfaith-and-intercultural-dialogue","name":"Interfaith and intercultural dialogue","id":42728},{"urlkey":"israelis","name":"Israelis","id":62453}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dialogueproject\/","rating":0,"description":"We work on ourselves to develop mutual trust, relationships and partnerships \u2013 long time citizens, new immigrants, Palestinians, Israelis and people of diverse faiths and cultures.

Acting now is in America\u2019s best interest.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street is the game changer for a fairer, more democratic, humane, balanced, and moral American Tax System<\/p>\n<p>This tiny sales tax on Wall Street is:<br>\n\n .5% on stocks, just $.50 (50 cents) for each $100 of stock trades;<br>\n\n .1% on bonds, just $.10 (ten cents) for each $100 of bond trades;<br>\n\n .005% on derivative speculation in currencies, commodities, or other trades, just $.005 (half a penny) for each $100 of trades<\/p>\n<p>The revenue generated is estimated by economists to be up to 350 billion each year! The Robin Hood Tax can mean slightly less for the 1% at the top and lots more for the 99% below.<\/p>\n<p>Our Current Sales Tax System Does Not Tax the Items That the Top 10% American Households (by Wealth) almost exclusively own.<br>\n\n Things everyone has to buy have a Sales Tax like toilet paper, toothpaste, cars, condo\u2019s and homes. Things only the top 10% of Wealthy Households buy have no sales tax. Sadly that\u2019s True.<\/p>\n<p>Even Worse the top ten percent of American Households have 81% to 94% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and almost 80% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America. Sadly this is another clear example of: Those that have the gold get to make the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations representing over 100,000,000 Americans are now involved with the American Robin Hood Tax Campaign. Thousands of endorsers, 100\u2019s of Organization endorsers, over 1,000 economists, the Vatican, Some of the brightest minds in the country and the 4 of the richest men in America, have endorsed the Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Three Benefits of the Robin Hood Tax<br>\n\n Although every Robin Hood Tax has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.<br>\n\n Curbing volatility of financial markets<br>\n\n In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, \"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.\" Rescuing enterprise from becoming \"the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation\" was also an intended purpose of the Robin Hood Tax and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes.<br>\n\n More fair and equitable tax collection<br>\n\n Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. An Automated Payment Robin Hood tax taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.<br>\n\n According to several leading figures, the \"fairness\" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and\/or replaced, \"prevention of volatility\" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative is one such economist: he sees a Robin Hood Tax as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.[23]<br>\n\n Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives<br>\n\n According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. An Automated Payment Robin Hood Tax employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Stop Blaming the Poor for Wall Streets Greed<\/p>\n<p>Warren Buffett isn\u2019t the only rich guy who wants to higher taxes on the rich, such as The Robin Hood tax which he has specifically endorsed. A survey from Spectrem Group found that 68% of millionaires (those with investments of $1 million or more) support raising taxes on those with $1 million or more in income. Fully 61% of those worth of $5 million or more support increased taxes on million-plus earners.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/highres_409075492.jpeg","photo_id":409075492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/600_409075492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/thumb_409075492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":170802232,"name":"Robin Hood","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/highres_226474072.jpeg","photo_id":226474072,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/member_226474072.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/thumb_226474072.jpeg"}},"members":3,"name":"Manhattan - Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street Campaign Events","id":16974892,"state":"NY","urlname":"Robin-Hood-Tax-on-Wall-Street-Campaign-Events-USA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Robin Hood's Team Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410639851000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"night-photography","name":"Night Photography","id":32968},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"night-photography-workshop","name":"night photography workshop","id":127998}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYNight\/","rating":4.51,"description":"<p>New York has a long, rich history of night photography.

We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, will be judged, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can\u2019t trust the future, we need more ambition and drive, and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world \u2014 full-out. We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be. For more information about Byron Katie and her work, go to thework.com or read her book Loving What Is. There are plenty of youtube.com videos of Katie doing The Work with others and explaining how The Work works. &nbsp;Another good addition to this meetup is my meetup \"Marketing for Artists and Other Creative People\" at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon at our meet up! &nbsp; &nbsp;Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/highres_444638292.jpeg","photo_id":444638292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/600_444638292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_444638292.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14005872,"name":"DezVFX","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/highres_12033901.jpeg","photo_id":12033901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/member_12033901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/thumb_12033901.jpeg"}},"members":1501,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","id":17017142,"state":"NY","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Creative People"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410833210000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"merengue","name":"Merengue","id":20216},{"urlkey":"ballroom-latin-salsa-swing-tango-hustle","name":"Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Swing, Tango, Hustle","id":20839},{"urlkey":"hustle-dancing","name":"Hustle Dancing","id":21002},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"latin-dancing-salsa-merengue","name":"Latin Dancing - Salsa, Merengue","id":33158},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"salsa-classes","name":"Salsa Classes","id":44955},{"urlkey":"salsa-for-singles","name":"Salsa for Singles","id":52314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProAmDanceTeamNYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Do You enjoy dancing Latin, Ballroom, Salsa or all of these dances?

The home is now the most popular place to start and grow a business. One in 10 domestic properties are now home to at least 1 business and contribute $500 billion to the economy.<br>\n\nThese are not people starting businesses out of necessity through lack of jobs, they are part of a growing movement that is responding to the new opportunities technology brings and actively taking control of their own destiny by starting out from home.<br>\n\nThey are hard-working people who now have the capability to trade globally from their own kitchen table. They are growing through outsourcing work to other home-based individuals and as they do so, they are bringing important employment opportunities to rural as well as urban areas all over true world.

TO THE ORIGINAL BRONX DESIGN MEETUP GROUP<\/p>\n<p>About The Organizer: <br><\/p>\n<p>Hi! My Name is Monica Liu. I started an online Art and Design service named Mon Liu Designs and Art Studio. I run a guest house in The Bronx for traveling artists and professionals who comes from all over the world, currently looking to expand our studios into Queens, hoping to break in to NYC soon. I graduated at The New York School of Interior Design, and an ongoing Student Artist at the Art Student League of New York. I am also a mother of a very open hearted toddler boy. I have covered a variety of mediums: Mix Media Art, Fiber Art, Paper Art and Origami, Painting, Drawing, Set and stage design, Photography and Filmmaking, Economical Friendly Art Installations, Murals, Technical Drafting, Interior Design, Computer-Aid-Design and Architecture.<br><\/p>\n<p>My interest in building a group is: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. To meet Designers and Artists where we can all exchange and learn from each others work. <br><\/p>\n<p>2. To create a meditative space where we can create our work.<\/p>\n<p>3. I make sure part of my meetups are dedicated to parents with small children who never had the chance to get to know the passion inside of themselves and hoping they can find a space here to create artistically. <br><\/p>\n<p>4. I am a lover of traveling so I love to hear and share stories from people that come from other countries and go to visit the country myself to learn about different cultures.<\/p>\n<p>If What you are looking for is 3 or more of the above, You are encouraged to join! We are all about creating a positive lifestyle with arts and retreats. <br><\/p>\n<p> About The Group:<br><\/p>\n<p>We are CREATIVE DESIGNERS who are not just about pick and choose materials for a space but also working creatively on making a space, indoor or out, into creative spaces such as customized ceiling murals, economical-friendly Installations\/ Visual Displays. <br><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever wonder how to get a project started? or have you gotten in the middle of a project and needed someone to give you a nudge to help you thinking outside the box so you can see the project at a new perspective? How about brainstorming with collages, or coming up with a design pattern for a partition wall? How do I achieve that result?&nbsp; I am here to help you spark that creativity within you.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>It sounds fantastic, and we need pure confidence. Knowing that we can make something seems impossible at times when we are so caught up in our lives. SO here I am, working on the creative person in me, I want to create a group to come together with those who are at a creative block at times like myself, we all need some inspiration. We all have build-up on creativity when we dont use it, We're are all talented with something. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are at beginning level, Graduated or an Emerging Professional who did, or learning all aspects of design or getting creative with art projects, me and others are here to encourage you to get that project started and accomplished! To be sure that you get the practice with sufficient hands on experience. <br> <\/p>\n<p>We are based in the Bronx, but we will be holding some meet ups in New York City, go to shows &amp; events, design shops and workshops as we learn to do artistic things like drawing, painting and the process of making something creative. Depending on the experience of our Design Enthusiasts available, we hope to put together some hands-on real projects experiences and tailor meet ups according to our members, so be sure to let us know what you hope to achieve with us. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our group pages at the top panel, as we will consistently update inspirational websites of Art and Design Trends. Also, come back check out our calendar even when there are no meetup scheduled, we could be meeting up with other interior design group events in the city. If you have something in mind, be sure to let us know what you like to see and achieve at an upcoming meetup and we will surely do our best to tailor our meetups to the best of our group member's interest. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join us Now!<br> <\/p>\n<p>To get to know me and my company, please stay tune and find me on Pinterest and Facebook and the following links:<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest.com\/monliudesigns<\/p>\n<p><span>Mon Liu Designs Gallery &amp; Inspirations<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/\">&nbsp;&nbsp; https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/highres_440584449.jpeg","photo_id":440584449,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/600_440584449.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/thumb_440584449.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55263712,"name":"Monica Judy Liu","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/highres_130662532.jpeg","photo_id":130662532,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/member_130662532.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/2\/4\/thumb_130662532.jpeg"}},"members":29,"name":"Upper NYC Design & Art Group","id":17244512,"state":"NY","urlname":"UpperNyc-Design-Art-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Creative Designers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411842562000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"electronicmusic","name":"Electronic Music","id":411},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"housemusic","name":"House Music","id":6672},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"clubbing","name":"Clubbing","id":17969},{"urlkey":"electronic-dance-music","name":"Electronic Dance Music","id":17970},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"djs","name":"DJs","id":24129},{"urlkey":"experimental-electronic-music","name":"Experimental Electronic Music","id":39086},{"urlkey":"dj-events","name":"DJ Events","id":70201},{"urlkey":"trance-music","name":"Trance Music","id":80398}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EDM-Electronic-Dance-Music\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all Dancing and Electronica lovers!<\/p>\n<p>New to the area and exploring the CT EDM scene?&nbsp; I just moved here and have built large groups of amazing individuals in the past in other states, so let's refer some EDM &lt;3 <br> <\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Let's refer and build a MASSIVE EDM group in CT!

We want to avoid competitive training and promote co-operative collaboration and mutual support. Our desire is to be quite unique...to be VERY different than the stereotype that music educators often seem to portray. Check out (info@beyondrock.org) (facebook.com\/beyondrockcamp). That 2-4 week summer program is a model of something 'truly' unique. We desire a year round expansion of that program...this is our ultimate goal... classes, lessons, diverse workshops, showcases, etc.\u00a0 Anyone who wants to serve kids\/teens with teaching and coaching rock\/pop\/alternative\/hip-hop\/etc. music (as primary) but ALSO in various other areas... conflict resolution, acceptance of new ideas, theater improv therapy (through theater games), yoga, an array of creative activities and community and confidence reinforcement. Helping kids\/teens \"step outside their comfort zones\" with no fear of judgement. The teaching is one thing and takes exceptional people... still, it's the skilled, strategic, pro-active, organization, directorship and management part that is the really tough part.\u00a0 It takes the combination of educator, humanitarian and entrepreneur to implement such a mission. With all participants from administration to volunteers to equipment setup to instructors...we absolutely prefer the concept of the 'work WITH' mentality...we're not all that fond of the term 'work FOR'. A socialistic, democratic angle to building a company...perhaps...but it seems to work amazingly well with Beyond Rock. A feeling of ownership is essential to develop passion in an individual. That said, obviously there still needs to be an agreement on philosophy and mission and those individuals who thoughtfully plan &amp; guide - leading the course of events. They need to be sharp, very pro-active, extraordinarily communicative (staff, parents, students) and decisive.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/highres_415797942.jpeg","photo_id":415797942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/600_415797942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_415797942.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":116670792,"name":"Maria,Scott & Michael (founders)","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/highres_242605358.jpeg","photo_id":242605358,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/member_242605358.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/thumb_242605358.jpeg"}},"members":98,"name":"Business Entrepreneurs With Music Education in Mind","id":17300272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-Educators-With-Spiritual-Based-Business-in-Mind","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Educators Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412041509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"transgender","name":"TG","id":1237},{"urlkey":"genderqueer","name":"genderqueer","id":4562},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gender-fluid","name":"Gender Fluid","id":25560},{"urlkey":"gender-queer","name":"Gender Queer","id":34510},{"urlkey":"where-to-meet-other-tg-people","name":"Where to Meet other TG People","id":37560},{"urlkey":"shemales","name":"Shemales","id":49111},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"queer-and-questioning","name":"Queer and Questioning","id":53773},{"urlkey":"male-to-female-mtf-transgender","name":"Male to Female, MTF, Transgender","id":62199},{"urlkey":"transsexuals","name":"Transsexuals","id":63635},{"urlkey":"transgender-women","name":"Transgender Women","id":67037},{"urlkey":"transgender-mtf","name":"Transgender MtF","id":138956},{"urlkey":"tgirl","name":"tgirl","id":503042},{"urlkey":"transgender-non-binary","name":"TransGender \u00b7 Non-Binary","id":1497202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonbinary-Safe-Space-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>There are not a lot of safe spaces for nonbinary\/gender variant individuals to meet and socialize, so we've taken the liberty of creating one in NYC.

Women all over the world are waking up to a new renaissance of the heart, soul and body, reclaiming her inner voice and taking steps towards freedom.<\/p>\n<p>For the last five years I have been repairing my relationship with my&nbsp;mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies.&nbsp;I overcame breast cancer and had to take a really hard look at all the emotional toxins and mindset I was carrying around from my relationship with my parents and then men, I was acting out subconsciously, seeking love from a pain point. My wounds were speaking louder than my heart, they began to show me how unhappy I was. Fast forward five years to today. Today I travel and teach throughout North America sharing with women Soul Therapy Seminars and a Journey to Self Love, a two day emotionally empowering discovery of learning how to love yourself, honestly, courageously and with joy. I know you have been yearning to share with a group of women who have your back, seeking support from others who can understand your own journey, acknowledging your pain while uplifting you to greater new heights of self awareness. You've been ready for a long time now, searching and seeking your own journey to self love. I've been there, let me help guide you along the way so that you can get there with the support that you need to accelerate your life to one of freedom and inner peace. I am grateful to be able to share with you all that I have learned on my own journey to self love!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join me in&nbsp;this powerful group of women as we explore&nbsp;self love, while learning how to connect deeply to your authentic self, the part of you that is desiring to live a powerfully expressed life. There is that small voice that wants to be heard, understood, acknowledged and loved, that part is your authentic self: your soul.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Goldfarb, Licensed Soul Therapist, Spiritual Healer &amp; Guide<\/p>\n<p><span><b>Testimonials:<\/b><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I had the pleasure of taking Carolyn's \"A Journey To Self Love\" group class and it was amazing! She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. <b>- Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me. <b>- Alexandra B., NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before.

While we are primarily East Coast, Brooklyn based gamers, our online community contains gamers who we regularly play with across many different States (Utah, Colorado, New Orleans, Massachusetts... etc), across many different platforms and games. We also keep in contact with one another across many different mediums, such as facebook, skype, internet forums, and regular text. As gamers we are all adults, with full-time jobs, some with families, and\/or pursing further schooling. As a result, our atmosphere is drama-free, friendly, and mature. Who has time for drama when you have work in the morning? Ages 21+ is our preferred atmosphere. We enjoy online gaming not just as a hobby, but also a means to foster communities and build friendships. Many of us, are not just fellow gamers who share in a hobby, but are also real life friends. Many of those friendships were formed within different online gaming communities across the decade. We hope our meetup group will continue to build these types of positive relationships created by gaming. As a gaming group, we are an eclectic group with different tastes who all consider online gaming a hobby. Many of us are both casual and hardcore online gamers, with roots also stemming in tabletop and collectible card games (MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh, Versus, Pokemon, D&amp;D... etc).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We are currently engaged in Destiny for the Playstation 4 and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn across multiple platforms and are actively recruiting. While online guilds and clans are a-plenty, our group likes to know who we're playing with. If you're interested in joining our local online gaming community and our other extended online gaming community, we tend to meet-up at different places in Brooklyn and NYC.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In addition, think of our meetup as a way to meet new people who might be playing other online games as well. We hope this is an opportunity to form brand new communities, organic, specifically to meetup. Take the opportunity to meet new people and see what types of games they play. It's a great opportunity to find similar ground in similar games, to build relationships in-game and as well as in real life.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Typically we meet at Xe May Sandwich Shop: 96 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009.

We love our kids but we are on our own, out of balance because of our dual role and other work\/business\/family responsibilities and greatly value a connection with others in our situation. Let's get together for meetups to share our experiences at cafes, restaurants and fun outdoor and indoor venues throughout the city. We can also have potlucks, picnics or an informal coffee\/drink.

All of this will serve as navigational tools on our journey for love. &nbsp;My new book, Lessons from the Needle in a Haystack, will be our guide in these workshops and all-day seminars. As a courtesy to the group, the cost for the workshops are kept low so everyone has a chance to join,&nbsp;and of course are optional, as are all the gatherings. I also am organizing dances, as well as single barbecues and big single-mingles so people have a chance to meet each other. As the membership grows I will be facilitating weekend retreats.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If any of this resonates with you, this group is the right place for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those of us who do not want to watch our unlived life go by -- the one we know in our hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other

They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain. Practice mindfulness or meditation, and you grow your brain. Even just practice being curious once in a while, and usually your brain grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The goal of BrBd is to be as <b>in control of our conscious energy<\/b> as possible. The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions. Aside from the longer term benefits, practicing just makes ya feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For more on the subject of skill learning, here is a page from my website on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.com\/insights-from-research.html\">how to master anything<\/a>.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/highres_427608962.jpeg","photo_id":427608962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/600_427608962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/thumb_427608962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128312972,"name":"David Wolovsky","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/highres_238573622.jpeg","photo_id":238573622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/member_238573622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/thumb_238573622.jpeg"}},"members":397,"name":"Brain Body Mastery","id":17933752,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brain-Body-Mastery","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Brain Body Masters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"West New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414583651000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"bni","name":"BNI","id":17157},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-networking-international-bni","name":"Business Networking International (BNI)","id":22878},{"urlkey":"bni-business-based-on-professional-relationships","name":"BNI - Business based on professional relationships","id":47292},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Gold-Coast-Professional-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>If you're looking to grow your business, there is no better way than network referral marketing.
