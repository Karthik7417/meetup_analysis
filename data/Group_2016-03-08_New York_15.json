When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1. It is Free of Charge. Because It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>2. It is simple and easy.<\/p>\n<p>Do not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday. 3.

You can literally travel around the world in NY without even getting on a plane. Exploring different ethnic neighborhoods and sampling their delicious ethnic dishes is a must, whether you live in NYC or are just visiting. Eating in an ethnic restaurant is about more than just the food, it\u2019s a cultural experience that gives you a literal taste of life in another land. <\/p>\n<p><strong> OUR OBJECTIVES<\/strong>: This group is specifically meant for those who enjoy exploring the great diversity of ethnic cuisines from all around the world in a fun, relaxed atmosphere in the company of other like-minded adventurous foodies right here in the NYC and surrounding vicinities. Together we will eat our way through a cornucopia of exotic cuisines representing all corners of the globe. <\/p>\n<p><strong> OUR MEETUPS<\/strong>: Good food is meant to be shared. At each Meetup, we will dine <strong>FAMILY-STYLE, NO EXCEPTIONS<\/strong>! Attendees will have a say in the selection of a variety of dishes. Final food bill, together with tax and tips will be shared among the attendees. Any drinks are separate and are the responsibility of the drinkers.

The result is a practical, easy-to-learn system that is ideally suited to modern self-defense. Like all real self-defense, MBC tactics focus on 'stopping power' - the ability to immediately and decisively stop an assailant from continuing his attack. To this end, MBC emphasizes an in-depth understanding of human physiology and the most effective methods of targeting key structures with small, legal-to-carry knives.\"...Michael Janich<\/p>\n<p>MBC isn't knife fighting or knife dueling. &nbsp;MBC is utilizing the knife to defend against X. &nbsp;MBC isn't specifically a Filipino martial art; MBC is a bladed combative system. &nbsp;MBC is to Filipino martial arts as Kelly Mc'Cann's Combatives are to Karate (any traditional martial art).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Fees:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Trial Lesson (1st class) - FREE <br>$15\/per class (roughly a 2 hour training session)<\/p>\n<p><span>Note: Must be 18+ yrs old.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>***Due to the structure and nature of the group it is very important, for those serious minded individuals, to be active and remain active with us; excessive inactivity will result in one's removal from the group.<\/span><span>&nbsp;***<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-74.25,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/f\/highres_446738303.jpeg","photo_id":446738303,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/f\/600_446738303.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/f\/thumb_446738303.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9670623,"name":"Robert","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/0\/highres_145345552.jpeg","photo_id":145345552,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/0\/member_145345552.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/0\/thumb_145345552.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"NNJ Martial Blade Concepts Study Group","id":19550754,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NNJ-Martial-Blade-Concepts-Study-Group","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Long Island City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455129178000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"abusesurvivors","name":"Abuse Survivors","id":2071},{"urlkey":"domesviolence","name":"Domestic Violence","id":2702},{"urlkey":"domestic-abuse","name":"Domestic Abuse","id":34839},{"urlkey":"healing-from-an-abusive-relationship","name":"Healing from an Abusive Relationship","id":61192},{"urlkey":"domestic-violence-awareness","name":"Domestic Violence Awareness","id":61710},{"urlkey":"support-for-victims-of-domestic-violence","name":"Support for Victims of Domestic Violence","id":143034},{"urlkey":"healing-from-domestic-violence","name":"Healing From Domestic Violence","id":150515},{"urlkey":"survivors-of-domestic-violence","name":"survivors of domestic violence","id":157940},{"urlkey":"emotional-abuse","name":"Emotional Abuse","id":361631},{"urlkey":"ptsd-and-domestic-violence","name":"PTSD and Domestic Violence","id":1300622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bklyndvsurvivors\/","rating":0,"description":"A Brooklyn-based support group for victims and survivors of domestic violence to come together to share, inspire, commiserate, network, learn, and most of all, support one another in both our struggles and accomplishments.

Come join us to explore and enjoy great things in life, to travel together to meet members, to see the world and have lots of fun!<\/p> \n<p>I wasted my life for 20 years because of these two words, \"Job security.\" Always getting the same type of boring jobs, meetings, conference calls, training, happy hour conversations, as if my life was chained on Titanic, bleeding and screaming but no one can hear me, never knew when to stop until it hit an iceberg last April (2015) when I got really sick, almost dead, not only that, but my \"you jump I jump\" man all of a sudden became \"you sick I dump\". My heart was broken into thousand pieces. My soul and body were numb floating on ice cold water for 6 months until God sent a boat of angels and a miracle gift to wake me up, heal my wounds, lift my soul and light up my life. Thanks to God and my angels, I'm enjoying my life and financial freedom now. Each month, I travel to a different city, meeting interesting people to share my stories and the miracle gift. We also discover new stories, ideas and great things from new members in different countries. Now it's time to launch this mission in meetup and share the legend to the right people all over the world,<\/p> \n<p>- to advise them how to avoid the same mistakes that I made, &lt;br&gt;- to achieve financial success and eventually financial freedom, &lt;br&gt;- to maintain their youth, beauty and good healthy life style, &lt;br&gt;- to complete their dreams, whatever those may be.<\/p> \n<p>This is a once in a life time, truly international meetup group that you shouldn't miss. Each month we will travel to different cities to organize events to meet and greet local members. Gradually we will form a local team in each city and appoint local leadership to take charge of future events. Initial meetings will be held at least once a year or quarter, depending on member needs or requests. Later on, we may increase the freqency to once a month or week when necessary. Typical activities would include but not limited to coffee breaks, lunch, dinner, home parties, hiking, bowling, movies, book reviews, ktv, single matching, cooking, drawing, caligraphy, speech, games, meditations, tai chi, keep fit, weight loss, trading, business networking, brain storming, anything you can think of that would interest our members. During the activities, we will also spend time sharing real life stories and ideas on how to improve members' lives, financially, mentally and physically.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":188269494,"name":"Michelle Chang","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/1\/5\/a\/highres_246796730.jpeg","photo_id":246796730,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/1\/5\/a\/member_246796730.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/1\/5\/a\/thumb_246796730.jpeg"}},"members":101,"name":"World Tour of Amazing Grace","id":19564578,"state":"NY","urlname":"world-tour-of-amazing-grace","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Freedom Achievers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455387638000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scifiwriting","name":"Science Fiction Writing","id":221},{"urlkey":"writersblock","name":"Writer's Block","id":1339},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"story-structure","name":"Story Structure","id":20516},{"urlkey":"plotting","name":"Plotting","id":20517},{"urlkey":"novel-writing","name":"Novel Writing","id":20576},{"urlkey":"fantasy-writers","name":"Fantasy Writing","id":20636},{"urlkey":"critique-group","name":"Critique Group","id":34868},{"urlkey":"fiction-writing","name":"Fiction Writing","id":35807},{"urlkey":"sci-fi-fantasy-horror-writing-group","name":"Sci-fi\/Fantasy\/Horror Writing Group","id":145922},{"urlkey":"young-adult-books","name":"Young Adult Books","id":169522},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Young-Adult-Writers-Unite\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Young Adult writers unite!

But we're looking for more than just plodding through 6 standard \"slow blues\" in 6 different keys and another 6 standard \"shuffle blues\" in the other 6, with random solos, etc. You should be familiar and comfortable with your instrument and the common traditional blues forms and riffs, and be able to build and expand on them.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>We like to focus on interesting and perhaps original interpretations of a lot of 'one off' sorts of blues and RnB material, verging into jazz, rock, pop and fusion jazz, etc. Of course there will be enough raunchy 1\/4\/5's, but we'll start by trying to nail the particular factors - certain riffs, rhythms and nuances - that distinguish one from the other and characterize certain artists and styles, and\/or our own style, should we be able to develop one. That said, we hope the music will be \"open\" as well - fluid and loose, played with confidence and an adventurous spirit - both good licks and mistakes included. Call it 'the jazz spirit\" - not a \"cover band\" by any means and we're not really song-based at all - songs generally only provide a starting point for what we like to do. That's how we learn and grow as musicians.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for a drummer, a couple of guitarists who know how to play in an ensemble and not just wax into long solos, vocalists, keys, a good electric harp player. Brass and reeds that can fit into the format are also more than welcome. I am in Brooklyn, so musicians in NYC area with easy access to a venue in Manhattan or Brooklyn would be most appropriate. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I've been playing bass for many years (on and off with varying degrees of dedication) - some gigs, a lot of jamming and messing around, etc. etc. &nbsp;At the moment I own six basses, mostly short scale axes, although this count tends to vary. I love playing electric blues, funk, RnB and some light jazz, fusion jazz and acid rock. I am not a sight reader, but I do know my scales and chords well enough and my chops are respectable, including first position in many keys. I practice regularly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A number of venues where I used to jam have closed or changed their orientation. So I am dying to get together with some like minded musicians (you don't have to be a boomer) to put something together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Favorites include Muddy, Butterfield, Albert King, Wilson Pickett, Luther Allison, Fabulous TBirds, William Clarke, some Dylan and what Horace Silver I'm able to negotiate. I also have a decent number of original progressions that would be probably characterized as fusion or latin flavored blues, and of course anybody else's original material that fits our parameters is welcome. (I'm a big fan of Latin rhythms. Although I'm not well acquainted with the structure and harmonies of most Latin music, I'd love to learn about it. )<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Let's Wail!<\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p>MNG<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/7\/600_446945607.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/highres_446968787.jpeg","photo_id":446968787,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/600_446968787.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/thumb_446968787.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":190181111,"name":"Mikey Gold","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/highres_254005409.jpeg","photo_id":254005409,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/member_254005409.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/thumb_254005409.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"Boomers Blues Summit","id":19565093,"state":"NY","urlname":"Boomers-Blues-Summit","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"musicians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455394646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"paddling","name":"Paddling","id":726},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"exhawaiians","name":"Hawaiian Culture","id":7071},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"the-aloha-spirit","name":"The Aloha Spirit","id":24334},{"urlkey":"canoe","name":"Canoeing","id":31885},{"urlkey":"east-coast","name":"East Coast","id":43608},{"urlkey":"outrigger-canoe-paddling","name":"Outrigger Canoe Paddling","id":57253},{"urlkey":"outrigger-paddling","name":"Outrigger paddling","id":1393132},{"urlkey":"outrigger","name":"Outrigger","id":1508692},{"urlkey":"vaa","name":"Va'a","id":1508693},{"urlkey":"east-coast-outrigger","name":"East Coast Outrigger","id":1508694}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/East-Coast-Outrigger-Racing-Association\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Waterwomen and Watermen -- I Mua!<\/p>\n<p>Does the open ocean call you?

The indigenous sport survived the oppression of being outlawed by foreign settlers and pushed aside by waves of modernization. In Hawai'i, King David Kalakaua, a Hawaiian monarch, is credited for catalyzing Hawaiian cultural resurgence during the late 19th century. He restored outrigger canoe racing as a legal sport for the Hawaiian people.

Each attendee will use a Web app to make a Hypothetical Investment decision in the startup and write feedback about the pitch. At the end of the pitch, each startup will be drilled with 15 mins of questions from the audience. Our goal here is to give the founders a fresh perspective and new set of eyes on their business.<\/p>\n<p> <br>Future Plan: People make vastly different investment decisions when actual money is at stake, even if the value in question is very small. We are considering charging the attendees a higher fee of which, half will be given back to them to invest in the startup that they just heard pitching (no equity involved). At the end of the pitch event, the money invested by the attendees will be given to the startup founders.&nbsp; <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>eg: If the we charge you $10 to attend the meetup we will give you back $5 which you can invest.

Don't you wish you can meet more people with the same taste of bands that you listen to? If you answered yes to both questions, then this meetup is for you!\n\nMy name is Wilfredo Betance Jr, and I've been going to metalcore shows throughout the past 9 years. I honestly want to meet more people that like my kind of music and that like to rock out at shows! The only time I'm around people that like my kind of music is when I go to shows, but everyone is usually with their group of friends and don't want to mingle! (weirdos lol). I thought to myself, \"if I'm having these thoughts, maybe there are others like me who feel the same way!\" The purpose of this group is create a fan-base group between us metalcore\/post-hardcore fans in the NJ\/NYC area to hang out and go to shows!\n\n------Questions you may have regarding the meetup group------\n\n1.What do you mean by metalcore\/post hardcore shows?\n\nI know people get the genres titles mixed up. To reduce any confusion, I'm going to list some of the bands I listen to so you guys have an idea of the type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\nA Day To Remember\nOur Last Night\nBullet for My Valentine\nSlipknot\nAsking Alexandra\nMemphis May Fire\nIssues\nI See Stars\nCrown the Empire\nBlack Veil Brides\nEscape The Fate\nSuicide Silence\nRise Against\nMotionless in White\nPalisades\nThe Amity Affliction\nSilvertien\nBlessthefall\nSleeping with sirens\nPierce the veil\nFalling in Reverse\nThe Word Alive\nBring Me The Horizon\nWe Came as Romans\nEmmure\nChunk! No, Captain Chuck!\n\nAlright, I can go on forever with this list! Lol. I hope this gives you guys an idea of type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\n2. How will this meetup operate?\nI'm going to post a list of shows that I'll be attending, and I'm going to list restaurants around the show's venue where we can meet up and hang before the show!\n\nIf you guys have any shows that you are attending and what to have it announced in the group, go ahead and announce it!\n\n--------Some ground Rules-------\n\n1. This isn't an advertisement platform. This is a platform for us like-minded people, with similar taste of music, to get to know one another and attend shows together!\n\n2. Don't make fun at others for listening to a particular band. Keep your comments and opinions to yourself.\n\nThe only type of advertising that's allowed\n1. If you are in a local band, or you have close friends that are in a local band and want to spread the word of the band's show, message me, and we'll take it from there.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nI have pretty much explained myself with the purpose of this meetup!

Joseph Shiels at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/journeywithin.org\/\">Journey Within&nbsp;<\/a>Spiritualist National Union Church.<\/p>\n<p><i>As a medium,<\/i>&nbsp;I help the bereaved to find joy, upliftment, and healing through reconnecting with their loved ones in spirit, sometimes simply to hear that they love us and are close by and other times to help heal unresolved issues or painful experiences.<\/p>\n<p><i>As an empath and intuitive,&nbsp;<\/i>I can help to carry messages from your guides and loved ones who remain close by to help and guide you throughout your life.

Having a small number of members will make getting to know each other a lot easier and form friendships** <br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup events will include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Brunch<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Happy Hour<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Girls Night Out<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Dinner and Movies<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Wine Tasting<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Outdoor activities<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Cruises<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Museums <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Spa days <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Travel, Vacation, Weekend Getaways<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Shopping<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Fashion events (NYFW)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Dancing (clubs, nightlife)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Bars, hookah lounge<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Zumba, pole dancing classes lol (they are actually a lot of fun and the workout is great for every part of your body) <br><\/p>\n<p>**NOTE: Not all meetups will be planned weeks in advanced. Some will be spontaneous\/last minute. <br><\/p>\n<p>This group doesn't have a lot of \"rules\". I only ask for 3 things from each member:<\/p>\n<p>1) Attend meetups as much as possible. (Can't build friendships if you attend only once every 6 months lol) <br><\/p>\n<p>2) Avoid the FLAKY syndrome. If you RSVP Yes please follow through with that. If your rsvp changes suddenly (it's life, things happen) please change the RSVP to No. Flakiness is not allowed and will result in immediate removal of your membership for this group. That's it! Inactivity will result in removal from the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>3) Just be yourself! This group is a judgement free zone :) <br><\/p>\n<p>Stay fabulous and I look forward to meeting you! xoxo <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/highres_447432202.jpeg","photo_id":447432202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/600_447432202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/f\/a\/a\/thumb_447432202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":140924122,"name":"Chelsea","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/highres_254453354.jpeg","photo_id":254453354,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/member_254453354.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/6\/a\/thumb_254453354.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Divas in The City","id":19586705,"state":"NY","urlname":"divasinthecity","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Divas"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455758033000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"twitter","name":"Twitter","id":10834},{"urlkey":"slack","name":"Slack","id":36628},{"urlkey":"web-bot","name":"Web Bot","id":68589},{"urlkey":"automation","name":"Automation","id":93380},{"urlkey":"bots","name":"Bots","id":1508598}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/botmakers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/botmakers.org\/\">Botmakers.org<\/a> is the official community of <a href=\"https:\/\/botwiki.org\/\">Botwiki.org<\/a> users and contributors.

Thank you for checking out our meet up! We are currently in the process of starting an Event Planning Expo business and we are currently seeking businesses who will be willing to vendor for us. Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed! Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter. We are looking for the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Photographers<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-DJs <br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Tent rentals <br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Limousine rentals<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Magicians<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Animal show businesses<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Inflatable rentals<br><br><\/p>\n<p>-Spray Art&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;...Anything Event Planning related!<br><\/p>\n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo. Thank You for your time and we hope to see you at our meet

In each meeting we fire up a discussion to explore your truest self in a safe, encouraging atmosphere and offer a self-reflective exercise for harnessing inner wisdom. If you\u2019re ready to hear and be heard by an awesome group of women, recharge your battery pack, and break all glass ceilings, then this is your time to RADIATE. \n\nNapoleon Hill outlined the mastermind principle beautifully in his book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d. He speaks of the group as a collection of energy--each one of us carries our own battery pack, but together, we increase our voltage and can bring more light into our lives and the world (through connecting with each other in an authentic way)!\n\nMany groups exist for networking purposes, particularly when it involves business, but Radiate Mastermind is not just about your business--it\u2019s about the business of living. We are, each of us, seeking our own path and doing the best we can to \u201cstay true\u201d to the path. Sometimes it gets dark, sometimes it gets overgrown, and sometimes it gets dark and overgrown all at once! Your Radiate Mastermind does not dispel the darkness, or even clear the path for you...your group simply stands with you in the dark amidst the brush, reminding you that you are not alone and that you have everything you need to forge ahead--to shine the only way that your star shines.\n\nWHO IT IS FOR:\nWomen who want to generate more joy effortlessly through a group dynamic\nWomen who are ready to experience breakthroughs and focus on the gratitude of living\nWomen who desire to be heard by others, free of judgement\nWomen who want to commit to self-care and learn how to receive from each other and themselves\n\nRadiate is led by Brittany Barton and Carolyn Agis.

Do you enjoy playing DOTA 2 and would love to play with a regular group of people? At the same time, are you also turned off by the often immature and toxic behavior in the community and want to game with some genuinely nice and civil people? Then this&nbsp;free group for adult gamers (18+) is perfect for you! <\/strong>Imagine playing DOTA 2 with kind and&nbsp;supportive adult&nbsp;teammates!... Meeting&nbsp;fellow gamers in person&nbsp;in a comfortable and public setting&nbsp;helps makes this&nbsp;possible. We also link up online and game together from the comfort of our own homes. Part of the reason why players in pubs&nbsp;keep resorting to using&nbsp;the same&nbsp;small&nbsp;group of&nbsp;hard carries&nbsp;is because there is rarely the positive space, communication&nbsp;and teamwork needed to play a crucial support role.

Strategizing before or after the match (\u201cMaybe you could buy Boots of Travel before Assault Cuirass?\u201d \/ \u201cWe should not trilane with this hero.\u201d) is much more effective in improving skill level than blaming others during the match. <em>All levels of play are welcome, so we will naturally settle into groups of 5 that have similar playstyles and skill.<\/em> <\/p>\n<p>3) <strong>Inactive (not attending any online or in-person&nbsp;Events)&nbsp;for more than 3 months (90 days)&nbsp;and you will be gently removed from the group.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>See you soon!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/highres_447147678.jpeg","photo_id":447147678,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/600_447147678.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/e\/thumb_447147678.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4590866,"name":"Louis","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/highres_254117213.jpeg","photo_id":254117213,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/member_254117213.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/d\/thumb_254117213.jpeg"}},"members":4,"name":"Uplifting DOTA 2!

Tomoko plays the gongs and Tibetan singing bowls by themselves and integrates other vibrational sound instruments to enhance the experience, making it a complete sound journey. All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

Think of the group as a technology training class that works with virtualizaiton, servers, workstations, security, encryption, scripting, management strategies, network configuration, cloud, SaaS, IOT and on and on. But we don't stop there because we also play with Raspberry Pi's by setting up tor routers or ssh servers, Amazon Echo's and trying to configure new skills on AWS micro-service servers, and on and on. We are here to share our knowledge and experience with people who want to learn, get hands on, love technology and have a good time. We would also like to learn from others.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There is nothing technology related off limits as long as we can all learn and create a project to put our book knowledge to work.

This is a meetup for those who feel that they have real singing talent and want the feedback of caring people who want to help one another. This meetup is going to be set up for a limited size group (5 people max per Meetup- want each person to really have a chance to sing and get feedback) that must be willing to commit to showing up and paying for their seat in a private karaoke room in midtown manhattan. If you do not want to pay for your spot or are just looking for a group to socialize with, there are other karaoke meetups that are much better suited for you, please check those out instead. This meetup will be dedicated to practicing, and will be a lot of fun for those who put effort into it. Please only request to join if you really want to practice singing and get feedback from your peers. This meetup is meant to be a nurturing, comfortable place for those who want to test their vocal range through their song choices, so no photos or videos will be allowed during the meetup. As mentioned, this meetup will occur in a private karaoke room; access to the room is charged per person, per hour. I will get specifics on how much each attendee will have to pay on the RSVP. The Meetup will be limited to 5 people in total (no guests allowed), so once the RSVP is open, it is first come, first served. All cancellations to an RSVP must occur 24 hours BEFORE the event because we are committing to bringing a certain number of people to in order to reserve the room. I need to be sure that everyone who RSVPs will show up to ensure we do not lose the room to a larger group (or worse, have to collectively pay for the empty seat) because we are suddenly short on people for the reservation.

All nationalities are welcome.\n\nWhat can you expect? Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 30-40 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Baby Sign Language lets babies, as young as six months old communicate their needs so they don't need to cry as often. Your baby will learn how to tell you when she is hungry, wants more, or is all done; if he is too cold or too hot, or if she just needs a hug. Studies reveal that babies who sign begin speaking earlier and have a larger vocabulary than their non-signing peers. I started this group because I wanted to empower my baby girl to express herself through signing and because I could find no classes in our local area. Packing baby up to take her into the City or into Bergen County was not something that I wanted to do on a regular basis. Instead, I've created a network of instructors who will travel to us to provide classes. Classes are fun and interactive as babies and their parents learn signing through song and music.

Get back into the game we all love and meet some great fellow baseball players and fans.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":191716618,"name":"Mike","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/a\/2\/a\/highres_254275850.jpeg","photo_id":254275850,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/a\/2\/a\/member_254275850.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/a\/2\/a\/thumb_254275850.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"NYC Casual Baseball Club","id":19633353,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Casual-Baseball-Club","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Baseballers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Old Bridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456593257000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"divorcesupport","name":"Divorce Support","id":1570},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"singles-over-50","name":"Singles Over 50","id":16948},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-and-40s","name":"Singles 30s and 40s","id":19134},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916},{"urlkey":"singles-singles-singles","name":"Singles, Singles, Singles","id":115707},{"urlkey":"singles-group-singles-30s-and-over","name":"Singles group; Singles 30s and over;","id":625622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Old-Bridge-Singles-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Come enjoy meeting single men and women between the ages of 30 and up here at Stylebar Salon and Spa!

Please respect your fellow members. Any inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and person with the inappropriate behavior will be kicked out of the group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT OUR CLIMBING EVENTS<\/strong>: Rock climbing provides a full-body workout that tests the mind as much as it does the body -- and also happens to be a lot of FUN and ADDICTIVE. There are more opportunities to do it than ever before, too, with several indoor facilities that cater to the vertical workout popping up throughout the city over the past five years. We will do climbs at Brooklyn Boulders in Queens and Brooklyn, as well as at The Cliffs in LIC. No worries if you are new to rock climbing. It's very easy to learn as long as you are open to adventures. We will practice and learn together on our way to becoming ROCK STARS.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to indoor climbing, we will on occasions do outdoor rock climbing as well as ice climbing up in the Shawangunk or the Catskills regions.<\/p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT OUR HIKES<\/strong>: We subscribe to the premise that hiking should be a fun, leisurely experience. It\u2019s NOT about how fast you can hike. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to chase after. Hiking is about taking the time to savor the sights and sounds of nature. It\u2019s about enjoying each other\u2019s company, get to know each other, while on the trails and perhaps even hug some trees along the trails. We will keep at a leisurely pace on our hikes, with plenty of stops for catching our breaths, having refreshments, and taking in all the Kodak moments. Everyone will go at their own pace, with no fear of being left behind.<\/p>\n<p><strong> PLEASE, NO SPEED DEMONS<\/strong>. If you want to go fast, there are plenty of other hiking groups on Meetup that can accommodate your need for speed. All our hikes will be on weekends within the NY\/NJ area, many of which hikes will be serviced by public transportation. Occasionally we\u2019ll do hikes where we\u2019d have to carpool to get there.<\/p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT OTHER ADVENTURES WE WILL PARTAKE IN:<\/strong> Ziplining, skiing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, travelling to places near and far, wine tasting, skydiving \u2026 or even just plain eating out, enjoying a meal together \u2026 the possibilities are ENDLESS.<\/p>\n<p><strong> WHO SHOULD JOIN THIS GROUP: <\/strong>Singles of all ages who like to hike at leisurely pace, rock climbers of all skill levels and\/or just anyone with a sense of adventure and a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and try new things. Please leave the drama and crankiness at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong> MEETUP FEE<\/strong>: It is FREE to join a Meetup group. However, each group\u2019s Organizer does pay a fee to Meetup HQ to keep the site up and running. Meetup Organizers have the option to charge a minimal fee to help defray the monthly Meetup cost. Therefore, a $1.00 Meetup fee will be collected at randomly selected events. Our organizers DO NOT make any profit from running this group.<\/p>\n<p><strong> IMPORTANT GROUP RULES<\/strong>: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group. It is about the quality of members in the group! We would rather have a small group of \"quality members\" than a huge group of \"joiners\" and \u201clurkers\u201d who never show up to any event.<\/p>\n<p> With that said:<\/p>\n<p> (1) To join the group, you must have a recognizable face picture; <\/p>\n<p> (2) Being a member in the group, you don\u2019t have to attend every event on the calendar, but try to participate in at least 1 event every few months. If you are a general lurker who join the group but not participate in any event, please don\u2019t bother to join.<\/p>\n<p><strong> General rsvp policy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> Yes rsvps ONLY if you are serious about attending an event. No need to rsvp if not attending.<\/p>\n<p> We will enforce a strict ANTI-FLAKE POLICY - Just one (1) no-show or last minute (less than 24 hours) cancel will get you booted out of the group.<\/p>\n<p> If you are an RSVP-aholic, that is, you rsvp to every single event and then bail out last minute, you do not belong in this group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/highres_447379414.jpeg","photo_id":447379414,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/600_447379414.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/thumb_447379414.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":95422062,"name":"Admin","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/highres_245379865.jpeg","photo_id":245379865,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/member_245379865.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/thumb_245379865.jpeg"}},"members":163,"name":"Climbing, Hiking, Adventures & Outdoors for Singles (CHAOS)","id":19639871,"state":"NY","urlname":"chaos-nyc","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"CHAOS-tics"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456713037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy","name":"Stand Up Comedy","id":29712},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"comedians","name":"comedians","id":52161},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"standup-comedy","name":"standup comedy","id":108531},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Laugh-Lounge-Comedy-Show-at-the-Velvet-Lounge-Brooklyn\/","rating":0,"description":"Bring the Funny!

Our goal is to provide a space for professional women from a diverse range of disciplines can relax unwind and network with peers in a collaborative and rewarding environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>While the group is mainly geared towards women, we aren't in this alone; men make up the other half of the equation and as such, men who support women's empowerment are critical allies and are welcome to bring a fresh perspective from a male p.o.v. to the group. A sample of the important areas of focus for the group include the following: <br><\/p>\n<p>Business Ideas and Strategies to Maximize Success. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you've got it all figured out and want to share, or are struggling along, this group formulates ideas and strategies to move you to the next level your career. <br><\/p>\n<p>Interpersonal Relationships and Communication <br><\/p>\n<p>Balancing work and relationships is a challenge every successful business woman must master. Here women share their experiences and strategies for having a rewarding personal life outside of the boardroom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Women's Leadership and Political Representation <br><\/p>\n<p>Representation in the business and political worlds is key to the successful integration of women into the decision-making fabric of our society. Business women explore the means for effective representation in an ever changing world. <br><\/p>\n<p>Children and Career <br><\/p>\n<p>So, we've met all the deadlines, closed the latest deal, or negotiated a jaw-dropping settlement in a lawsuit. What now? This group effectively explores and provides solutions to effectively manage our maternal instincts, with work life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Overcoming Fear of Failure <br><\/p>\n<p>\"Courage allows the successful woman to fail and learn powerful lessons, from the failure. So that in the end, she didn't fail at all.\" -Maya Angelou<\/p>\n<p> Studies show [1], a major inhibitor of success among women, much more so than men, is fear of failure. But why fear failure, when you can mine it for gems that will help you to become even more successful than you would have been without this bump in the road? This group examines the rules of engagement when facing failures. We discuss these teaching moments as phenomenal launching pads to coming back stronger and more successful than ever. <br><\/p>\n<p>Beyond our member-driven seminars and workshops, we also take time to bond and enjoy the wider world. Whether dressing up and having a night on the town or planning an adventurous excursion, anything can happen when women put their minds to it. Come join us and make friendships which will last a lifetime. <br><\/p>\n<p>[1] Clifford, Catherine. \"Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.\" Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.

The return of \"Mix To Go Massive\" to Meetup is to create a NEW atmosphere of fun and excitement for people who like to go out and dance, socialize and hear good music. Most genres are represented musically but the four most requested are top 40\/open format (a little of everything popular in a great DJ mix), EDM Parties (think Pacha and Webster Hall...MINUS those venues; no disrespect if you like them!!), house music (there are a few splits genre-wise...especially during the summer when endless outdoor parties take place)...and Caribbean events (especially if you hang out in Brooklyn). \"Mix To Go Massive\" founder Freedom hosts seven (7) events weekly with additional \"one-offs\" such as yacht parties, 1 day cruises and holiday events...and in 2017 there will be a seasonal travel-oriented event. Join the movement IF you plan to be an active member (this is one of the reasons the groups were disbanded before). Bring friends, make suggestions and attend our weekly \"town hall meetings\" where we discuss the \"business of having fun\" in New York City: Suggestions are made by members, ideas are presented to the group and \"secret\" events and VIP-only events are announced to the most active members. In addition to the Facebook page and now this meetup site you can follow the daily posts on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr @djfreedomlives as well as @djfreedomglobal (over 7,000 followers there). See you in the (social) mix!

We embrace all types of families and value diversity. &nbsp;Whether you are a stay-at-home or working parent, SOMA Families offers social events and supportive groups for you, your family, and your caregiver. &nbsp;Most of our events occur in South Orange and Maplewood (aka SOMA!). We like to get together for playdates, outings of all types, adult-only events, social services, book clubs, family events and just about anything else.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to hosting events, we also provide a community calendar of all the events going on in our community. We\u2019re pretty lucky to live in a place that has so much to offer to families and we want to help you keep track of all the fun activities in one spot.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited to have you join our group. We are an *active* group and expect our members to be active participants. We are relying on everyone\u2019s support as the more active our members are, the more we all gain. <span>This is why we ask each member to attend at least two events and organize one Meetup per year. While we do not limit our membership, our focus is on the quality of our membership, not the quantity. If members are not active, they may be removed from the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Before you join, please read through our guidelines and terms of service. Once you have read through those sections, fill out the provided questionnaire completely. This is vital! Think of your Meetup profile as you would your Facebook profile. SOMA Families is a social network where we need to know and recognize each other. This is why we require a picture and a completed questionnaire from all of our members (NOTE: This is only visible to other members as we are a private group). &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest.

We will discuss various topics including, but not limited to, personal energy and space and it's effect, ways to enhance personal strengths and minimize weaknesses, working smoothly through life transitions, belief and empowerment, learning to let go, and forgiveness as a tool for self growth.

When the yogi and dancer in us meet the interplay of their energies gives birth to a theater fueled not by their search for stardom, but by their quest for the betterment of humanity. The ultimate purpose of this yoga class is to prepare practitioners to develop a discipline and daily yoga practice in order to exercise introspection, build self-awareness and ultimately achieve growth. \"Knowing love, I will allow all things to come and go, to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage. Life is right in any case. My heart is as open as the sky.\" About Sylvie Bayeux Being a multifaceted woman Sylvie sees her self foremost as an Educator. She has been a religious yoga practitioner throughout her entire artistic career in theater and dance, developing her own personal practice based on Iyenger, Ashtanga and Multiversal schools of yoga. Teaching yoga to dancers, athletes and neophytes she helps them achieve strength, flexibility, and balance. Yet most importantly she guides them through a life-transforming experience, that of freeing their power within. Sylvie walks the path of yoga daily, as woman, dancer and artist, sharing her yoga knowledge through what she considers to be her dearest art form, the Art of Teaching.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200863933,"name":"Sylvie Bayeux","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/highres_254443135.jpeg","photo_id":254443135,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/member_254443135.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/thumb_254443135.jpeg"}},"members":25,"name":"Midtown East Yoga & Dance","id":19659610,"state":"NY","urlname":"Midtown-East-Yoga-Dance","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Yoga Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457108011000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"modern-architecture-and-design","name":"Modern Architecture and Design","id":38050},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"residential-real-estate-development","name":"Residential Real Estate Development","id":95710},{"urlkey":"architects-and-interior-designers","name":"architects and interior designers","id":699492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCArchitects-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all architects!

The cat's meow calls for a mate or its food. When our appearance and charm is fully enjoyed by another, we hear: He or She's the cat's meow. By the time we finish we will remember such moments from our lives. Also in this group we will: ~Move with playful visualizations, ~Try role plays so we can fantasize new behaviors, ~Problem solve old life scenarios, ~Have lots of discussions with partners, ~Try partner dancing. Our sensory experiences will rev up the appreciation of our bodies that are meant to be shared. When needed we will speak on our resistence to these experiences until we are comfortable. Possibly, we will see how Spirit raises our modest intentions to speak from our hearts' desire when we find and practice our own personal purring.

You can find somebody in this group or use this group as a support network to help you find somebody. Let's also share ideas and talk about ways to make non-traditional relationships work. How do you avoid getting hurt? How can you be safe? What about dealing with societal issues like women being shamed for having casual relationship? Is there a wrong way and right way to make it work?

Recently, with improvements in hi-tech tools in cognitive neuroscience, such as EEG and fMRI devices, we can see brain activity better and more clearly than ever before. In addition, with affordable technologies such as tablets, smartphones, Google Glass, etc., we can design more individualized learning media.\n\nDetermining how each student learns based on cognitive neuroscience and designing digital media for learning based on educational theories will lead to success in more students\u2019 learning. Current teaching methods are only targeting a specific group of students; however, we need more individualized learning. We are losing many talents along the way due to our poor understanding of how people learn and our inability to adjust instruction to meet each student\u2019s particular need. \n\nThis group aims to contribute to the study of mind, brain, technology and education to identify individual differences among students, create learning design principles for designing more individualized digital learning media and techniques to improve students\u2019 learning capacity. We believe the social environment affects learning as much as genetics, and we believe each student has their limitations and strengths. It is our mission to encourage students to take advantage of their strengths and to work with them to improve their limitations. \n\nThis group welcomes Cognitive Neuroscientists, Technologists, Educators and any person who is interested in using cognitive neuroscience to improve digital media design for learning.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":101942542,"name":"Aybuke","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/highres_253811800.jpeg","photo_id":253811800,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/member_253811800.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/thumb_253811800.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Mind, Brain, Technology and Education","id":19675923,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mind-Brain-Technology-and-Education","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Linden","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457378763000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scifiwriting","name":"Science Fiction Writing","id":221},{"urlkey":"writersblock","name":"Writer's Block","id":1339},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"novel-writing","name":"Novel Writing","id":20576},{"urlkey":"poetry-writing","name":"Poetry Writing","id":22655},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"short-story-writing","name":"Short Story Writing","id":35414},{"urlkey":"fiction-writing","name":"Fiction Writing","id":35807},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Linden-Elizabeth-Writers\/","rating":0,"description":"a writers group for writers in linden Elizabeth and the neighboring area","lon":-74.2600021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7500991,"name":"Dwight Taylor","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/d\/6\/4\/highres_143200292.jpeg","photo_id":143200292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/d\/6\/4\/member_143200292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/d\/6\/4\/thumb_143200292.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Linden Elizabeth Writers","id":19676187,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Linden-Elizabeth-Writers","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.6399993896,"who":"writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457379394000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nursing","name":"Nursing","id":385},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"healthpros","name":"Health Professionals","id":7102},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"healthcare-professionals","name":"Healthcare Professionals","id":22572},{"urlkey":"nursing-student","name":"Nursing Student","id":37195},{"urlkey":"nursing-home-care","name":"Nursing Home Care","id":46367},{"urlkey":"nurses","name":"Nurses","id":55568},{"urlkey":"rn","name":"RN","id":79407},{"urlkey":"nursing-school","name":"Nursing School","id":103536},{"urlkey":"nurse-practitioners","name":"Nurse Practitioners","id":134860},{"urlkey":"nurses-network","name":"nurses network","id":151025},{"urlkey":"hospitals-and-nursing-homes","name":"Hospitals and Nursing homes","id":152353},{"urlkey":"networking-for-nurses","name":"Networking for Nurses","id":154006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Nursing-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Hello fellows, Here is my idea about creating a meet up for nurses!

The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative is a series of individual learning events focused on leadership topics that are relevant to both work and personal life. Each leadership development event features a guest speaker with a deep level of expertise on a relevant topic, along with facilitated dialogue and exercises that help participants to apply knowledge to life and work. OPERATING PRINCIPLES 1. We seek to Democratize Leadership Development We believe great development opportunities should be available to anyone, anywhere. The cost however, in both time and money, can be prohibitive for many people to participate. This is especially true for individuals on a limited budget, small business owners, individual realtors and consultants, government officials, and those engaged in non-profit organizations. For people in for-profit business organizations, our offerings will complement your in- house training at a very competitive fee. To help democratize leadership development, our fees will always be reasonable, and based on the presenter's fee and costs for each event. Plus, we will allow you to self- select lower fees, if needed. We even offer a fee where you can choose to attend in exchange for performing a good deed. It will be that easy to afford! 2. Knowledge is an expense, while Applied Knowledge is development and an investment. As an example, take the simple transaction of purchasing a self-help or business book, ideally at your local bookstore. You finish reading the book, but you do not find any content meaningful to you and, as a result, you do not apply any of the content. We would suggest the purchase of this book is an expense. In another instance, you purchase and complete a different self-help or business book, you find the content relevant and, as a result, apply the content and it improves an aspect of your life\/work. This purchase can be characterized as an investment, as you received a return on your investment of the cost of this book. follow up with coaching or peer group meetings. 3. We will always do our Good Deed! In the spirit of creating meaningful change in the world, The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative will donate the net proceeds of each learning event to designated organizations that have a clear purpose of positively contributing to their community.","lon":-74.2699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201100640,"name":"John Harvey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/highres_254563924.jpeg","photo_id":254563924,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/member_254563924.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/thumb_254563924.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative","id":19677729,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Maplewood-Leadership-Development-Initiative","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Particpants"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edgewater","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457405339000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"sound-therapy-healing","name":"Sound Therapy & Healing","id":25952},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"gong-sound-bath-meditation","name":"GONG SOUND BATH MEDITATION","id":293601},{"urlkey":"healing-with-sacred-sounds","name":"HEALING WITH SACRED SOUNDS","id":293651},{"urlkey":"gongs-tibetan-singing-bowls-crystal-bowls","name":"Gongs.

Tomoko plays the gongs and Tibetan singing bowls by themselves and integrates other vibrational sound instruments to enhance the experience, making it a complete sound journey. All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

There is only one issue in the next election. Will America remain Independent or will we become part of an International Union and be under Globalist jurisdiction instead of our Constitution. President Obama signed the TPP treaty which puts American in a 12 country Uniion that nullifies our Constitution and takes away Congressional power. Mitch McConnell said it woudl be voted on by Congress AFTER the next election. Why not now? Because it destroys American workers. Trump is the only candidate to publically vow to cancel that treaty. Rubio is for it. Ted Cruz was for it before he was against it and will not answer any questions about it now. What does that tell you.
