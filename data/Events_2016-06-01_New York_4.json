Largely invisible to policy makers, plug loads have been allowed to increase without check, and as base building systems become more efficient, unregulated loads are an ever increasing percentage of building energy use.\u00a0The Plug &amp; Play event will discuss the current and future state of plug load management- the next frontier in building energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>The most successful plug load management strategies combine advances in behavioral science, technology, and public policy to fundamentally shift how we think about energy management. There are high tech solutions that involve smart, connected devices, low-tech solutions that challenge occupant behavior, and everything in between.\u00a0A moderated discussion will follow the presentations.<\/p> <p><b>More information on event schedule and registration is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/232\">available here<\/a><\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>SPEAKERS<\/b><br\/>Zach Sussman, Senior Specialist,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coned.com\/\">Con Edison<\/a><br\/>Chad Sleiman, Global Alliances Manager, Energy &amp; Asset Management,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/index.html\">Cisco Systems<\/a><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/232\">\u2013 Click here to register \u2013\u00a0<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/1\/6\/600_449159414.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYPassiveHouse-NYC\/events\/230551559\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Plug & Play: Managing Plug Loads (BEEx Event)","id":"230551559","time":1463058000000,"updated":1463067934000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1257778915000,"name":"NY Passive House (NYPH) Meetup: New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1554052,"urlname":"NYPassiveHouse-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NYPH Supporters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"28th Street and 7th Avenue ","name":"Fashion Institute of Technology ","lon":-73.993362,"id":24167267,"state":"NY","lat":40.747238,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.260349273682,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460303954000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.necss.org\">www.necss.org<\/a> for complete program and registration information<\/b><br\/><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i>What is NECSS?<br\/>Each year NECSS (pronounced \u201cnexus\u201d) welcomes over 400 attendees to New York City for a celebration of science and critical thinking.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

The group that was meant for failure (so I was told) has outlasted all of the cigar groups at that time. Nothing beats dedication and now over 290 members strong, I'm very proud to still be the founder &amp; host of this wonderful group. \u00a0But the real heroes are you. Without the wonderful gentlemen &amp; ladies that make up this group \u00a0my achievements would served no purpose. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart for making my dream come thru. OK, now that I got that out of the way, let's talk cigar events. The next meet will be at Lexington Bar &amp; Books. This is located at Lexington &amp; 73rd St. Part of the threesome of the Bar &amp; books in NYC, this one may be the most stylish. This is a bar\/lounge which is setup more like a speakeasy. A full service bar and light food is available here. I do suggest to bring your own cigars and take the $5 cutting fee. They do sell cigars here but very costly. Cigarette smokers are also welcome here. They do check dress attire when you walk in (they usually keep the front door locked) so I would eliminate any TShirts or sneakers. We haven't been here in quite awhile, so looking forward to a nice crowd.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/smokes\/events\/230629320\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"6 Years in the Making.","id":"230629320","time":1463088600000,"updated":1463165989000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1274062192000,"name":"Friendly Cigar Smokers of NYC","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1646519,"urlname":"smokes","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Cigar Smokers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"210 W 55th Street","name":"Phd Terrace @ Dream Hotel Midtown ","lon":-73.981964,"id":24283388,"lat":40.764423,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":1.08371388912,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461713513000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our weekly afterwork party in midtowns PHD Terrace , its not to be missed .<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In the bar","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Afterwork-Meet-Up-At-PHD-Rooftop-Midtown-NYC\/events\/230754033\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Lets enjoy this Thursday afterwork","id":"zssvslyvhbqb","time":1463088600000,"updated":1463100942000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1457456661000,"name":"Afterwork Meet Up At PHD Rooftop , Midtown NYC","group_lon":-73.9300003052,"id":19680684,"urlname":"Afterwork-Meet-Up-At-PHD-Rooftop-Midtown-NYC","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Afterwork Royalty"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Emerson","address_1":"214 Kinderkamack Rd","name":"Ranchero Cantina","lon":-74.026176,"id":23443952,"lat":40.97636,"repinned":false},"headcount":20,"distance":15.785905838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460232335000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as after 5pm, straight from work as we try happy hour appetizer and drink specials while socializing with MEETUP members.

THE OTHER MOZART is based on facts, stories and lines pulled directly from the Mozart family's humorous and heartbreaking letters.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>With the opulent beauty of the dress and hair design, the sweet smell of perfume and the clouds of dusting powder rising from the stage, THE OTHER MOZART is a multi-sensual experience that transports the audience into a world of outsized beauty and delight - but also of overwhelming restrictions and prejudice where, finally, this other Mozart tells her story. Period style movement creates a world of opulence and elegance through articulate delicacy of expressive balletic gestures, reverent court bows, and fan language.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nMusic<\/p> <p>Along with music composed by her famous brother and Marianna Martines (a female composer who inspired Nannerl), the play features original music by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen --- featured composers of the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center, BAM and the International Contemporary Ensemble -- for the instruments Nannerl knew intimately such as clavichords, music boxes and bells, as well as teacups, fans, and other ordinary objects that might have captured her imagination.<\/p> <p>The production features music composed by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen\u00a0(of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival and the International Contemporary Ensemble) with additional music by Marianna Martines and Wolfgang A. Mozart. Sound design by Nathan Davis. Period style movement directed by Janice Orlandi. Costume design by Magdalena Dabrowska (dress) and Miodrag Guberinic (pannier \/ corset sculpture), with dress concept by Anna Sroka and hair design by Courtney Bednarowski. Lighting design by Joshua Rose.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i>Origins &amp; Performances<\/i><\/p> <p><i>THE OTHER MOZART was developed at the Piccolo Spoleto festival and at the Cherry Lane Theatre\u00a0in NYC as part of the All For One Festival. It was presented at the Berkshire and New Orleans Fringe festivals, at Toronto University and in Munich at the Pasinger Fabrik. The play repeatedly returned to Austria in 2014 at the invitation of the Mozarteum Foundation and Mozarteum University in Salzburg. The play had a critically acclaimed Off-Broadway run at the HERE Arts Center\u00a0in New York City, and in London at St. James Theater. It continues touring internationally.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAwards &amp; Nominations<\/p> <p>THE OTHER MOZART was nominated for the 2015 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Sound Design in a Play and the 2015 Off Broadway Alliance Award for Best Solo Performance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The play was nominated for eight New York Innovative Theatre Awards:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Solo Performance - Sylvia Milo,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Director - Isaac Byrne,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Costume Design - Magdalena Dabrowska &amp; Miodrag Guberinic,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Set Design - Anna Sroka,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Sound Design - Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Music - Phyllis Chen &amp; Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Full-length script - Sylvia Milo and\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Premiere Production of a Play,\u00a0<\/p> <p>winning Outstanding Solo Performance and Outstanding Original Music.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Press &amp; Articles<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.broadwayworld.com\/off-broadway\/article\/Samantha-Hoefer-to-Share-Lead-Role-in-THE-OTHER-MOZART-Off-Broadway-Starting-1024-20151020\">Broadway World<\/a> (event description largely from here).<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2015\/sep\/08\/lost-genius-the-other-mozart-sister-nannerl\">The Guardian<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/01\/theater\/the-other-mozart-at-here-arts-center.html?_r=2\">The New York Times<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-big-stars-of-experimental-theater-1402970184\">The Wall Street Journal<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theothermozart.com\/\">Official Page<\/a>\u00a0(see for more articles)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nYou must pay your tickets at using the link provided above.

It posits a conceptual model that differs from the kinds of text representation prevalent in AI and NLP research at that time, or used now, in that it depends on what is in the text, what is inferrable from the text, and what the reader knows. This talk will present an approach to content assessment of text that was originally developed to evaluate machine-generated summaries. It is distinctive in its reliance on model summaries written by a crowd (proficient individuals working independently). The crowd supplies an emergent property of observed content: relative importance. The talk will present similarities of this content assessment approach to coding rubrics used in research on reading and writing skills; two automated approaches to the content assessment; results of a recent experiment comparing the automated approaches to a content coding rubric applied to summaries written by community college students. The conclusion will touch on questions of the feasibility and utility of deriving such a content model without the intermediary wise crowd.<\/p> <p>\n\nRebecca J. Passonneau is the Director of the Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS) at Columbia University, and a Senior Research Scientist.\u00a0 Her research addresses how the same combination of words has different meanings in different contexts, for both written and spoken language. This question is a particularly challenging object of study, because context has many dimensions. Her recent work investigates content assessment for summarization and reading and writing skills, meaning and action in human-machine dialogue, data mining that links textual and non-textual sources, and word sense annotation and representation. She received her Ph.D. from the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago in 1985, and worked at several industry and academic research labs before joining CCLS in 2006. She has over 100 publications in journals and refereed conference proceedings, and has been Principal Investigator or co-Principal Investigator on 17 sponsored projects with funding from 11 government and corporate sources.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LispNYC\/events\/227563006\/","yes_rsvp_count":100,"name":"Rebecca Passonneau on Natural Language Understanding","id":"dzfpqyvhbnb","time":1463094000000,"updated":1463147393000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1291904633000,"name":"LispNYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1748515,"urlname":"LispNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Lispnycs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"1625 Ocean Avenue","name":"East Midwood Jewish Center","lon":-73.955368,"id":23966929,"state":"NY","lat":40.622326,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.02462673187,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462320343000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's time for the May session of NightShul!<\/p> <p>NightShul is for everyone in Brooklyn\u2019s progressive Jewish Community (nightshul.org for more information and to sign up).

Often we focus on Western representations of various Middle Eastern people and in doing so we miss a vital perspective and are often given inaccurate representations. Moderator James Wellford and panelists Myriam Abdelaziz, Tamara Abdul Hadi, Laura Boushnak, Tanya Habjouqa and Alia Malek will examine the stereotypes that unfairly place a diverse group of people who practice religion differently, who dress differently, who speak different forms of Arabic, and who have different cultural traditions, into overgeneralized categories.<\/p> <p>James Wellford is a photography editor, producer, curator, and educator based in Brooklyn, New York. He is currently the Editorial Director of Visura. His collaborative work with photographers has received top honors at the Overseas Press Club, World Press Photo, POYi, American Photo, Visa Pour L\u2019image, PX 3, and NPPA. He curates photography and multimedia shows that address topical issues in the world including most recently: American Photography (Photographic Museum of Humanity), Remembering Liberia (Photoville 2013) and Iraq 10 Years (VII Gallery). James is on the advisory board of the Photobook Museum and the organization Social Documentary Network and is the co-founder of two groups: ScreenProjects and SeenUnseen that are working on ways to create, support, and deliver powerful visual and narrative stories around the world. For 12 years he was the International Photo Editor at Newsweek Magazine. James is a Knight Wallace Fellow from the University of Michigan and a contributing photo editor to Smithsonian Journeys, Foreign Policy and CNN.<\/p> <p>Alia Malek is a journalist and civil rights lawyer. She is the author of A Country Called Amreeka: US History Re-Told Through Arab American Lives. Her reportage has appeared in several places including the New York Times, The Nation, the Christian Science Monitor, Jadaliyya, McSweeneys, and Guernica.In April 2011, she moved to Damascus, Syria and wrote anonymously for several outlets from inside the country as it began to disintegrate. She returned to the US in May 2013 for the launch of Al Jazeera America, where she was Senior Writer until October 2015. She is currently the Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute and at work on a narrative non-fiction book about Syria, a memoir of family, house, and country.<\/p> <p>Rawiya, meaning she who tells a story, is the first all-female photography collective from the Middle East, and it focuses on raising visibility of female Arab photographers as well as presents an insider view of the region. The photographers, including Myriam Abdelaziz, Tamara Abdul Hadi, Laura Boushnak, and Tanya Habjouqa, combat Western stereotypes of the Middle East. The collective\u2019s photography counters these stereotypes through depictions of an all female auto-racing team, the pleasures of daily life even in the face of political turmoil and occupation, the vibrant gay community of Beirut, portraits breaking down the hyper masculine image of the Arab man as well as portraits of empowered Middle Eastern Muslim women.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceGallery\/events\/230400616\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"PANEL DISCUSSION: In Her Absence I Created Her Image","id":"230400616","time":1463094000000,"updated":1463102731000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442518768000,"name":"Open Source Gallery","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18941888,"urlname":"OpenSourceGallery","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07030","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hoboken","address_1":"38 Jackson St","address_2":"3rd floor","lon":-74.041794,"name":"Hoboken MakerBar","id":11759542,"state":"NJ","lat":40.737305,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.85547924042,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452721209000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>UPDATE: \u00a0NOTE Open Nights are now on Thursdays.<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nExplore electronics, coding, and creative technology at our monthly Micro-controller night.

Alejandra Menchaca, from the highly regarded Boston firm\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.payette.com\/\">Payette<\/a>, will travel\u00a0to NYC to present their research findings on how the impact of glazing selection can positively impact thermal comfort while reducing perimeter heating system requirements in the winter time.<\/p> <p>This talk will address two factors when designing glazed openings in cold climates: radiant discomfort and downdraft discomfort, and how each correlates to the glazing U-value, window geometry and the need for perimeter heating. It will cover the physics of glazing heat loss and its impact on comfort, as well as the decision-making process that needs to be followed to ensure a comfortable environment early in the design. In particular, Alejandra will address the impact that room-side low-e coatings, which significantly reduce the U-value of a glazing unit, can have on potential risk of downdraft.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/233\">- Click Here to Register -\u00a0<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Following the presentations, Yetsuh Frank from BEEx will pose a few questions, with time left for audience discussion.<\/p> <p><b>SPEAKER<br\/><\/b><b>Alejandra Menchaca,\u00a0<\/b>PhD, LEED AP<br\/>Senior Building Scientist | Associate<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/1\/6\/600_449159414.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/233\">- Click Here to Register -\u00a0<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYPassiveHouse-NYC\/events\/230551500\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":5400000,"name":"Glazing + Comfort: Presentation on New Research (BEEx Event)","id":"230551500","time":1463144400000,"updated":1463151262000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1257778915000,"name":"NY Passive House (NYPH) Meetup: New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1554052,"urlname":"NYPassiveHouse-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NYPH Supporters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"240 E 52nd St","name":"BRAZILIAN ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS","lon":-73.968422,"id":4545212,"state":"NY","lat":40.756378,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":1.2146781683,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462305038000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Friday, 13th May \u2013 Jorge Amado and Z\u00e9lia Gattai<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BEA Brazilian Endowment for the Arts Auditorium \u2013 240 E 52th, New York, NY 10022<\/b><\/p> <p><b>9:00- 10:00<\/b>\u2013 Z\u00e9lia Gattai , The woman of all kinds of arts \u2013 Roberto Amado, Brazilian Writer<\/p> <p><b>10:00-10:30<\/b>\u2013 Q &amp; A<\/p> <p><b>10:30-11:00<\/b>- Closing remarks<\/p> <p><b>11:00-14:00<\/b>\u2013 Lunch<\/p> <p><b>14:00-16:00<\/b>\u2013 Jubiab\u00e1, 1987, director Nelson Pereira dos Santos 107 min - Presentation by Roberto Amado and Dawn Taylor<\/p> <p><b>16:00 \u2013 16:30<\/b>\u00a0\u2013 Q &amp; A<\/p> <p><b>16:30 \u2013 17:00<\/b>\u00a0\u2013 Closing remarks<\/p> <p>\n\n\n*A percentage of your Barnes &amp; Noble purchases\u00a0between may 12-18, will benefit our organization.

Asana's are expressed both ways,so the student can find the expression that works best for their needs.<\/p> <p>Postures are modified into variations designed to fit each individuals needs.<br\/>Classes will be held in an atmosphere that is extraordinary, surrounded by beautiful stain glass windows inside the actual church. That will complement the tranquility and peace of our practice.These classes have no bearing on religious beliefs and are open to all.<br\/>Please join me at The All Saints Episcopal Church 2329 Victory Blvd. Staten Island, N.Y. 10314.<\/p> <p>Mondays and Fridays 11:00 am.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Class fee is $12, or $10 for seniors.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Core-Strength-and-Wellness-Yoga-on-Staten-Island\/events\/230949528\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Chair Yoga Class","id":"dhttbcyvhbrb","time":1463151600000,"updated":1463163305000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1272762214000,"name":"Yoga and Melody","group_lon":-74.1800003052,"id":1639292,"urlname":"Core-Strength-and-Wellness-Yoga-on-Staten-Island","group_lat":40.5400009155,"who":"Members, Yogis, Yoga lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"30 W. 8th Street","name":"Stumptown Coffee","lon":-73.998,"id":24384848,"lat":40.73275,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":1.26616132259,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461980276000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Academic-Writing-Meetup\/events\/230757649\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Let's Write","id":"zqmxslyvhbrb","time":1463151600000,"updated":1463178805000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440089005000,"name":"New York Academic Writing Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18851929,"urlname":"New-York-Academic-Writing-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Academic Writers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462939879000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>What a great #AIIM16 event in New Orleans!\u00a0 There were several topics discussed in the Chapter Leadership meetings as well and I think that it is great if we could all hop on a quick conference call Friday May 13th\u00a0at noon to discuss a few points.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>If you are interested in participating in the chapter revitalization, please say you are coming or send a private message. \u00a0I will send you the call information.<\/p> <p>In the interim:<\/p> <p>\u00a01.\u00a0If you have companies who would like to sponsor the chapter please let the group know<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0Also, please make sure you sign up and feel free to invite others to join on our AIIMNYC MeetUp site.<\/p> <p>If you are on the fence about volunteering or have a potential conflict but interested, please send me a message ASAP, I will not be able to handle last minute replies on this forum.<\/p> <p>I look forward to hearing from you.<\/p> <p>Thank you.<\/p> <p>John Schaffer<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AIIMNYC\/events\/231035431\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Revitalize Chapter Conference Call","id":"231035431","time":1463155200000,"updated":1463168235000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403944157000,"name":"AIIM Metro New York  Chapter","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":15371082,"urlname":"AIIMNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookyn","address_1":"95 Morgan Avenue ","name":"Body Art & Soul Tattoos","lon":-73.932335,"id":24539853,"state":"NY","lat":40.70713,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.23825359344,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455135644000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Friday the 13th, tattoo shops around the city and Brooklyn offer $13 flash tattoos with a $7 tip (bring cash). \u00a0The shop opens at 1pm, but these specials get busy very very quickly, and the longer you wait to show up, the longer you'll wait to get your tattoo.

We are told that this definition of time is intelligible only if we have eternity as a point of departure to understand the meaning of time. Yet, Heidegger believes that we are barred from such a viewpoint. We can only understand the phenomenon of time from our mortal or finite vantage point. Contrary to the tradition of philosophy, Heidegger argues that time does not find its meaning in eternity, time finds its meaning in death. However, death \u2014 like eternity \u2014 is never at our disposal to understand the phenomenon of time. Heidegger is aware that death is never an event in our life, he nonetheless claims that it is the awareness of our\u00a0finitude\u00a0that informs our understanding of time.<\/p> <p><br\/>WE WILL CREATE A SHORT VIDEO FOR YOUTUBE WITH 1 MIN OF YOUR TALK ABOUT PHENOMENA OF TIME<\/p> <p><b>After this event:<\/b><\/p> <p>7-10 pm<\/p> <p>Consciousness Simulation and our Cyber-Immortality Project<\/p> <p>We will review how to build a computer simulation system capable of simulating rational self-consciousness, including simulated \"free will\" and human-like capacities to emerge as new properties in the virtual reality.

Yet, Heidegger believes that we are barred from such a viewpoint. We can only understand the phenomenon of time from our mortal or finite vantage point. Contrary to the tradition of philosophy, Heidegger argues that time does not find its meaning in eternity, time finds its meaning in death. However, death \u2014 like eternity \u2014 is never at our disposal to understand the phenomenon of time. Heidegger is aware that death is never an event in our life, he nonetheless claims that it is the awareness of our finitude that informs our understanding of time.<\/p> <p>WE WILL CREATE A SHORT VIDEO FOR YOUTUBE WITH 1 MIN OF YOUR TALK ABOUT PHENOMENA OF TIME<\/p> <p>7-10 PM<\/p> <p><b>Consciousness Simulation and our Cyber-Immortality Project<\/b><\/p> <p>We will review how to build a computer simulation system capable of simulating rational self-consciousness, including simulated \"free will\" and human-like capacities to emerge as new properties in the virtual reality.

His journeys take us from Ukraine to Iran, Mongolia to North Korea, Panama City to Dubai, and the Arctic Circle to the South China Sea\u2014all to show how 21st century conflict is a tug-of-war over pipelines and Internet cables, advanced technologies and market access.<\/p> <p>\n\nYet Connectography is a hopeful vision of the future. Khanna argues that new energy discoveries and innovations have eliminated the need for resource wars, global financial assets are being deployed to build productive infrastructure that can reduce inequality, and frail regions such as Africa and the Middle East are unscrambling their fraught colonial borders through ambitious new transportation corridors and power grids. Beneath the chaos of a world that appears to be falling apart is a new foundation of connectivity pulling it together.<\/p> <p><b>About Connectography<\/b>, which debuts April 19 and is on sale at our event:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paragkhanna.com\/connectography\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.paragkhanna.com\/connectography<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/7\/600_448921815.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Parag\u00a0<\/b><b>Khanna<\/b> is a leading global strategist, world traveler, and best-selling author.

The second night of this four-night series will host three performances; \u201cExtraordinary Ability\u201d by Veronica Pe\u00f1a, \u201cBags\u201d by Giacomo Colosi, and \u201cDe lo Ajeno (Of Others)\u201d by Hector Canonge and Veronica Pe\u00f1a on May 13th, 2016 at Rabbithole Projects.<\/p> <p>\u201cAlien Of Extraordinary Ability\u201d is a performance that explores issues related to migration, cultural identity, and border politics. Inspired by the process of applying for an O1 visa in the United States, and using American stereotypes of the Spanish culture, Ver\u00f3nica Pe\u00f1a creates a performance that brings the audience into an interview with an embassy immigration officer. Using Spanish traditions, the artist creates a performance where the audience is, as a group and as individuals, engaged in a series of questions that immigrants are asked in order to be granted permission to enter the United States. Born in Spain and based in the United States, \u00a0Veronica Pe\u00f1a\u2019s work explores themes of absence, separation, and the search for harmony through performance art. Her recent work consists of experimental participatory performances that create shared moments amongst strangers. Pe\u00f1a earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts at The Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. She earned her Master of Fine Arts at Stony Brook University, New York, focusing on installation and performance art. Pe\u00f1a has exhibited in Spain, Germany, Italy, South Korea, and United States.<\/p> <p>\u201cBags\u201d is an ongoing performance that investigates the limits between art and life. Using a raw, humorous, and absurd style, Giacomo Colosi displays his personal bag collection, accessories he used until they were no longer wearable and that have become part of his personal belongings archive since 1998. During the performance, Colosi chooses one bag at a time, exposing all the contents found on each of the them. He invites the audience to be part of his memory process where each bag represent a stage of his life, a particular experience, or a particular place. He creates a synergy with his environment and encourages participants to revisit their own memories based on their personal belongings. Born in Messina, Italy, and based in New Jersey, Giacomo Colosi is an independent performance and video artist whose work explores concepts of absence, personal memories, and vulnerability. Colosi has performed at art festivals all around Italy including Arte Contemporanea en Movimiento (2005), Festival Internazionale del Teatro in Piazza (2010), C.E.R.P. Le Arti In Citta Perugia Contemporanea (2007). Colosi has also performed in collaboration with Frieze Projects at Frieze Art Fair (2009), Biennale di Venezia, Nordic Pavilion (2009) and Non-Dancers performance at the Whitney Biennial (2012).<\/p> <p>\u201cDe Lo Ajeno (Of Others)\u201d \u00a0is a performance that explores Hispanic stereotypes in relation to national and personal identity. Based on perceptions that Americans have of Spanish and Latino cultures, and taking into account the historic ties between Spain and South America, artists Ver\u00f3nica Pe\u00f1a and Hector Canonge, create a performance that establishes possible dialogues and readings of otherness. Using references and appropriating popular Hispanic traditions and practices, the artists create a dynamic performative environment where games of passion, power, control, domination, conquest, and mutual understanding are proposed. The performance consists of five actions marked by movement, sound, and the use of artifacts created by the artists. Every action evokes a moment and personal experience of the artists\u2019 lives in the United States. Hector Canonge is an interdisciplinary artist, curator, educator, and cultural entrepreneur based in New York City. His work incorporates the use of new media technologies, cinematic narratives, LHive Action Art, and Social Practice to explore and treat issues related to constructions of identity, gender roles, psychogeography, and the politics of migration. \u00a0Canonge started projects such as ARTerial Performance Lab (APLAB), an initiative to foster collaboration among performance artists from the Americas, PERFORMEANDO, a program that focuses on featuring Hispanic performance artists living in the USA and Europe, NEXUSURNEXUS a virtual platform for Live Action Art, and PERFORMAXIS, an international residency program in collaboration with galleries and art spaces in Latin America. He created, and organizes independently the annual Performance Art Festival NYC, ITINERANT.<\/p> <p>The Espejo Organization for the Arts is a Bushwick-based arts management organization that is committed to promote the artistic endeavors of mid-career and emerging international artists and creatives. This performance art night is part of EOarts Performance Art Series 2016, an action art program that aims to survey international performance art practices and bring them closer to the public.\u201cThrough this performance art series we aim to offer an open and inviting platform where international artists and the public can meet. We want to invite the audience to participate in and engage with performance art, understanding better what this art medium is really about: the power of symbolic action.\u201d said Kika Espejo, founder and director of the the organization.<\/p> <p>The Rabbithole Projects Gallery, an art space located on the waterfront of the Dumbo Arts District in Brooklyn, will host EOarts Performance Art Series 2016. \u201cOur goal is to provide the space and community access for talented artists to share their dreams, visions, and creations with inspired attendees. This performance art series will be an unforgettable experience,\u201d said Shawn Lyons, Owner of Rabbithole Projects. \u201cWe are incredibly excited to host such an intriguing event.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/contemporary-art-practice-nyc\/events\/230872542\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"EOarts Performance Art Series.

This should be a fun meetup. This is not an Amateur or Gimmick Comedy show, Dangerfields features best of the best comedians who have performed in leading clubs, motion pictures and tv shows such as Tonight Show with Jay leno, Jimmy Fallon, Letterman, Seth meyers, Conan and Comedy Central. HBO's most successful comedy TV specials were taped at this club.<\/p> <p>Im very excited to have the meetup here, We are getting tickets that are $40.00 each free for this group, its a 2 drink minimum as in any other club but if you get a drink at the bar before the show it counts toward the drink minimum which is very rare for a comedy club and theres a full food menu. If you want to just stop by have a drink and meet your fellow meetup members and not stay for the show you can do that too youll still get a ticket if you wanna use it for another time.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there. This weeks is hosted by Q (Quinten Heggs), Lineup included Ryan Reiss (Comedy Central), Lenny Marcus (Comedy Central), Keith Anthony, Mike Britt (Showtime!), Steve Marshall (AXS), Al D. (TruTV) more will be named.<\/p> <p>Ive personally never been to this club, but the Organizer will have a meetup sign, we all sit together, and meet each other so look for the meetup sign and the organizer will give you the Free Tickets.<\/p> <p>Show Starts at 8:30, so come at 7:45 to meet your fellow meetup members!

When a scientist experimenting with a new form of organ transplants kills a young female resident of a fortress-like apartment complex before subsequently committing suicide, the investigation into her death leads to a frightening discovery. Originally conceived by the misguided scientist in a bid to aid organ transplant, an overzealous parasite quickly escapes into the complex in search of a host. One by one, the unsuspecting residents fall prey to the parasite, and the result is an aggressive horde of sex maniacs who will stop at nothing to satisfy their primal lust and pass the infection on through sexual contact. When the resident doctor learns the sinister truth behind the malevolent creation, only one man stands between an apartment complex overflowing with id-driven zombies and the outside world. Will he be able to stop the rapidly spreading parasite before it escapes into society, or is it only a matter of time until he, too, falls prey to its rapturous effects and gives in to the temptations of the flesh?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eK9Wal9Dvic\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eK9Wal9Dvic<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/230852970\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Shivers 35mm film print movie starts at 9:15pm","id":"230852970","time":1463185800000,"updated":1463942768000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"08840","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Metuchen","address_1":"215 Durham Avenue","name":"Metuchen Sportsplex","lon":-74.371872,"id":8697892,"state":"NJ","lat":40.542461,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":36,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6755084991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1462633383000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You'll notice this event is now listed as three hours - while you certainly don't have to play that long, from this point forward, GMAVC has the keys to the building, so we can PLAY TIL WE DROP!

It offers everything from a scenic overlook of expansive forests, a path sheltered by hemlocks next to a gurgling creek, to bog areas which contain some plants not common to Pennsylvania.<\/p> <p><br\/>The plan is to leave NYC around 8:00 am on Saturday, drive 100 miles on I-80 West, and meet at Dunkin' Donuts in Blakeslee around 9:45-10:00 am. We regroup and drive together from there to the trail head.<\/p> <p><br\/>The hike will be strenuous in a difficult terrain (possibly boulders on the trail and wet areas) carrying heavy backpacks. Be prepared for rain, bugs and cold weather. Everyone is responsible for themselves. You have to bring your own gear (tent, sleeping bag, stove, food, water filter, etc.), but we may share some items when possible.<\/p> <p>Please sign up on the waiting list and as we get more drivers I'll move you to the Yes column.

This is the perfect opportunity to grow our group, meet thousands of new &amp; expectant dads, and share our experiences\/best practices.<\/p> <p>We hope to recruit lots of our nyc dads group members to volunteer and help us out in the dads lounge over the course of the weekend.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

From parking head south along the cliff and catch the aqua blazed Long Path (LP). Shortly after reaching the LP turn left on the blue\/white blazed Forest Trail and descend steep terrain on a series of switchbacks and stairs. At end of trail, turn left on the white blazed Shore Trail. The trail soon reaches a difficult, rocky area known as Giant Stairs. Be careful here as some rocks are not stable. After about a mile of rocks, you reach flat ground and pass Peanut Leap Falls (impressive after a rain, a trickle otherwise) and some ruins. Trail climbs here and reaches the LP again. For a more strenuous, scenic route, turn left on LP, cross bridge, climb steep section and return to parking. For an easier return, continue straight on LP to a distinct, unmarked trail that leaves to left (sign says To Park Office). Take this. At end turn left onto old Rt 9W (closed to vehicles) and return to parking lot.<\/p> <p><b>Depending on the size of the group we may split up into two groups to allow the group hike at their own pace.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>GPS COORDINATES MAY BE OFF A BIT SO FOLLOW DRIVING DIRECTIONS:<\/b><\/p> <p>Take the Palisades Interstate Park north from the George Washington Bridge.

Designing for this new medium is less a challenge of technology than imagination. Sharing a rich set of examples, designer and author Josh Clark explores the new experiences that are possible when ANYTHING can be an interface. The digital manipulation of physical objects (and vice versa) effectively turns all of us into wizards. Sling content between devices, bring objects to life from a distance, weave \"spells\" by combining speech and gesture. But magic doesn't have to be otherworldly; the UX of connected devices should build on the natural physical interactions we have everyday with the world around us. The new UX must bend technology to the way we live our lives, not the reverse.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Shallow Interaction Patterns for Deeper Human Experiences<br\/><i>Kieran Evans and Jes Koepfler\u00a0<\/i><\/b><i>(<a href=\"http:\/\/interaction16.ixda.org\/speakers\/kieran-evans\/\">Kieran's Biography<\/a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/interaction16.ixda.org\/speakers\/jes-koepfler\/\">Jes's Biography<\/a>)<\/i><\/p> <p>Shallow interaction design is a new way of thinking about human-computer interaction. We define shallow interaction design as the patterns and features of an experience that promote surface-level interactions with technology devices to minimize distraction. In this session, we will discuss how we applied shallow interaction design in Extreme Event, a social game that teaches players about disaster resilience. We\u2019ll describe and demonstrate 6 shallow patterns that we used in the creation of this game to ensure that digital interactions played only a supporting role to the human-to-human interaction. We\u2019ll conclude with a group discussion about other domains, such as healthcare and wearables, where shallow interactions will play a critical role in the future.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Invisible Cities<br\/><i>Pablo Honey<\/i><\/b><i> (<a href=\"http:\/\/interaction16.ixda.org\/speakers\/pablo-honey\/\">Biography<\/a>)<\/i><\/p> <p>Cities have always been the driving forces behind the economic and cultural development of a region, a country or a continent. But one thing does distinguish this day and age: the speed of that development. And the most radical booster of that speed is the upshot of the internet, an innovation that is only 40 years old.<\/p> <p>Big cities will be developing into megacities, and today\u2019s megacities will turn into super-megacities. Specially in these ever-changing metropolis we are seeing the interplay of different trends tapping into mobility, robotics or energy.<\/p> <p>But every institution is following an isolated agenda, rather than a collective effort to tackle the challenges of those future cities.<\/p> <p>This talk is meant to give an holistic view to how the cities are changing and how as Experience Designers we can enhance the physical and digital spaces that we live in.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Learning from Live Systems (Opening Keynote)<br\/><i>Josh Seiden<\/i><\/b><i> (<a href=\"http:\/\/interaction16.ixda.org\/speakers\/joshua-seiden\/\">Biography<\/a>)<\/i><\/p> <p>At Interaction '11 in Boulder Colorado Dick Buchanan told us that an interaction is \"how people relate to other people through the mediating influence of products.\"<\/p> <p>Earlier, at Interaction '09 in Vancouver, Robert Fabricant told us, that \"interaction design is not about computing technology.\" Instead, he argued that \"Behavior is our medium.\"<\/p> <p>These statements have become uncontroversial in the world of interaction design, and yet when we talk about design methods, we still talk about methods for designing products and for human-computer interfaces. We have a body of methods to design products (the \"mediating influences\") but very few tools and approaches available to work with the larger systems of interaction.<\/p> <p>Recently though, we've seen teams having success with methods that blend Service Design, Lean Startup, and Lean UX methods into what I call \"Learning From Live Systems\" approach. By launching services early and powering them with a mix of software and human \"concierge\" services, teams are able to develop and test systems even as they are under construction.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ladies-That-UX-NYC\/events\/230562437\/","yes_rsvp_count":75,"duration":21600000,"name":"The Interaction16 Redux","id":"230562437","time":1463238000000,"updated":1463274619000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1404248474000,"name":"Ladies That UX NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":15441932,"urlname":"Ladies-That-UX-NYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Ladies That UX"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"15 E. 18th St.","name":"Taralucci et Vino","lon":-73.990814,"id":19248442,"state":"NY","lat":40.738144,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0.822031974792,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461299235000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are invited to join <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/womenofculture\/\">Women of Culture<\/a> for an afternoon of history, herstory, art and architecture.

They range in height from 9 feet (2.7 m) to the 94-foot (29 m) Ganoga Falls. Ricketts Glen State Park is named for R. Bruce Ricketts, a colonel in the American Civil War who owned over 80,000 acres (32,000 ha) in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but spared the old-growth forests in the glens from clearcutting. The park, which opened in 1944, is administered by the Bureau of State Parks of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR). Nearly all of the waterfalls are visible from the Falls Trail, which Ricketts had built from 1889 to 1893 and which the state park rebuilt in the 1940s and late 1990s. The Falls Trail has been called \"the most magnificent hike in the state\" and one of \"the top hikes in the East\".<\/p> <p><b>ATTRACTIONS:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Adam's Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6b\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Adams_Falls_4.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Kitchen Creek Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Kitchen_Creek_Falls_3-edited-.jpg\/1024px-Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Kitchen_Creek_Falls_3-edited-.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Shingle Cabin Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Ozone_Falls_8.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Murray Reynolds Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/2643\/i\/2012\/248\/e\/f\/me_and_murray_reynolds_falls_by_leelee_x3-d5dobjv.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Sheldon Reynolds Falls<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/gowaterfalling.com\/waterfalls\/images\/full\/pa\/sheldonreynoldsfalls2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Harrison Wright Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/gowaterfalling.com\/waterfalls\/images\/full\/pa\/harrisonwrightfalls1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Wyandot Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b3\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Oneida_Falls_1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Benjamin Reynolds Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/gowaterfalling.com\/waterfalls\/images\/full\/pa\/vbreynoldsfalls.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Robert Bruce Ricketts<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/55248d95e4b0b0f379634891\/t\/56fbda322fe131fa488fea91\/1459345979961\/vsco-photo-3.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ozone Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d0\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Ozone_Falls_3.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Huron Falls<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/_-rpMcGsgiFQ\/ShdfpHbN4DI\/AAAAAAAADyQ\/0mSD82y164c\/s640\/Huron%20Falls%20(12).JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/_-rpMcGsgiFQ\/ShdfpHbN4DI\/AAAAAAAADyQ\/0mSD82y164c\/s640\/Huron%20Falls%20(12).JPG<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Shawnee Falls<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a5\/Ricketts_Glen_State_Park_Shawnee_Falls_4.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Frank L.

We will look more closely at the Buddhist teachings regarding our common belief that we are an individual, separate \"self\" versus a deeper realization and understanding of our true nature being an interdependent and\u00a0interconnected part of the whole universe.<\/p> <p><br\/>We know from the Four Noble Truths that the goal of meditative practice is to end the suffering that exists in life for each of us. \u00a0From the teachings we are invited to investigate and awaken to who we really are at the deepest levels. Once we notice that our belief in an independent and separate self makes anything that isn't \"us\" a possible threat, we can understand why we constantly struggle with anger, craving, jealousy, pride and ignorance as we navigate the world with other beings and experiences.\u00a0<\/p> <p>From those many struggles we develop our \"rules of engagement\" that strongly influence all of our life choices from what we wear, with whom we associate, to what we do for work. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having inner confidence about our life, but the teachings suggest that we are identifying with an incomplete or even wrong version of ourselves.<\/p> <p>Over the next few weeks we'll look at what the Buddha explained as the five aggregates, or groups, or bundles of things that work together to form the sense of self. These teachings are fundamental in Buddhism and provide a window into how our relationship with the \"self\" is constructed.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

Long Island City (LIC) is quickly becoming a beer and food haven and I want to explore all it's got to offer. \u00a0The plan is to visit 3 of the LIC breweries and the beer\/food outdoor market, LIC Flea &amp; Food. \u00a0These breweries' tasting rooms are small so I have to cap this event. \u00a0The rough plan for the day is as follows:<\/p> <p><b>Noonish: LIC Flea &amp; Food<\/b>- this is an outdoor market with food, beer, shops, and even some games to play. \u00a0Ideally, get something to eat here before the beer tastings begins. \u00a0We'll spend some time here gathering the troops, eating, and doing whatever else.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>1pm: Rockaway Brewery<\/b>- \u00a0this brewery is across the street from LIC Flea &amp; Food. \u00a0These beers you can easily find all around NYC as they are the biggest of the LIC breweries. \u00a0The tasting room is small and hot but dammit, we aren't at a spa, we are here to taste some beer!<\/p> <p><b>2:30pm: Big Alice Brewing Company<\/b>- about a 10 min walk north long the river will get us to the most experimental brewery in LIC. \u00a0They are making some really weird beers so the tasting flight is the way to go here. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>4pm: LIC Beer Project<\/b>- a 15 min walk will get us to the brewery I'm most excited about. \u00a0They specialize in wild yeast so be prepared for a tap menu full of sours, farmhouse ales, and saisons. \u00a0This tasting room is a little bigger than the last ones but it will likely still be tight. \u00a0<\/p> <p>It will be likely be around dinner time when we are done with the crawl so people can split up and do what they like: hit some local spot for food, hit up another bar, go home and sleep, whatever. \u00a0We'll see where the day takes us. \u00a0These times are super rough, I go with the flow and how everyone is feeling. \u00a0I will post when we move in case anyone gets lost.<\/p> <p>Cash is going to make your life much easier. \u00a0I know a couple of these spots have a credit card minimum and a tasting flight doesn't make the minimum.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Subways<\/b>: Arriving to the event is easiest via the Vernon Blvd 7 stop. \u00a0The Court Sq.

We will focus on short stories, flash fiction, novels\/novellas, poetry, creative non-fiction\/memoir, with some participants having the end goal of putting together book-length manuscripts. This is a speculative fiction group so the work should be in the magical realist, surrealist, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. genres. American Gothic and poetic memoir would fall into these categories. This group is broad and is a good space to submit works that may not fall clearly into a set format. <\/b><\/p> <p>For the first group, please submit a 3-5-page sample and a mission statement\/end goal. I am putting together a shared Google drive to distribute the work to everyone who will be attending the meeting.<\/p> <p>We will follow stories, chapters from novels, poems, pieces\/vignettes, flash works that center around a shared world or set of characters so that we can support each other's progress throughout the process of creating either the finished manuscript or working on separate pieces. If you are already in a novel group, you are welcome to bring another novel or a different work to this meeting, but please don't submit a novel that is already being critiqued by a novel group.<\/p> <p>The format will be slightly different than the critique groups that utilize the Clarion method. Everyone will have the chance to participate and give critiques. When submitting a piece for the first time, the author will let us know what their vision is for the finished manuscript: approximate length, overarching themes, goals during the writing process, what their driving force is for writing this manuscript. When submitting the work for critique, the author will write three questions\/areas that they would like readers to focus on or special challenges they have had in writing. During the meeting itself, the critique process will follow the same rules of respect and constructive criticism as the other meetings. The only difference will be that everyone will talk in their own time: we will not go around the circle in the set fashion of the CM but will listen to critiques coming from whoever would like to speak. The author will be silent for the duration of the critique and then have the chance to ask the group any questions based on the comments they heard.<\/p> <p>Page count per submission and per meeting will be the same as for the other critique groups:<\/p> <p>7,500-word limit\/submission<\/p> <p>28,000-word limit\/meeting<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers\/events\/229688053\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"Blurring the Lines: New Multi-Format Critique Group","id":"bdmzqlyvhbqb","time":1463241600000,"updated":1463403417000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1278875895000,"name":"Brooklyn Speculative Fiction Writers","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1673851,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"writers of speculative fiction"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11368","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Flushing","address_1":"123-01 Roosevelt Avenue","name":"Citi Field","lon":-73.849075,"id":5745322,"state":"Ne","lat":40.755917,"repinned":false},"headcount":39,"distance":7.40221309662,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460138435000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>RSVP only if you are coming Saturday.

More than a million people visit the food festival each year. It\u2019s unique and amazing, celebrating the joys of ethnicity through food, entertainment and every kind of street fair stall.<\/p> <p>The food is the big draw, but the festival is a fabulous expression of the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood \u2013 teeming with ethnic food shops and fine restaurants and offering an eclectic global smorgasbord of national and regional foods. Outside venders participate as well, but the Ninth Avenue merchants and restaurants and the community organizations of Hell\u2019s Kitchen are out in all their neighborhood glory.<\/p> <p>To find me I will be waiting in front of the Starbucks. I will stay there for about 10 to 15 minutes. If we grow bored of the festival we will move to a nearby park, or walk around exploring the area.
