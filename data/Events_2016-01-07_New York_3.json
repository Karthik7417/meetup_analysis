Each city-state will defend its own, but outside that, help is not easy to come by.

The gods are powerful and wise, but fickle they are, too, and to understand their ways is not the way of man.<\/p> <p>This is no place for the weak of heart.

It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p><b>Personal Branding with Purpose<\/b> is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand. It's about learning how to live your personal brand by sharing your authentic self and communicating clearly the value you can provide others. Our passions, talents, and impact are unique gifts we can give to the world. By learning how to market these gifts through personal branding, you create not only career and business opportunities but also a greater capacity to make a difference in the lives of others and the planet.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/XjaGwoyHDOa1tMS10zWAGOiyWigrldG9oUBFs6bn6ElHOp2HTskwwF7gfMUJgCVzz-_7VHUxNcGzcq7UsfUUSTawbroK8ZDaFIiAbx_O9qHe8ljAx_3D_T0dPmwNVnMNjc00ydwQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/XjaGwoyHDOa1tMS10zWAGOiyWigrldG9oUBFs6bn6ElHOp2HTskwwF7gfMUJgCVzz-_7VHUxNcGzcq7UsfUUSTawbroK8ZDaFIiAbx_O9qHe8ljAx_3D_T0dPmwNVnMNjc00ydwQ<\/a><\/p> <p>Join us before and after the workshop to enjoy a <b>Happy Hour <\/b>with our space partners, <a href=\"http:\/\/tillandsprocket.com\/\"><b>Till &amp; Sprocket<\/b><\/a>!

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/226905638\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Anime Dragon Ball Z Movies  -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlytqbtb","time":1450220400000,"updated":1450232406000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11210","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"220 Cadman Plaza West","name":"Park Plaza Diner","lon":-73.991493,"id":238311,"state":"NY","lat":40.697693,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.62242817879,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449072473000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>___<\/b><b>___<\/b><b>___<\/b><b>___<\/b><b>___<\/b><b>___<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Dean C.

The challenges of the early-stage company, MotionTraxx, and tactics used by this month's growth company, Spotify, was very helpful in helping me extract lessons learned. In learning about practical approaches to product management, I'm able to better utilize my own product management toolbox to further develop an effective, productive and efficient product management system for our company.

The meetup is on the 67th floor.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>What is Set Theory:<\/p> <p>ZFC set theory is an axiomatic\u00a0theory of sets. The reason for such a theory is that one wants a \"definition\" of what a set is. The reason that sets are important to mathematics is that they provide an encoding of most of\u00a0mathematics (there are a couple of reasons why one cannot encode all of math).<\/p> <p>Why Learn about Set Theory:<\/p> <p>Axiomatic set theories provide the theoretical underpinnings of various subjects of interest to programmers and computer scientists. For instance relational database theory. Moreover Lisp\/scheme programmers very often use set theoretic notions (I would argue that Lisp\/Scheme are in fact founded in set theory). ZFC set theory in particular acts as an assembly language for most of mathematics. Moreover, the central philosophical idea that comes out of set theory is that one may take a collection of objects (not necessarily OPP objects) and treat them as unitary objects. It is also interesting to note the quite a few of the axioms of ZFC come naturally out of common functional constructs such as Append, Filter, and Map.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What I will be Discussing:<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will discuss the theory of ZFC set theory, it's raison d'etre (to be pretentious), as well as some applications (time permitting). Some F# code will also be shown that illustrates the axioms of ZFC.<\/p> <p>Optional Preparation:<\/p> <p>Listen to the Functional Geekery Podcast: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.functionalgeekery.com\/episode-37-eric-smith\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.functionalgeekery.com\/episode-37-eric-smith\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.functionalgeekery.com\/episode-37-eric-smith\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>While he does not mention set theory by name, Set theory is in fact part of the history that he speaks about.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Sign in at the visitor desk on the first floor.

Yep, I'm addressing those of you---among our 200 members---who have yet to get personally involved since you \"signed up\" here with \"HCx3DP Meetup NY.\"\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is still our official name...even though we've invested the last seven or eight months in a key, innovative subset of \"HCx3DP...\" That is \"Health Maker Lab\"---HML, for short.<\/b><\/p> <p>Bear with me! In this update,\u00a0I'm going to present additional (compelling!!) reasons for you to commit more of your time and attention to HML. I think in many cases, your free-will commitment likely comes down---in the main---to the appeal of our evolving strategies. And, how---despite\u00a0this world full of so much choice---they complement your own interests .<\/p> <p>Fair enough. Since some of you joined our Meetup Community, we HAVE changed our targets and readjusted our focus. Health Maker Lab is BOTH broader and narrower than HCx3DP.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Broader in that we've expanded \"3DP\" to Digital Fabrication---or, DigiFab. You know as well as I that tech of every kind is evolving at lightning speed. 3D Printing is an important subset of DigiFab---especially when applied to Healthcare solutions. BUT, there are effective ways and means beyond 3DP to deliver those novel and necessary answers. Especially if we're thinking \"Big Tent.\"<\/p> <p>Narrower in that we've\u00a0drilling down to determine the most effective of our ultimate HML solutions. Those solutions that will best meet the needs of specific patient, client or recipient communities for improved health---in a larger compass of that phrase. From our HML Community to the larger local community by narrowing our \"envisioning\" to integrate appropriate solutions. Even if they are NOT the traditional modes of \"modern\" medicine.<\/p> <p><b><i>Big Tent---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Now---as this post's title suggests---our HML operational strategy includes putting up a Big Tent and inviting disparate interests (yours!) to enter in expectation and join in our convocation successfully. At this point, we will be hard put to keep our internal HML Action Centers to eight or 10. And, to address the needs of \"only\" five or six external neighborhood partner or player populations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Internally, diverse Action Centers will promote the cross-pollination of new and novel ideas. Leading to what we hope are effective hybrid solutions in Healthcare.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Externally, serving the varied needs of sometimes competing neighborhood interest groups and organizations (\"Hood Hubs!\") WILL add to the complexity of our interfaces, relationships and connections. Human interactions ARE usually \"messy.\" (As Miss Frizzle of \"The Magic School Bus\" admonishes those who would produce scientific creativity: \"Take chances; make mistakes; get messy.\") We will have to inform our out-facing perspectives with common-good POVs commonly shared.<\/p> <p><b><i>GeoPrint---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our HML \"action footprint\" on the maps of our overlapping communities---our GeoPrint---are likely to be rather fluid. Especially to start. The interests of our HML Community, donors and partners and Healthcare recipients will ensure some curious GeoPrint \"gerrymandering.\" At least until we can rationalize our efforts---from (eventually) adequate resources.<\/p> <p>Our startup GeoPrint will (likely!) center in Brooklyn---the \"Techreative\" Borough. Our initial home-base will (likely!) reside in the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT). That's DUMBO (the City's official \"Digital District\"), the Brooklyn Navy Yard (335 tech-driven startups and ramp-ups) and Downtown Brooklyn (14 higher ed institutions and 60K students). A rich stew of assets that will help us to launch successfully. (I've lived and worked in Brooklyn for over 35 years and I can vouch for its base of resources---in our pursuit of a new kind of Health.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>From the BTT, we'll (likely!) spread in Brownstone and Riparian (East River) BK and east into UltraUrban East New York and Brownsville. Neighborhoods of high health needs. NYC enjoys 55 major Healthcare facilities. The self-selected among these will act as our first\u00a0Hood Hubs\u00a0among equals. We are---after all---focused on Health and hospitals strive to deliver that uncommon commodity.<\/p> <p>Donors and partners---action resources---may drive the expansion of our GeoPrint in unpredictable directions. It is possible that interested players in northern New Jersey could influence our development there---before, say, The Bronx or Staten Island. Certainly, the TriState Region is a natural GeoPrint extension for HML. After that...the world?!!<\/p> <p><b><i>Viral Ecosystem---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Health Maker Lab is intent on prototyping its inspirations, ideas and innovations in an initial \"sandbox\" location. We'll play with the combinations that fascinate and foster the most promising solutions to diverse needs. The most \u00a0certain possibilities are the certainty of the unexpected.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As an antidote to negative results, we will call on our Advisory Council (eventually 15 in number) of proven players. These advisors---the bases for our Action Centers---will keep us progressing appropriately to a stable ecosystem at our first HML location.<\/p> <p>At that breakout point, we envision a kind of viral HML \"reproduction\" regimen will commence. Successful ways and means, models and modes and---most importantly---trained and experienced cadre will empower rapid growth (likely?) within New York City.<\/p> <p><b>+++<\/b><\/p> <p>These expectations will indeed require good people to achieve.

This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/227024139\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytqbtb","time":1450222200000,"updated":1450234031000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"White Plains","address_1":"181 Mammaroneck Avenue","name":"Ron Black's","lon":-73.764442,"id":19105072,"state":"NY","lat":41.028366,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.6006546021,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447253930000,"fee":{"amount":6,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are personally invited to the Holiday Party!<\/p> <p>Come hang out and network in a more relaxed atmosphere.

The clear must ferments slowly in 500-liter oak barrels so it becomes quite stable naturally. It matured in those oak barrels for 14-15 months. It has a Burgundian nose, with subtle oak and orange peel, hints of pollen, and beeswax. The palate is very fresh, the grapes were harvested quite early to keep the acidity. The wine ends quite austere. Only part of it went through malolactic fermentation.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Chacra Barda Pinot Noir (Rio Negro, Patagonia)\u00a0 $25<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 91<\/i> \u2013 Pure, minerally and powerful, with concentrated flavors of red plum and dried raspberry, loaded with powerful meaty notes.

It is very much about the soil, not much about the fruit, but its youth is revealed in the notes of the elevage that are still there: that is cedar wood, peat and graphite. Summarizing, this is an austere, serious, long, tight red that has great potential to age. Drink 2015-2020.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Bodega Aleanna El Enemigo Bonarda (Valle de Uco, Mendoza)\u00a0 $27<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 90<\/i> \u2013 Ripe, rich, and intense, with impressive concentration to the raspberry, dark plum, and kirsch flavors. Very svelte, delivering luscious licorice and spice notes, which linger on the finish with baker's chocolate details.<\/p> <p><b>2006 Carmelo Patti Cabernet Sauvignon (Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon from Perdriel shows orange tints denoting its age. Carmelo Patti likes to release his wines after a long aging in the winery, when he thinks they are ready to drink. There are plenty of aromas of tea leaves, paprika, hints of leather and cured meat plus dried flowers and something earthy. The austere palate shows fully resolved tannins. There is nothing lush about this wine. This superb classically styled Cabernet is tasty, long, and ready to drink. If you want to see what Cabernet can do in Argentina this is a good example. This is like time-traveling.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Achaval Ferrer Quimera (Mendoza)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 The 2010 Quimera is a blend of Malbec, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon, alongside Petit Verdot and Merlot, raised in 40% French new oak for 14 months, the remainder one year old. It has a complex, almost \u201cmulchy\u201d bouquet: one that evokes undergrowth and tertiary aromas that are well-defined and cerebral. The palate is medium-bodied with fine, slightly chewy tannins surrounding a core of blackberry laced with licorice and a hint of star anise. The finish is focused and taut, bestowed with an extremely fresh citric finish. Old World meets New \u2013 with style.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17\/20 \u2013<\/i> Smart and a touch smoky over pure deep spiced blueberry fruit. A firm but polite grip in these sophisticated tannins. Fresh, deep and long. Delicious and worth the money, thanks to the savoury, mineral elegance allied to all that purity of fruit. Finishes beautifully dry.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group\/events\/226972728\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Argentina ABM (Anything But Malbec)","id":"226972728","time":1450224000000,"updated":1450293181000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432265288000,"name":"NYC Gay Men's Wine Dinner Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18616490,"urlname":"NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 18th St","name":"WeWork","lon":-73.995644,"id":24256081,"state":"NY","lat":40.740368,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.729847252369,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449004465000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"2nd Floor.

Film Society Lincoln Center\u2019s Convergence Series and StoryCode are thrilled to welcome Gabo Arora and Socrates Kakoulides who will present the work of this innovative VR series.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/7\/1\/600_444647473.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The United Nations Millennium Campaign created the Virtual Reality Series to bring the world's most pressing challenges home to decision makers and global citizens around the world, pushing the bounds of empathy. Building upon its mandate to amplify the voices of those who are often unheard, particularly the world's most vulnerable, the project seeks to show the human story behind development challenges identified by millions of people around the world.<\/p> <p>By showcasing VR experiences the UNMC is trying to help people with the power to make a difference have a deeper understanding of their world, and to hopefully act to make a difference.<\/p> <p>In addition to showcasing the VR experience at high-level UN meetings, the UNMC is working with partners to create advocacy platforms, awareness and fundraising campaigns.<\/p> <p>For the December StoryCode NYC Forum Gabo and Socrates will be presenting two projects from the VR Series: Clouds Over Sidra and Waves of Grace.<\/p> <p><b><i>Clouds Over Sidra<br\/><\/i><\/b><i>Clouds Over Sidra<\/i> follows a twelve year old in the Za\u2019atari camp in Jordan - home to 84,000 Syrian refugees. It follows her to school, to her makeshift tent and even to the football pitch. It's the first ever film shot in virtual reality for the UN, using the medium to generate greater empathy and new perspectives on people living in conditions of great vulnerability. The film\u2019s powerful capacity to allow anyone on a global scale experience life within a refugee camp has the ability to inspire the message of hope amongst not only the millions displaced but also those motivated to act.<\/p> <p>The film premiered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland with supporters including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg among other dignitaries.<\/p> <p><b><i>Waves of Grace<\/i><\/b><br\/><i>Waves of Grace<\/i> captures a young woman\u2019s struggle for life amid an Ebola epidemic. After surviving a bout with the deadly disease that stole the lives of her family, Decontee, a Liberian native, uses her immunity to help children orphaned by Ebola. This VR experience follows the Liberian tragedy from illness to recovery, mourning to perseverance. Waves of Grace illustrates the lasting impact of the Ebola crisis, as well as the need for continuing support for those affected by the disease.<\/p> <p>The movie was filmed in the West Point township of Liberia\u2019s capital, Monrovia. It is one of the most densely populated slums in the capital and was quarantined by the Liberian government for 13 days during the height of the epidemic. It was released at the Secretary-General\u2019s International Ebola Recovery Conference, which raised $5.2 billion in pledges.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/7\/d\/600_444647485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Gabo Arora Bio<\/b><br\/>Gabo Arora is a Senior Advisor to the United Nations and award-winning filmmaker with extensive global experience in advocacy projects related to sustainable development, human rights, post-conflict and emergency relief. \u00a0His current focus is on new technologies that promote social causes and make decision-making processes more inclusive.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Jacob has been passionate about food and design for as long as he can remember. Early on he spent a semester abroad in the Czech Republic, where he fell in love with art, architecture, and artisanal beer. As a student and fencing competitor he traveled widely throughout the United States, and became fascinated with regional specialties\u00a0and local spices and ingredients.<\/p> <p>In 2008, Jacob opened Mmmac &amp; Cheese, which soon became a go-to destination for comfort food in Boston\u2019s Quincy Market. Building on his success, he set his sights back on the big apple and in December 2011 realized his dream of bringing food, drink and design to New York City by opening Jacob\u2019s Pickles on the upper west side.<\/p> <p><b>Menu:<a href=\"http:\/\/jacobspickles.com\/food\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/jacobspickles.com\/food\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/jacobspickles.com\/food\/<\/a><\/a><\/b> <b>RSVPs: <\/b><\/p> <p>Please do not RSVP No. You only need to RSVP if you want to come to the event.<\/p> <p>Please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can go.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for.

The fact is, contemporary filmmakers working in Italy are making some of the most impactful, resonant, and awarded movies of this new century. At the heart of many of these films is one studio, Rai Cinema. Celebrating many decades of support for visionary directors, the Rai Cinema catalog is filled with essential titles past and present. This selection of 10 films from the past 15 years gives a strong indication that future generations of cinephiles will look back at this era with nostalgia of their own. Because they are also all recent additions to MoMA\u2019s collection, it is certain that they will be as beautiful to behold then as they are now.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/2\/0\/600_444547200.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Buongiorno, notte (Good Morning, Night) <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>2003.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atwysingleevents\/events\/227279320\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"Speeddating Ages 30-42 --2F\/2M SPOTS LEFT","id":"227279320","time":1450310400000,"updated":1450323011000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1318274900000,"name":"And That's Why You're Single Events - NYC","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":2624342,"urlname":"atwysingleevents","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Broadway at 62nd Street","name":"'wichcraft - David Rubenstein Atrium","lon":-73.982018,"id":5039852,"state":"NY","lat":40.770523,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.48109269142,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1350953027000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join other writers for an hour of focused writing!<\/p> <p>6-7 pm - Show up early, stake out a spot and either socialize or get a jump on writing.<br\/>7:00 - Start.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena. IAC is an educational and research centered organization in the area of consciousness studies, human potential and psychic development, and has offices in over 12 countries worldwide.<\/p> <p>How do I attend?<\/p> <p>Confirm via meetup that you're attending or email us to register at newyork (-at-) iacworld.org<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"59th and Lex subway is closest.

Many people have heard of and used Cucumber, a Ruby tool, to develop acceptance tests in a BDD framework. However, organizations that are mostly Python shops often want a Python tool for acceptance tests. This talk will focus on using the Python selenium bindings in conjunction with the BDD framework Behave. Specifics will include why Behave is a good choice for organizations looking to use BDD to drive automation while sticking with Python.<\/p> <p><b>Presenter:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jess Ingrasselino\u00a0is the Lead Software Engineer in Test at Bitly. She has worked at several startups in lead positions creating automated frameworks to aid her testing process. Jessica employs selenium with BDD frameworks like Cucumber (Ruby) and Behave (Python). Prior to her career in testing, Jessica was a music teacher for ten years.<\/p> <p>Jessica is active in the Python Education community as co-chair of the Pycon Education Summit for the past two years. She founded Teach Code, a non-profit devoted to helping students in underserved communities learn to code. TeachCode is partnering with the NYC DOE this spring to begin the professional development initiative with the curriculum.\u00a0 Jessica teaches a teen code class at Queensborough Community College, and is developing the curriculum to build the program there. Jessica is also writing a book to teach Python to pre-teens and teens, due out with Packt Publishing this spring. She frequently gives talks, about one per month, on technical testing, test strategies, Python test strategies, and other topics.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/226417715\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytqbvb","time":1450310400000,"updated":1450324454000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444407443000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Enterprise-Lean-Startup\/events\/225948776\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Debate","id":"225948776","time":1450310400000,"updated":1450322887000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337211460000,"name":"Lean Startup in the Enterprise Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3880632,"urlname":"Enterprise-Lean-Startup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"LEArNers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"274 36th St Brooklyn.","name":"coinspace","lon":-74.007172,"id":24238375,"state":"NY","lat":40.655949,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.57367897034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449004302000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We're going to drink and talk.

Quite the opposite \u2026 everything can start looking like a problem, and feelings of discouragement and conflict arise naturally. Using Buddha\u2019s insights into the nature of the mind and our reality, and guiding us in peaceful and creative meditations, we will learn that these limited views of our reality are in fact wrong. By learning to let go of this narrow sense of our self and our life, we can learn to connect with the joyful dimension of our being as well as deepening our connections to others\u2019 hearts. This in particular will open us to a new way of seeing our place in the universe. We can learn to step out of our limited misapprehension and into a joyful and naturally solution-oriented enlightened perspective. We will be able to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful life!\u201d And we will be able to bring that wonderful sense of being into the lives as others as well.<\/p> <p>Everyone is welcome.

KLUGING is a term from engineering. A KLUGE is a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem. 99% of people interested in self-improvement are KLUGING together ideas from friends, their beliefs, pop culture, the media, and gurus.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You will understand with TOTAL CLARITY how philosophy and psychology fail or work for you personally. I will show you where does the INSPIRATION GO a WEEK AFTER YOU READ a self-improvement book. We will use examples from some of the most popular book to show you how your Cognitive Structures really work.You may NOT want to miss this event, do you?an introduction to your Brain-mind system as a physical object you can directly influence like a touch screen appliance.<\/p> <p><br\/>HANDS TO DIRECTLY REMOTE CONTROL YOUR MIND:<\/p> <p>1.

ACCESS THE FEELINGS OF POWERFUL MOTIVATION.<\/p> <p>4. HOW TO MAKE YOUR GOALS AND VISIONS REAL.This workshop is different from a discussion group and support group.<\/p> <p>What DO people say about TOUCH SCREEN MIND:<\/p> <p><br\/>It was a great introductory to using your brain\/like a touch screen. The actual experiment done in fact reduced nervousness and anxiety using your fingers pretty amazing. However application and practice is crucial. Interested in more meets up teaching this system.---ArianaI thought there was a lot of great information, and the leader was inspiring. I found at 2 hours in, the leader got a little bit sidetracked, which was distracting to me.----Ali Lebrum\u00a0<\/p> <p>It was a great introductory to using your brain\/like a touch screen. The actual experiment done in fact reduced nervousness and anxiety using your fingers pretty amazing. However application and practice is crucial. Interested in more meets up teaching this system.---Ariana<\/p> <p><br\/>I would give the lecture by itself 5 stars. It was a stimulating conversation and James was open to answering all sorts of curious questions which people had regarding the functioning of the mind. The technology seems to have a helpful effect on most people. I understand that it was an introduction with limited time but I personally wanted to understand more details as to why the system works and why everybody is different in terms of where their signals start and how to use this yourself in a situation where you don't have much time to play around e.g a dealing high priority issue at work while being observed closely by hireups.

You have some problem; you don't know the specific answer, yet you do know that change is part of the answer.<\/p> <p>The world of self-improvement can be SO MUCH MORE THAN INSPIRATION.Would you like to have a NEW LEVEL of Life control through discovering what going on inside your head at a very deep level? There is a STRUCTURE within your Head, Heart and Hands that is unique as your DNA.

KLUGING is a term from engineering. A KLUGE is a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem. 99% of people interested in self-improvement are KLUGING together ideas from friends, their beliefs, pop culture, the media, and gurus.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You will understand with TOTAL CLARITY how philosophy and psychology fail or work for you personally. I will show you where does the INSPIRATION GO a WEEK AFTER YOU READ a self-improvement book. We will use examples from some of the most popular book to show you how your Cognitive Structures really work.You may NOT want to miss this event, do you?an introduction to your Brain-mind system as a physical object you can directly influence like a touch screen appliance.<\/p> <p><br\/>HANDS TO DIRECTLY REMOTE CONTROL YOUR MIND:<\/p> <p>1.

ACCESS THE FEELINGS OF POWERFUL MOTIVATION.<\/p> <p>4. HOW TO MAKE YOUR GOALS AND VISIONS REAL.This workshop is different from a discussion group and support group.<\/p> <p>What DO people say about TOUCH SCREEN MIND:<\/p> <p><br\/>It was a great introductory to using your brain\/like a touch screen. The actual experiment done in fact reduced nervousness and anxiety using your fingers pretty amazing. However application and practice is crucial. Interested in more meets up teaching this system.---ArianaI thought there was a lot of great information, and the leader was inspiring. I found at 2 hours in, the leader got a little bit sidetracked, which was distracting to me.----Ali Lebrum\u00a0<\/p> <p>It was a great introductory to using your brain\/like a touch screen. The actual experiment done in fact reduced nervousness and anxiety using your fingers pretty amazing. However application and practice is crucial. Interested in more meets up teaching this system.---Ariana<\/p> <p><br\/>I would give the lecture by itself 5 stars. It was a stimulating conversation and James was open to answering all sorts of curious questions which people had regarding the functioning of the mind. The technology seems to have a helpful effect on most people. I understand that it was an introduction with limited time but I personally wanted to understand more details as to why the system works and why everybody is different in terms of where their signals start and how to use this yourself in a situation where you don't have much time to play around e.g a dealing high priority issue at work while being observed closely by hireups. Perhaps such methods and the reasoning behind them will probably be taught in the next series of meetups.---Breddy<\/p> <p><br\/>James Murdock was an informative, engaged, and knowledgeable facilitator. Fascinating topic! I look forward to attending the next meeting. -Anna\u00a0<br\/>This Meetup was a real brain opener. I enjoyed learning about the concepts offered by the organizer.

The northern peak is 1531ft and has a series of radio antennas on its summit. The higher southern peak is 1610ft and has a lookout tower on its summit.

Here, the players' experiences take center stage, even informing a sound design that mixes noises from the match with music from Puccini, Wagner, Heitor Villa-Lobos, along with an original score composed by Jorge Amorim. As such, Sunday Ball is the very antithesis of a straightforward sports documentary.<\/p> <p><br\/>As a great number of open fields previously used for soccer practice have been bought by real estate investors, it becomes clear that Mr. Rocha\u2019s cinema is also an expression of an endangered Brazilian form of bonding and sociality \u2013 giving the film an extra layer of significance.<\/p> <p><br\/>TRAILER:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/8as15wmcdacby6m\/SundayBall_Trailer.mov?dl=0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/8as15wmcdacby6m\/SundayBall_Trailer.mov?dl=0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/8as15wmcdacby6m\/SundayBall_Trailer.mov?dl=0<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Directed by Eryk Rocha, 2014.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/226936679\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Each Thurs. from 7-9pm  Happiness and Goodness at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"krgdllytqbwb","time":1450396800000,"updated":1450406467000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07522","country":"us","city":"Paterson","phone":"(973)595-8582","address_1":"351 West Broadway","name":"Brownstone","lon":-74.18587,"id":1418648,"state":"NJ","lat":40.926949,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":90,"headcount":0,"distance":15.979341507,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1447697662000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are having our Holiday Dinner Dance at the beautiful Brownstone in Paterson this year, instead of in my home. 4 singles groups will be attending.\u00a0 I hope you will join us for a most elegant event, celebrating Hanukkah, Christmas and the other December holidays !!<\/p> <p>The Brownstone will present an all-you-can-eat, sit-down dinner served family style with a variety of entrees and salads and dessert.\u00a0 To complement this delicious meal will be an assortment of beverages, including wine, soda, water and coffee.\u00a0 Our favorite DJ Dino will spin an assortment of dance and holiday songs, something for everyone's preferences.\u00a0 <i><b>Tickets are $ 45. per person and must be purchased in advance.\u00a0 There will be no tickets sold at the door for this event !!\u00a0<\/b><\/i> Free valet parking is available, as well as a cash bar for those who prefer mixed drinks.<\/p> <p>Our Holiday Party sells out every year, and this year we are limited to 90 people.\u00a0 Tickets will be sold on a \"first paid, first served basis\".\u00a0 So, make your paid reservations quickly, as we had to return checks to 15 people last year !<\/p> <p>Send your checks, payable to Jerry D., for $ 45. per person <i><b>no later than Friday, November 27th\u00a0<\/b><\/i> to :\u00a0 Jerry\u00a0 D.\u00a0 PO Box\u00a0 443\u00a0 Midland Park, NJ\u00a0 07432<\/p> <p>I hope you can join us for a festive, elegant evening as we continue to celebrate the holiday season !!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rockland-Bergen-Orange-Westchester-Singles-45-to-65\/events\/226816210\/","yes_rsvp_count":90,"duration":14400000,"name":"SOLD  OUT  -  No tickets sold at the door - Elegant  Holiday  Dinner  Dance","id":"226816210","time":1450396800000,"updated":1450554264000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280441833000,"name":"Rockland - Bergen - Orange - Westchester Singles  45 to 65","group_lon":-74.1399993896,"id":1682918,"urlname":"Rockland-Bergen-Orange-Westchester-Singles-45-to-65","group_lat":41,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"446 Rogers Avenue","name":"PELS Pie Co.","lon":-73.953941,"id":24160645,"state":"NY","lat":40.661652,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":6,"distance":6.40279531479,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447990159000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We're switching to SF after two months at the fantasy end of the pool with Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie.

And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together\u00a0sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=224+West+4th+street%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10014%2C+us","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/227363670\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":9000000,"name":"3D
