This month's Brooklyn Permaculture Meetup features recent PDC graduate Chlo\u00e9 Rossetti impressively showing how permaculture can be applied to our social and urban landscape. Join us!<\/p> <p><br\/>In this presentation, I propose a wellness collective and business that retrofits the life of its clients and members to align them with the principles of permaculture. I imagine a zone system of wellness care, beginning with Zone 0 (the self), extending outward to our inputs, environment, nonhuman allies, human allies, and strangers, reworking our relationships at every stage to encourage regeneration, abundance, and healing. I also propose a test site for the business that is a multi-person brownstone in upper Manhattan, packed with permacultural initiatives, holistic health workshops, and community programming.Finally, I imagine a financial structure for the company that redistributes resources to the margin, and also monetizes and financially values care labor, in the spirit of Wages for Housework, as a way to subvert capitalism while functioning inside of it. It is my hope that we can learn to live regeneratively in urban environments.<\/p> <p><br\/>Chlo\u00e9 Rossetti is a writer, artist, and budding permaculturist based in New York.

This month's Brooklyn Permaculture Meetup features recent PDC graduate Chlo\u00e9 Rossetti impressively showing how permaculture can be applied to our social and urban landscape. Join us!<\/p> <p>In this presentation, I propose a wellness collective and business that retrofits the life of its clients and members to align them with the principles of permaculture. I imagine a zone system of wellness care, beginning with Zone 0 (the self), extending outward to our inputs, environment, nonhuman allies, human allies, and strangers, reworking our relationships at every stage to encourage regeneration, abundance, and healing. I also propose a test site for the business that is a multi-person brownstone in upper Manhattan, packed with permacultural initiatives, holistic health workshops, and community programming.Finally, I imagine a financial structure for the company that redistributes resources to the margin, and also monetizes and financially values care labor, in the spirit of Wages for Housework, as a way to subvert capitalism while functioning inside of it. It is my hope that we can learn to live regeneratively in urban environments.<\/p> <p><br\/>Chlo\u00e9 Rossetti is a writer, artist, and budding permaculturist based in New York. Her practice in energy healing and somatics has recently led her to contemplate reparative systems that extend beyond the human body into socio-ecological realms. Chlo\u00e9 is currently focusing on a scalable wellness modality and test site that integrates personal healing with environmental regeneration and bioremediation. Chlo\u00e9 is a fall 2015 graduate of Center for Bioregional Living's permaculture design course &lt;a&gt;www.permaculturenewyork.com.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nycpermaculture\/events\/227442240\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"From Consumption to Regeneration: Permaculture to Retrofit the Urban Lifeway","id":"227442240","time":1450483200000,"updated":1450491509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1155827483000,"name":"The New York Permaculture Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":306773,"urlname":"nycpermaculture","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Permie enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Wayne","address_1":"95 Mountan View Blvd.","name":"Mother's Ale House & Grill","lon":-74.26503,"id":23892360,"state":"NJ","lat":40.914562,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.3678131104,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448912196000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Definitely used happy twice!

The threats of nuclear war, catastrophic climate change and a merciless chain of terrorism can be summarized as peace or perish. Most people have a one-dimensional mind, and their response to the violence is often another outburst of violence, leading to an endless state of warfare. While religious people may think in terms of the last days or Armageddon, secular people see the decline of civilization. What is the humanist response to this predicament and what are the chances of success?

Is spirituality part of your everyday life? How do you find it? Each monthly conversation will focus on a specific topic or question to guide the conversation.<\/p> <p><b>Upcoming topic: \u00a0\u00a0<\/b><b> Is Life a Random Walk?\u00a0<br\/><\/b>Do you ever wonder what the purpose of life is, is there more to life than meets the eye, if your experiences have meaning, and even if life matters at all? There are so many questions\u2014all good ones\u2014about who you are and where are you going. On the surface, life can certainly seem unfair at times. Are our challenges random?\u00a0 Or, are they part of a much larger scheme of things where life is perfectly balanced? Perhaps we can discover ways to more easily navigate life and be compassionate and loving even when times are tough. Hear what this means to others and express what you\u2019ve been thinking about questions and ideas like these in regard to your own life..<\/p> <p><b>Please join us for this open discussion format<\/b>\u2014come to explore ideas, share your experiences, ask questions, or hear from others. Our goal is to learn from and honor each other\u2019s spiritual insights in a relaxed and comfortable environment. We look forward to meeting you for the first time or seeing you again.

From parking head south along the cliff and catch the aqua blazed Long Path (LP). Shortly after reaching the LP turn left on the blue\/white blazed Forest Trail and descend steep terrain on a series of switchbacks and stairs. At end of trail, turn left on the white blazed Shore Trail. The trail soon reaches a difficult, rocky area known as Giant Stairs. Be careful here as some rocks are not stable. After about a mile of rocks, you reach flat ground and pass Peanut Leap Falls (impressive after a rain, a trickle otherwise) and some ruins. Trail climbs here and reaches the LP again. For a more strenuous, scenic route, turn left on LP, cross bridge, climb steep section and return to parking. For an easier return, continue straight on LP to a distinct, unmarked trail that leaves to left (sign says To Park Office). Take this.

The narrator is a born and raised scam artist who sees a chance to leave light sex work behind for a career in what she does best, reading people and telling them what they want to hear. Susan seems like the perfect mark--rich, desperate, and terrified of the evil she says lives in her house. But things are not what they seem, especially with Flynn at the helm. A short story written for George R.R. Martin\u2019s Rogues anthology, The Grownup is a tightly wrought psychological thrill ride that will leave readers replaying every well spent moment.''<\/p> <p>I look forward to seeing you all for a fun brunch and book discussion! :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s\/events\/226846047\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"December Book Club Brunch ","id":"226846047","time":1450537200000,"updated":1450569188000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1400015507000,"name":"Girl Friends near Millburn\/Cranford NJ (late 20's - 30's)","group_lon":-74.3000030518,"id":14438052,"urlname":"Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07097","country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"Montgomery Street (between John F.

McDarrah decided to bring the people not to the gallery, but to the scenes that made the show such a success: the Greenwich Village locales documented by McDarrah during his 50-year tenure at the\u00a0Village Voice\u00a0\u2013 such as Washington Square Park; the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the modern day gay rights movement; and the various stomping grounds of the individuals he photographed that helped shape the 1960s ethos, including Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol and Jimi Hendrix.<\/p> <p>Each walker gets a\u00a0FREE keepsake multi-postcard set of classic McDarrah images\u00a0and the tours go to the same locations\u00a0to see how they have changed,\u00a0 how they are the same, and to hear the stories behind the famous photos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Click below to buy tickets and enter Promo Code\u00a0<b>MCDTOUR<\/b>\u00a0for 50% off!!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.savethevillagetours.com\/tours\/#tours-list\">\u00a0<b>***CLICK HERE TO BOOK TOUR **<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/1\/8\/600_444888920.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0Photo \u00a9 2015 Estate of Fred W.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

There's lot's of technical expertise, lurkers, newbies, and interested friends just hanging out, so even if you don't race, you can still fly, take videos, or just watch and learn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Meetup Location:<\/b> Exact Address TBD<\/p> <p><br\/>Look at google maps here for the exact location:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/3fzoojyz28D2\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/nxd8wESfFkk\"&gt;<a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/nxd8wESfFkk\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/nxd8wESfFkk<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nBrowse google maps ahead of time so you\u2019re familiar with how to find us\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please check in at the line of canopies at the end of the parking area and ask for Frank.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Suggested equipment to bring:<\/b><br\/>Your aircraft(s), props and batteries, repair equipment<br\/>Something to sit on \u2013 this is an open field.<br\/>Something to sit under like a small (or large) canopy. Team members do bring canopies to manage their equipment and make repairs. We ask that everyone respects the space they need to operate comfortable.<br\/>AMA License: If you plan on flying, you can get it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>).<br\/>Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses (for young pilots under 13 it is HIGHLY recommended)<br\/>Sunscreen and water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING<\/b>:<br\/><b>NO FLY ZONE<\/b>: For safety, the no fly zone is \"IN, ABOVE AND BEHIND\" the line formed by the pilot pit area. You may not operate your quad behind or to the right of the last canopy. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there are lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control or not.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FLY ZONE<\/b>: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone . Please pilot your aircraft from within the pit area (aka the no-fly-zone). If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intentions so other pilots can avoid you. During free flight\/ practice. you may enter the field by announcing \u201cON THE FIELD\u201d loudly to entire pit area.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>CRASH &amp; TRASH<\/b>: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless and keep the park rangers happy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>KIDS<\/b>: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>\"ZERO HARM\" RESPONSIBLE FLYING:<\/b> Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious oriented and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. IOW, if you are about to have a collision, especially with a dog, bird, human, or any living thing, think \"zero harm\" first and do everything you can to avoid the collision and immediately divert your flight path even if it means at the expense of your own rig. Living things are a lot harder to repair than metal and electronics and typically don't require litigation to fix. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>RACING<\/b>: Know your skill limits and pilot your quad accordingly. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx channel \"X\" , or the most critical, \"WHOMEVER JUST POWERED UP, PLEASE POWER DOWN IMMEDIATELY!\" and so on. It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. But beyond this, most importantly, have a blast of fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT <\/b><br\/>Since most pilots are using the 5.8ghz video transmitter bands for FPV video, so please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark\/Immersion or Boscam) and frequency channel. Every pilot uses this technology to fly their aircraft safely, so it is imperative that every pilot understands and operates using safe video transmission practices.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>THE BASICS: <\/b><br\/>1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. LOOK THROUGH YOU GOGGLES FIRST. Someone may accidentally be on the channel you were assigned. Listen intently when you do (even if you have a frequency tag), and if you hear a pilot exclaim that they've lost signal, power down immediately. Flying blind is a dangerous situation and is to be avoided at all costs.<br\/>2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles\/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping.<br\/>3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video .<br\/>4) For racing, the racing coordinator(s) will make frequency assignments and assign spotters.<br\/>5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Looking forward to seeing you there!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"See details in description below","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Team-S3-FPV-Multirotor-Racing\/events\/227472296\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"S3 FPV racing -  Open Session - Gates, flags and fun !

Failed love, tormented criminals, abusive childhoods? Fortunately, the annual Thurber Prize was established in 1997 to honor outstanding examples of American humor. This award is named for James Thurber who died in 1961 and who was one of the most admired and controversial humorists of the first half of the 20th century.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>The 13 Clocks<\/i> is a fantasy fairytale written in a unique cadenced style, in which a mysterious prince must complete a seemingly impossible task to free a maiden from the clutches of an evil duke. The story is noted for Thurber's constant, complex wordplay, and his use of an almost continuous internal meter, with occasional hidden rhymes \u2014 akin to blank verse, but with no line breaks to advertise the structure. Other fantasy books by Thurber, such as <i>The Wonderful O<\/i>, also contained hints of this unusual prose form.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Not convinced? Just check out the opening paragraph:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\"Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn\u2019t go, there lived a cold, aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda. She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile, and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep, and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts, or to tear the wings from nightingales.\"<\/i><\/p> <p>And at only 130 pages, this fairytale seems like a perfect light-hearted romp of a read for the holidays.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/225169177\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"James Thurber's The 13 Clocks","id":"225169177","time":1450548000000,"updated":1450557592000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":21.271402359,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449470200000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/0\/0\/600_444856640.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/QueensLIUrbanSocialNetworkingGroup\/events\/227264298\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Glory Temple Ministries Christmas Buffet Service","id":"227264298","time":1450548000000,"updated":1450560609000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1177801845000,"name":"The Queens Long Island Urban Social Networking Group","group_lon":-73.5899963379,"id":488137,"urlname":"QueensLIUrbanSocialNetworkingGroup","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Social Networkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":11,"headcount":10,"distance":3.47414016724,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":15,"created":1448768157000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for an intimate sit down between EWNYC members of the group in Harlem's famous Maison.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Following her recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, these interactive exhibitions are comprised of two entirely new, full gallery installations.THE RIVERBED\u00a0will open to the public on December 11, 2015 and continue through January 23, 2016 at Andrea Rosen Gallery and January 29, 2016 at Galerie Lelong. The artist will be present at the openings.<\/p> <p>Since the early 1960s, audience participation has been a crucial aspect of Ono\u2019s work. To make a village is a political gesture, as well as a formal one. Audience participation is key to completing\u00a0THE RIVERBED\u00a0through everyday action coupled with contemplation; they are collaborators with the artist, similar to the collaboration between the artist and the two galleries. Additionally, it is significant to Ono that all three \u201cprincipals\u201d\u2014 the artist and two gallery leaders\u2014are female; the support and participation of women in power is one of Ono\u2019s longstanding concerns. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Conceived as two room-sized installations shown in two spaces\u2014a whole in two parts\u2014visitors are encouraged, via instructions, to visit both spaces in order to experience and fully understand\u00a0THE RIVERBED. Both galleries will have a pile of large river stones that Ono has selected and gathered. She will inscribe words like remember, dream, and wish on the stones, which have been honed and shaped by water over time. Visitors may pick up stones and hold it in their laps, concentrating on the word and letting go of their anger or fear, transforming the stone into an emotional object to be placed upon the pile of stones in the center of the room. Additional instructions on paper will encourage you to \u201cdraw a line to take me to the farthest place in our planet.\u201d Like the\u00a0Wish Tree,\u00a0THE RIVERBED\u00a0becomes a repository of hopes and dreams for individuals and the world. Uniting two separate physical spaces and environments, Ono will create a temporary, but real, village that brings Hikari (light in Japanese) to each space and viewer.\u00a0 Another aspect is to see the difference between the installations at both spaces.\u00a0 Though ostensibly the same, they will each evolve differently over time, in part because of how the viewer interacts with the materials.\u00a0 These differences will be recorded, providing an opportunity to see that Ono's works are not only about audience participation, but how the effect has a significance within the work.<\/p> <p>Mend Piece, an installation that has been shown in a number of Ono\u2019s retrospectives, will reinforce the idea of healing and will be shown in the smaller rooms at both galleries. Fragments of broken cups are placed on a table for the audience to mend with tape, string, glue or other materials and then placed on shelves around the all white room, reminiscent of a dream. The metaphor of mending and healing are close. In Ono\u2019s words: \u201dAs you mend the cup, mending that is needed elsewhere in the Universe gets done as well. Be aware of it as you mend.\u201d Following their mending, the participants may have an actual cup of coffee, forming another kind of temporary village.<\/p> <p>3. JAMES COHAN GALLERY (533 W 26th) presents: BILL VIOLA, 'INVERTED BIRTH'<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/9\/0\/600_445211408.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Regarded as a seminal figure in the development of video art, Viola has been celebrated throughout his 40-year career for combining state-of-the-art technology with universal humanistic themes \u2013 birth, death, and the unfolding of consciousness. These themes continue in Viola\u2019s\u00a0Inverted Birth, which explores the life cycle as a continuum rather than a linear progression. Viola has remarked, \u201cBirth is not a beginning, death is not an end.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the main gallery, Viola\u2019s monumental video and audio installation\u00a0Inverted Birth\u00a0is projected onto a fifteen-foot high screen anchored to the floor. The work depicts five stages of awakening through a series of violent transformations. the heat of summer.\u00a0 Each work is shown on a vertical LCD screen, and installed one on each of the four walls, creating an immersive environment in the gallery\u2019s last room. \u00a0Four figures are silently and gradually overcome by the four elements of nature. As Viola describes: \u201cFlames rain down, winds begin to lash, water cascades, and earth flies up. As the elements rage, each martyr\u2019s resolve remains unchanged. In their most violent assault, the elements represent the darkest hour of the martyr\u2019s passage through death into the light.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. PAUL KASMIN GALLERY [masked]th Ave) presents: ERIK PARKER, 'UNDERTOW'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/9\/2\/600_445216018.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>His iconic, highly-saturated palette and intricate compositions are amplified by collage and airbrush techniques that create a balance of density and open space.<\/p> <p><br\/>Undertow\u00a0marks the artist\u2019s third solo-exhibition with the gallery and offers insight into the evolution of Parker\u2019s work over the last two decades. Here, Parker continues to critically chart\u00a0the world\u2019s current political, social, and economic landscapes with compositions brimming with references to media, popular culture, music, and art history. Synthesizing multiple elements from his myriad styles into new dynamic compositions, the artist works at breaking down the metanarratives of late modernist painting while simultaneously digesting the pictorial chatter of scrolling feeds of social media.<\/p> <p><br\/>Highlighted in the exhibition are Parker\u2019s new shaped canvases with which he develops the narrative possibilities of form. In\u00a0Offshore, 2015 the support structure of the canvas takes the shape of binocular lenses, framing the action as if seen from afar. Parker\u2019s large-scale, two-part shaped canvas titled\u00a0Disconnected, 2015, features a pyramid representing the global elite. It is physically separated from the second canvas \u2013 literally leaving the rest of the picture, or perhaps, society behind.<\/p> <p>5. PAUL KASMIN GALLERY [masked]th Ave) presents: MARK RYDEN, 'DODECAHEDRON'<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/2\/c\/600_445215916.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The vocabulary of images in Ryden\u2019s new body of work remains consistent with his pervasive distortion of scale and his iconic fairytale-like creatures set against seductive landscapes of untouched beauty. However, the subject of his latest series is informed by the geometric structure \u201cdodecahedron,\u201d a solid figure bearing twelve sides whose perfect symmetry has been the source of extensive query by mathematicians and scientists since antiquity. Drawing upon the form\u2019s mystery and divine connotations as a source of inspiration, Ryden explores the bridge between the physical world and the intangible realm.<\/p> <p><br\/>For the exhibition, Ryden created his first sculpture cast from bronze. Measuring one meter in height, the work consists of twelve pentagonal panels that join together to form a dodecahedron. Each panel is individually cast and\u00a0features images and motifs that have been prevalent throughout the artist\u2019s oeuvre such as; the tree, the eye, the fetus, the bee, the ammonite, and Abraham Lincoln.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ryden\u2019s labor-intensive canvases skillfully rework centuries of art history, combining the grandeur of Spanish and Italian religious painting with the decorative richness of Old Master compositions and the lush textures of French Neo-Classicism. Expanding on these concepts, the artist\u2019s paintings focus on \u201cthe soul confronting its physical form\u201d as represented by his reoccurring feminine child figure, he calls \u201canima\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d figure. These anima figures appear under different guises, such as in Anatomia, 2015 and Aurora, 2015. For the artist, they represent the part of us that wonders at the elegant mathematics that exists underneath everything and the sacred geometry that constructs our physical world.<\/p> <p><br\/>6. PACE GALLERY (510 W 25th St) present: ILYA &amp; EMILIA KABAKOV, 'NEW PAINTINGS'<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/8\/c\/600_445211404.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>7. YOSSI MILO GALLERY [masked]th Ave) \u00a0presents: GROUP SHOW, 'I AM A LIE AND I AM GOLD'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/5\/600_445211493.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>an exhibition about photography without the inclusion of a single photograph. Curated by artist Marco Breuer, the exhibition features drawings, paintings, sculptures, textiles, and installations by 25 artists who engage with a wide range of photographic issues. This exhibition is based on the idea that photography is a principle, not a product.<\/p> <p><br\/>The ubiquity of photography has a considerable equalizing effect. Everything eventually ends up as a photograph\u2014every experience, every piece of matter is sooner or later translated into a photograph, and then of course shared, and used as a measuring stick for all future experiences. Photography is at once the most public and the most private of mediums. It is an ever-shifting practice that manifests in many hybrid forms.<\/p> <p>Photography in all its manifestations has had an enormous influence on other art forms. Artists from Monet to Gerhard Richter have not only based their works on photographic images, they have often borrowed the very concept of photography itself. Many artists have a complicated relationship to the medium, at times working less\u00a0with\u00a0and more\u00a0against\u00a0photography. David Hockney once said: \u201cPhotography is all right if you don\u2019t mind looking at the world from the point of view of a paralyzed Cyclops, for a split second.\u201d<\/p> <p>8. ANDREA ROSEN GALLERY (525 W 24th St) presents: YOKO ONO, 'RIVERBED PT II'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/6\/a\/600_445211626.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Yoko Ono\u2014a forerunner in Conceptual art involving collaboration, audience participation and social activism\u2014will present a double exhibition,\u00a0THE RIVERBED, at Galerie Lelong and Andrea Rosen Gallery. Following her recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, these interactive exhibitions are comprised of two entirely new, full gallery installations.THE RIVERBED\u00a0will open to the public on December 11, 2015 and continue through January 23, 2016 at Andrea Rosen Gallery and January 29, 2016 at Galerie Lelong. The artist will be present at the openings.<\/p> <p><br\/>Since the early 1960s, audience participation has been a crucial aspect of Ono\u2019s work. To make a village is a political gesture, as well as a formal one. Audience participation is key to completing\u00a0THE RIVERBED\u00a0through everyday action coupled with contemplation; they are collaborators with the artist, similar to the collaboration between the artist and the two galleries. Additionally, it is significant to Ono that all three \u201cprincipals\u201d\u2014 the artist and two gallery leaders\u2014are female; the support and participation of women in power is one of Ono\u2019s longstanding concerns. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Conceived as two room-sized installations shown in two spaces\u2014a whole in two parts\u2014visitors are encouraged, via instructions, to visit both spaces in order to experience and fully understand\u00a0THE RIVERBED. Both galleries will have a pile of large river stones that Ono has selected and gathered. She will inscribe words like remember, dream, and wish on the stones, which have been honed and shaped by water over time. Visitors may pick up stones and hold it in their laps, concentrating on the word and letting go of their anger or fear, transforming the stone into an emotional object to be placed upon the pile of stones in the center of the room. Additional instructions on paper will encourage you to \u201cdraw a line to take me to the farthest place in our planet.\u201d Like the\u00a0Wish Tree,\u00a0THE RIVERBED\u00a0becomes a repository of hopes and dreams for individuals and the world. Uniting two separate physical spaces and environments, Ono will create a temporary, but real, village that brings Hikari (light in Japanese) to each space and viewer.\u00a0 Another aspect is to see the difference between the installations at both spaces.\u00a0 Though ostensibly the same, they will each evolve differently over time, in part because of how the viewer interacts with the materials.\u00a0 These differences will be recorded, providing an opportunity to see that Ono's works are not only about audience participation, but how the effect has a significance within the work.<\/p> <p>Mend Piece, an installation that has been shown in a number of Ono\u2019s retrospectives, will reinforce the idea of healing and will be shown in the smaller rooms at both galleries. Fragments of broken cups are placed on a table for the audience to mend with tape, string, glue or other materials and then placed on shelves around the all white room, reminiscent of a dream. The metaphor of mending and healing are close. In Ono\u2019s words: \u201dAs you mend the cup, mending that is needed elsewhere in the Universe gets done as well. Be aware of it as you mend.\u201d Following their mending, the participants may have an actual cup of coffee, forming another kind of temporary village.<\/p> <p>9. MIKE WEISS GALLERY (520 W 24th St) presents: STEFANIE GUTHIEL, 'THE HOSUE OF MR. PEEPS'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/f\/4\/600_445214068.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>the Berlin-based artist has delved deep into the recesses of her imagination \u2013 back where horned beasts, laser beams, onesies, a brass marching band, phonographs, multi-talented chickens, the original stooge named Krampus and a giant pink elephant all reside \u2013 and emerged with a phantasmagoric stable of characters \u00e0 la a secularized and hallucinatory version of Noah\u2019s Arc. With this herd of misfit creatures, Gutheil has left normality at the door and transformed the gallery into a sanctuary of the bizarre \u2013 a surreal, utopic landscape of chromatic and psychological vibrancy.<\/p> <p>With all their quirks and foibles in plain sight, the artist\u2019s fantastical creatures appear to us as friends and intimates. In fact, it is precisely because of the alluring, almost childlike honesty inherent in the figures unabashed eccentricities that connection with the works is nearly inevitable. Yet there is more to these characters than their carnivalesque appearance; in each, Gutheil has instilled an emotional gravity that seems both personally derived and universally comprehensible. Sometimes the sentiment is uplifting \u2013 for example in\u00a0A Walk in the Forest, where we find two cronies strutting with emoticon-worthy smiles strewn across their faces.\u00a0 Other times, the mood isn\u2019t always so chummy.\u00a0 In\u00a0Safe Bet, it is impossible to say with certainty whether the winged yet dense-looking humanoid is falling down or flying upward, if it has walked the plank by force or leapt from the diving board by choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In their peculiar features and with their hearts on their sleeves, Gutheil\u2019s oddballs all emit a vaguely familiar sense of the folkloric, as if the artist unraveled them from traditional fables and stitched together her own.\u00a0<\/p> <p>10. HOERLE-GUGGENHEIM (527 W 23rd St) presents: DAVID WELKER, 'SUBCONSCIOUS NARRATIVES'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/7\/8\/600_445214456.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Welker has followed a path of experimentation and genre jumping taking him from the top of the landscape mural scene to the top of the concert poster scene in just a few years. Welker is now setting his sights on the gallery world as he continues to express all of his varied influences in a unified visual aesthetic which combines his deep appreciation of early 20th century Surrealism with his love of pervasive pop culture.<\/p> <p>With\u00a0Subconscious Narratives\u00a0Welker depicts a thought before it becomes a word, concept, story or tangible form. These studies are not isolated to one brief instant but instead capture the turmoil of forms transitioning in the mind from moment to moment. By getting in tune with his minds eye Welker has noticed that the periphery of each thought has edges fading into others. His imagination hovers in a space devoid of temporal constraints or physical permanence. This is the conceptual DNA of\u00a0Subconscious Narratives\u00a0- an exploration of the cloudy impressions leading up to and receding from a fabricated instance. While the center of the pieces may be a conceptual focus, the edges form building blocks for dreams not yet depicted. The subconscious narrative barely holds onto the present while the past and future drive into being. Its beginning is another\u2019s middle and end.<\/p> <p>11. ANDREW KREPS GALLERY (537 W 22nd St) presents: WALKS AND DICPLACEMENTS, GROUP SHOW<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/d\/d\/600_445215069.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>an exhibition that brings together eleven artists whose work reflects an engagement with pre-existing source materials. Working in disparate media, they share a lyrical approach that works to abstract the original while maintaining its integrity, creating new aesthetic and emotive experiences with objects, images, bodies, videos and sounds. What emerges across these investigations are shared sensibilities, as well as overlapping strategies of erosion, stratification, embedding, and association. This allows the exhibition to unfold similarly to the works themselves \u2013 a walk from one place to another, that bears with it the accumulative traces of both decisions made, and what one carries with them.<\/p> <p>12. DANESE COREY GALLERY (511 W 22nd St) presents: DORON LANGBERG and GABY-COLLINS FERNANDEZ, group show<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/d\/7\/2\/600_445215730.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Doron Langberg and Gaby Collins-Fernandez. As students at Yale University, they became friends; as artists, they share studio space and enjoy a continuing dialogue about painting and the very nature of art.<\/p> <p><br\/>Langberg has said, \u201cusing a sexual image can be a powerful vehicle\u201d to demonstrate a broad range of emotions \u2013 desire and loss, vulnerability and tenderness. While his paintings are formed by deeply felt personal experience, they transcend their homoerotic content and embrace the universal human condition. He views the figurative tradition through a prism that references art history \u2013 Ingres, Bonnard, Manet, Whistler, Homer.<\/p> <p>Collins-Fernandez employs seductive materials in her intimately scaled works, animating the surfaces with thick applications of pigment and strips and swags of velvet \u2013 its textural delights and associations with garments, curtains, and costume. Snippets of New York street conversation, captured fragments of a highly energetic and diverse urban culture, are embedded within the dense topography of her paintings.<\/p> <p>13. DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (537 W 20th St) presents: GIORGIO MORANDI, WORKS FROM 1940'S-1960'S<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/d\/0\/600_445215312.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>David Zwirner is pleased to present an exhibition of paintings from the 1940s to the 1960s by the celebrated Italian artist Giorgio Morandi (1890- 1964) on view at our 537 West 20th Street location in New York. The first major exhibition of Morandi\u2019s later work in America since the acclaimed 2008 retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the show will focus primarily on the period during which he developed and refined his investigations of serial, reductive, and permutational forms and compositions\u2014aspects that had a profound influence on twentieth-century and contemporary art and painting. The exhibition will include important loans from institutions such as the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., as well as from numerous significant private collections.<\/p> <p>14. JACK SHAINMAN GALLERY (513 W 20th St) presents \u00a0TOYIN OJIH ODUTOLAOF, 'CONTEXT AND WITHOUT'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/3\/4\/600_445215412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ojih Odutola incorporates chalk, ink, pen, and marker into textured portraits addressing the interplay between line and form, as well as context and perception. The subjects in the exhibition have been pulled from the vastness of everyday imagery, but Ojih Odutola transforms them into studies of mark-making and material, the results denying placement in any stable setting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n15. DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (519 W 19th St) presents: JAMES WELLING, 'CHOREOGRAPH'<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/c\/8\/600_445215560.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Choreograph\u00a0<\/i>debuts a series of digital photographs of dance, with elements of architecture and\/or landscape. These were made by placing three different black-and-white photographs into Adobe Photoshop\u2019s red, green, and blue color channels, thus yielding a multilayered color image similar to double exposures in analog photography. The artist then alters it using Photoshop tools (hue\/saturation and selective color), and as adjustments are made, various parts of the image come forward or recede.<\/p> <p><br\/>Welling\u2019s interest in dance dates back to 1970 when he saw the Merce Cunningham Dance Company perform while at university in Pittsburgh. He took dance classes at the time, but after transferring to the California Institute of the Arts, he turned to photography as his medium. This exhibition marks his return to dance, albeit in photographic form.<\/p> <p>FEE: $5.00 for regular members; FREE for full-paid members!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GuySocialNyc\/events\/227009054\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":14400000,"name":"GUY GALLERY WALK: DECEMBER EDITION","id":"227009054","time":1450551600000,"updated":1450572852000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383018152000,"name":"GUY SOCIAL NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10885132,"urlname":"GuySocialNyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"GUYS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"9 West 124th St","name":"New York Public Library, 3rd Floor Community Room","lon":-73.943275,"id":24224115,"state":"NY","lat":40.806213,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.59861850739,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449251469000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come, spread out, fellowship and craft for a few hours - should be good pre-holiday fun! \u00a0:-)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Come to the 3rd floor!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Harlem-Scrapbooking-Meetup\/events\/227211889\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":9900000,"name":"NYPL Craft Meetup - 124th Street Branch (3rd floor)","id":"227211889","time":1450551600000,"updated":1450563180000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442282544000,"name":"Harlem Scrapbooking Meetup","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":18932678,"urlname":"Harlem-Scrapbooking-Meetup","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Creative Crafties"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":4.34205007553,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448043912000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Reiki Level I certification\u00a0program teaches you Reiki Principles, what is Reiki, how Reiki heals, history of Reiki, Reiki symbols, symptoms of feeling Reiki, determining dominant hand- exercise, starting and ending a Reiki session, Reiki self healing hand positions, Gassho meditation, meaning of the 7 major chakras, Chakra exercise, Reiki hand positions for chakras and self.

The top entrance in the picture is on 53rd St between Lexington avenue and 3rd avenue. The bottom entrance is on the corner of 53rd St and Lexington avenue. The building is called the Citigroup Center but the area where we sit is also called the Atrium Shops and Cafes. Which is located on the bottom floor: a big open area which has many round and square tables and chairs. The ZIP CODE is 10022. If you still have problems finding us look for a high rise glass building. Barnes and Nobles and 24 Hr Fitness are also located in the same building except on the upper level. If you enter on the upper levels then take the escalator down to ground floor where all the people and tables are.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/d\/0\/600_167973232.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Practice\/events\/227356658\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"English Study and Practice for Non-Native Speakers","id":"xlptmlyvcbmb","time":1450553400000,"updated":1450561910000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1309223498000,"name":"Chinese, Japanese and Korean in Practice (Non-beginners)","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":2089721,"urlname":"Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Practice","group_lat":40.75,"who":"CJK Experts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10005","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"60 Wall street","name":"Artrium of 60 Wall street.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Whether the holiday lights or decorations, the beginning of winter, the ending of another year or the love in the air and the joy in our hearts. Indeed December is a special month to all of us. Once again, Arlene and I are opening our home to our members to a wonderful evening. We will be serving, cheese &amp; crackers with wine\/soda, playing yahtzee and coffee\/tea\/dessert after the game. We will play yahtzee as couples and if you never played, don't worry, it won't take you 3 minutes to learn. We will be playing a quicker version, using one card per couple and variation rules. Once again we will be giving out an award\u00a0to the winning couple. If there are couples who want to pass on the game and just enjoy the fun, you are more then welcome to come.\u00a0A great night for laughs and a good way to get to know our members. We will tried to fit in as many couples as possible.\u00a0What could you bring? Nothing is necessary, just bring your fun and holiday spirit. My house is very easy to get to by train (Ave N-(F) around the corner)\u00a0and parking in the area should not be difficult. I do have a 90' driveway if you want to park there. I also have a private room in the back of my property, for anyone who wants to take a break or a smoke. This is our 6th year we have done this and indeed it is very popular. We will tried to allow more couples then last year but my home can only hold so many.We will however will be taking a waiting list and I will asked for confirmations several weeks before the event. Athough the time is for 5:00, if you get there an hour or two later is not a problem.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/cherish\/events\/225724272\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"An Evening of Good Times, Yahtzee & Dessert 6.","id":"225724272","time":1450562400000,"updated":1450604058000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286625067000,"name":"Cherish - the group for couples","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1719321,"urlname":"cherish","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Couples"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"189 Brunswick Street","name":"Art of Living","lon":0,"id":23887255,"state":"NJ","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":3.43878388405,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441382493000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>How to be unconditionally happy?<\/b><\/p> <p>A mind that is calm, without anticipation and agitation is the birth right of all individuals.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

A two-hour event of storytelling and music, as we tell the story of humanity, and how we have faced the darkness together over the ages. Experience an emerging mythology told in today's language and understanding.<\/p> <p>Raymond describes the event:<\/p> <p>\"Long ago, winter was a challenging time. The world grew dark and cold. Plants withered and game became scarce. It was a mysterious problem.<\/p> <p>People celebrated in the face of that adversity. Partly to raise their spirits and carry forward as a community, and partly as a way to try to affect the world around them. Their best understanding - their mythology - was that divine forces controlled the world. Perhaps those forces could be bartered or reasoned with.<\/p> <p>Today, our mythology has changed. Our best understanding is that the light comes and goes because of astronomical events. Meanwhile, there are challenging mysteries we don't yet know the answer to, such as how to resolve poverty, disease and conflict.\"<\/p> <p>The Secular Solstice tells the story of how our understanding has changed over the millennia, and how we have worked to light the darkness together.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Doors open at\u00a05:30pm\u00a0for an opening reception, with the program officially starting at\u00a06:30pm.

Thank you all for coming and showing up early. We were able to get the teams set up early and each team played three games.

Mo was the MVP this week with his solid play. Eric won his lone game by attrition and is looking forward to this coming week for redemption after a plethora of interceptions.<\/p> <p>Some receivers played well, others less so but the teams that won did so as a team.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/227413250\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytqbbc","time":1450620000000,"updated":1450631632000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":2.62231636047,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":7,"created":1450068060000,"fee":{"amount":6.98999977112,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Big Goals<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Co-Ed 7 vs 7<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Please update your RSVP<\/p> <p><br\/>We are playing on Turf.<\/p> <p>Game style and Rules:<\/p> <p>\n\n\n1.

We will meet at the big Christmas Tree which is in the large circular mall type area of the station. If you exit the train area, go up steps and turn right through a long corridor with a rounded roof, it takes you to the mall section. Ask anyone where the tree is and they can tell you.

But what material proof do the oppressed have of such a politically conscious force? Perhaps traditional notions of God as \u201cgood,\u201d as \u201cmoral,\u201d as \u201cloving\u201d are actually only human attributes projected onto God with no evidence that these qualities can be traced to a divine activity actually present in the world.

With the holidays come tasty treats, big celebrations and gifts. As photographers, there are always an endless variety of accessories that we want or need and the only thing more frustrating than not having them is picking the wrong one. In anticipation of the season of giving, Brooklyn Born (a.k.a. Al) will be going over 12 items that photographers should have in their camera bags. These items are beneficial with features that can be very handy when you need them. You do not need to bring your camera gear to this workshop, but definitely bring a notepad and a pen. He will answer questions at the end of the seminar.<\/p> <p><br\/>This event will have two sessions, each 90min. 12:00pm to 1:30pm and 2:00pm to 3:30pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Biography:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adorama.com\/alc\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/bio_image\/public\/AlEspinosa_HEAD.jpg?itok=Lv0Emuji\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.adorama.com\/alc\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/bio_image\/public\/AlEspinosa_HEAD.jpg?itok=Lv0Emuji<\/a> Al Espinosa is an award winning photographer and graphic designer.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

For the entree, I ordered Lamb Chops Kebab. \u00a0Portion size was pretty large. \u00a0The lamb chops were a bit overcooked were medium rare. \u00a0However, the meat was still tender and juicy. \u00a0I opted for the grilled vegetables instead of the basmati rice. \u00a0And boy, I am glad I did. \u00a0All of my other friends were having trouble finishing cause they had so much to eat. \u00a0Nonetheless, the vegetables were all perfectly grilled. \u00a0They were soft, juicy, and had the natural sweetness and taste of the veggies..<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ravagh-persian-grill-new-york-6?reviewid=J93l3Z1dxIgQjCEMvMJrRw&amp;select=6oqIP3--j_I5I0Q2uXWAJw\">Lamb chops kebob<\/a><\/p> <p>We started with the traditional kashk bademjan, an eggplant spread served with naan. The same flavor as my old go-to but a slightly different texture; either way, delicious and no complaints! Next up: beef barg and koobideh. We were asked how we wanted it cooked - never been asked before, so we asked what they recommended. Their suggestion of medium well seemed... too cooked? so we opted for medium, which I believe was the proper choice, because the barg came out incredibly tender and full of flavor. The saffron rice comes with tomato and onion for you to use as you please (I suggest mixing the tomato in the rice). There's a healthy serving of rice, and it's light and fluffy, and not very oily (both a good and bad thing - I appreciate the less oil from a health perspective; my friend would've liked a bit more oil in it). Oh - back to the barg - full of flavor, tender, mostly cut for easy eating, definitely a must-try. A++. The koobideh was good, but not the best I've ever had, though my friend and I couldn't place why - it had good flavor, it was tender, but.. There's some improvement that could have been made to make it perfect, I just can't place it, and as it was, it was still very delicious and something I would order again - but definitely medium, not medium well.<\/p> <p>Aside from that, the staff is very polite and attentive. Authentic place, cute on the inside with enough seating to not feel cramped but also feel cozy. A must-try.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Food-Explorers-Club\/events\/227255627\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Persian Lunch in Man Sunday Dec 20 @ 1:00PM","id":"227255627","time":1450634400000,"updated":1450650199000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429888562000,"name":"New York Food Explorers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18561744,"urlname":"New-York-Food-Explorers-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Food Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437805745000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/3\/c\/600_359279452.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Note: Only RSVP if you are planning to show up.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>First Timers, READ details before you RSVP.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Where:<\/b>\u00a0The Cliffs at LIC,\u00a0[masked]th Drive,\u00a0Long Island City,\u00a0NY<\/p> <p><b>When:<\/b> We usually climb between 1:00pm and 4:00 pm.

We are happy to present to you the last Meetup for 2015. We are truly thankful to all of our amazing members and spectacular models we have had the pleasure to work with and look forward to what 2016 brings. We have a great shoot planned with non other than member favorite Ingrid Araly, who always leaves us waiting for her next visit! We also have two new models to our group, Dayderis who is a NJ local and such a pleasure to work with and we're sure she'll become a member favorite also. Maggy is also new to the group and brings such a fun attitude and always has a smile for the camera. She is the definition of a blonde bombshell!<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>\"Tis' the Season\" for a winter fashion, sexy lingerie and Christmas pinup shoot! We wanted to roll up the upcoming winter season with the Christmas holidays and of course lingerie. (We are a glamour group by the way. lol) The first look will be a fashion look. Weather permitting, we'll shoot outdoors with a more winter fashion style with a sexy twist. Our second look will be lingerie. (We will have a bed setup, a casual couch setup and a facade brick wall setup.) Our last look will be a Christmas inspired pinup look. (Everything from lingerie, swimwear or christmas outfits may be worn by the models.)<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup so you know what to expect at the shoot.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>NEW:<\/b>\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the Policy and Disclaimers section.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/227197692\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":10800000,"name":"Tis' the Season Shoot w\/Ingrid, Dayderis & Maggy - Dec. 20th","id":"227197692","time":1450634400000,"updated":1450830515000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events?and_text=False&country=us&offset=5&city=New+York&format=json&limited_events=False&access_token=69736f5dadf00155f7b410eb017b787f&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&status=past&desc=False","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":7282,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":800,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
