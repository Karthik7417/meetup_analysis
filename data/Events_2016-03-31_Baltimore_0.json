This session will focus on dashboards. Dashboards provide a visual display of your program\u2019s or organization\u2019s status. They are valuable because they quickly provide information about areas of strength and challenge, and all necessary information is available in one convenient location. During the session, Taj and Dana will talk about the basics of developing a dashboard and how to select the best medium for the visual presentation of your data (i.e., should it be a static document, or an interactive and dynamic dashboard?) They will also provide examples of dashboards and talk about aspects of DataViz design that work for programs of all varieties.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bios of Presenters<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carsonresearch.com\/who\/crc-data-nerds\/taj\/\"><b>Taj Carson, PhD<\/b><\/a>\u00a0is the CEO and founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carsonresearch.com\/\">Carson Research Consulting (CRC)<\/a>, where she oversees all aspects of CRC.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/229108876\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvfbcb","time":1456871400000,"updated":1456884007000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion in Towson","lon":-76.603523,"id":716307,"state":"MD","lat":39.396397,"repinned":false},"headcount":9,"distance":7.41901063919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456598340000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person Cash or Check","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b> Feel Fit &amp; Fabulous this March with a fun, friendly group of 8-16 people who love this <i>up<\/i>beat but <i>low-impact<\/i> Zumba dance workout!

I do not require participants to prepare for the meetings. Some people do the daily lessons at home, which are highly recommended. Some people read the chapter ahead of time to get an overview. It is nice to have your own book, but this is not mandatory for learning.

All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more. These meetings are open to all who wish to attend; there is a small fee for each meeting.<\/p> <p>For more information see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bess-md.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bess-md.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BESS-MD\/events\/228060688\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Educational Meeting!

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

Please and thank you!<\/b><\/p> <p>Our theme for our last meeting was <b><i>happiness<\/i><\/b> - and the pursuit thereof - as explained by our Toastmaster of the Evening, Hugh, as well as Andrew, who chose \"independent\" for our \"word of the day.\" Three of our four speakers were giving their second speeches. You may also recognize a couple of them from their induction photo earlier in the evening. Lindsey entertained us with her adventures in getting lost in Europe; Kelsy reminded us to be careful not to love something so much that we kill it (e.g. favorite lakes and streams); Barbara explained her GIFTS that keep on giving; and Emily talked about three key factors in a successful interview (slouching - see photo - is NOT one of them.) And a special shout-out to our guests - and a couple soon-to-be-members: Jane, Lois, Walter, Linda, Ali, Lisa and Jessica!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/collage_02_11_16.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our January 14\u00a0meeting was so special with a reporter and photographers from the Baltimore Sun, and 18 guests! Some came back for our meeting on January 28, and the others must have had conflicts. At least that's our story - and we're sticking with it. Joseph gets the \"centerfold\" in this week's collage, as he gave his icebreaker speech, telling us about his unfailing loyalty to the Terps. He proudly displays his minted gift box. Ben (a new member) jumped right in with the humorist role, imploring us to focus on the big picture and what message a speaker is telling, rather than any small, minor mistakes - no matter HOW distracting. Chuck told\u00a0us about dreaming BIG again - as we did when we were young; and Richard was interviewed\u00a0by \"WPTR\u00a0DJ\" Kameel on the secret of success. Thanks to Kelsey for bringing table topics for our outdoor connection, and Lauren for telling us about penguins and an aspect of Montessori teaching.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\"&gt;<img src=\"http:\/\/7412.toastmastersclubs.org\/imageuploads\/7412\/toastmaster_collage.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p> <p>Join us at Meetup.com<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Patuxent Toastmasters Club meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of\u00a0the month, upstairs\u00a0at the historic Oliver's Carriage House in downtown Columbia.<\/p> <p>We suggest that you arrive at 7:15 PM for some socializing; our\u00a0meetings begin promptly at 7:30 PM and end at approximately 9 PM. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bing.com\/maps\/#JnE9LjU0MTAlMmJMZWFmJTJiVHJlYWRlciUyYldheSUyNTJjJTJiQ29sdW1iaWElMjUyYyUyYk1EJTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTM5LjIyNzgyMDY4MDU\">MAP<\/a><\/p> <p>All are welcome. \u00a0Our club\u00a0offers a friendly, supportive, and\u00a0diverse\u00a0learning environment. \u00a0We have members from many different walks of life, ages, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities.\u00a0Although we meet in a community church, our club has no religious affiliations.<\/p> <p>Are you looking for speaking tips....go to toastmasters international\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Resources\/Public-Speaking-Tips<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.PatuxentToastmasters.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup\/events\/228924877\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters International Speech Contest","id":"228924877","time":1457051400000,"updated":1457059128000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397935971000,"name":"Toastmasters District 18 Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":13996962,"urlname":"Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"2600 N.

Dancing to wonderful music and rhythms, we join the circle of grandmothers who initiated these dances and passed them on. Dancing in their footsteps, we experience a sense of something greater than ourselves, a continuum of which we are a sacred part. The dances evoke a powerful sense of community and interconnection with each other and all life.<\/p> <p>In February we are still in the presence of winter, the season that calls us to rest and rejuvenate, to listen quietly and deeply to our inner being, our desires, our visions in preparation for the coming spring.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yet stillness can be challenging as the energies of spring begin to rise up! Mother Earth is busy deep within right now, teaming with life below the surface. And so are we!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Traditional Chinese Medicine explains that, in early spring, as the virgin green color fills the branches and the tree fills with the sap of life, the tree feels its potential rising up within it, along with a profound sense of being pent-up. It feels, as we feel, this pressure gradually building within, but does not yet know what it is or how it will appear; for only when its leaves burst out in the latter months of spring will its manifestation become apparent. So with us, the rising sap [can be] experienced both as joy as well as anger and impatience; trusting that this will soon find resolution can be helpful. As a Zen koan says: 'Sitting quietly, doing nothing, spring comes and the grass grows by itself.'\" ~ Jason Elias, Five Element Healing<\/p> <p>In this workshop, we will dance to honor this transition from winter to spring, the dance between stillness, restlessness and action. Rooting into the ground as we rise up, we will dance to cultivate the mindfulness needed to move forward into spring with clarity, creativity, flexibity, peace and joy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>No dance experience is required, as the dances are simple to moderately easy, and the step sequences repetitive.

Feb. 7 at 6 PM<\/b><\/p> <p>Rick Wiebush of Cross Currents Sea Kayaking has been able to get a limited number of pool sessions for CKA members this winter. These sessions are designed to help you learn to roll or improve your existing roll. They will be taught by ACA certified instructors (Mike Hamilton and Tom Malone) who are expert rollers and very supportive teachers.<\/p> <p>This class will be held at the Catonsville YMCA on Saturday\u00a0March 5\u00a0from 7 - 9 PM.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/3\/600_445724467.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What to Expect<\/b><\/p> <p>The rolling instruction will be for 1 hour 15 minutes. You will then have an additional 45 minutes of pool time to practice what you've learned, or practice other skills, or just chill out.<\/p> <p>The classes are small with just three students for each instructor. This insures that you will get plenty of attention during the session. Enrollment is limited to six people.<\/p> <p>Rolling isn't something that most people learn to do with just one lesson. So it would be best to expect that you won't actually roll. However, you will get the basic mechanics and components of your roll. Then it is a matter of a lot of practice and probably additional instruction.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We usually go out to a local bar\/restaurant afterwards.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/7\/600_445724471.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What you need<\/b><\/p> <p>1. a boat that fits you i.e. one that you do not slide all around in and fall out of as soon as you turn upside down, In general, rec boats are not good for learning to roll.<\/p> <p>2. A spray skirt that stays on the boat when you go upside down. You can't learn to roll if your spray skirt comes off by itself every time you go over.<\/p> <p>3. Warm clothing if you get cold easily. The pool is heated but some people get cold after spending so much time in the water. If you get cold easily it might be wise to wear some type of wet suit, like a farmer john or jane.<\/p> <p>4. A change of clothes. There are lockers and showers available.<\/p> <p>5. A positive attitude and a view that it is ok to not succeed on your first set of attempts.<\/p> <p>6. It is helpful is you already know how to do a wet exit. But if not, that is the very first thing you'll do at these sessions.<\/p> <p>Note: If you want to learn to roll but don't have the right kind of boat,\u00a0Chuck can make a couple of appropriate boats available.\u00a0 The rental fee is just $15 for the two hours (spray skirt included).<\/p> <p><b>Cost and Payment<\/b><\/p> <p>The cost for these sessions is $55. Here's how that breaks down: $20 for the pool + $5 for insurance + $30 for the lesson. $30 for a 75 minute rolling lesson is a fabulous price.\u00a0 Add $15 if you need a rental.<\/p> <p>You must pay when you register. Pay via Pay Pal here.<\/p> <p>Refunds will only be available if there is a waiting list and someone actually takes your spot. However, there will be a $10 administrative fee for any refunds.<\/p> <p>You will be sent a reminder and more detailed information a few days before the class.<\/p> <p><b>Answer the questions<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to register you must also answer three questions:<\/p> <p>1) what's your email address? This is so Rick or Chuck can communicate directly with you.<\/p> <p>2) do you need to rent a boat?<\/p> <p>3) do you know how to do a wet exit?<\/p> <p><b>Getting on a Wait List<\/b><\/p> <p>We want to have a wait list but that function isn't available on Meet Up when you have to pay to RSVP.\u00a0 So, if this is class is full and you want to get on the wait list, send an email to Rick at <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

Lectures take place in the concert hall and you can sit anywhere you like.<\/p> <p>Maestro<b> Jose Luis Novo<\/b> presents a program of Symphonic Titans. Mahler and Shostakovich are among the most important figures in the development of the symphony as a form, and the carriers of the traditions from late romanticism to modernism. Mahler had a clear influence in the compositional style of Shostakovich, so having both composers in the same program is a logical association that makes sense artistically. The featured performer, <b>Lynn Harrell<\/b>, has become known as one of the world's finest cellists, performing internationally as a recitalist, chamber musician, and soloist with leading orchestras and ensembles. His presence is felt throughout the musical world. A consummate soloist, chamber musician, recitalist, conductor and teacher, his work throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia has placed him in the highest echelon of today\u2019s performing artists.

The Queer Queens of Qomedy are coming back to Baltimore! Magooby\u2019s Joke House, in Timonium on March 6th, 5:00PM. March 6th national headliner Poppy Champlin is bringing her highly sought after and herlarious comedy troupe The Queer Queens of Qomedy show to Magooby\u2019s in Timonium. The Q3 show has been touring for eleven years and comic producer Poppy Champlin had such a wonderful reception in Balmore last year she is returning for more. Champlin is bringing two of her lesbian pals and nationally known comics Karen Williams and Mimi Gonzalez to share the bill Saturday March 6th at 5:00. Magooby\u2019s is a great venue to see this comedy show, the food is great the staff is wonderful and the community is welcome. Poppy is a national headliner with television credits including LOGO, Showtime, HBO, VH-1, Comedy Central, and more. Karen Williams has been leading the charge in the lesbian community for years. Karen has her own LOGO comedy special called \u201c I need a snack.\u201d She is a mother and a grandmother and now she is focusing on \u201chealing with humor\u201d at her HaHa Institute in Ohio. A regular in P-town and on Olivia Cruises Karen is a national lesbian treasure. The third Queen to rule this stage is Mimi Gonzalez, a road tested, high octane, Latina comic that has appeared on LOGO, The Today Show, and The Latino Laugh Festival. Mimi\u2019s refreshing verve for life and justice is inspiring. This show is going to be coming to you in black and white and brown and it will be a full night of wet your pants funny. Come prepared. Opening the show is local musical talent Angelique Henle. Henle\u2019s folk-rock style has been compared to that of Jewel and Sarah McLachlan. Tickets are $25 for General admission and $40 for VIP which includes a meet and greet with the comedians before the show with wine and cheese and preferred seating.

Karen has her own LOGO comedy special called \u201c I need a snack.\u201d She is a mother and a grandmother and now she is focusing on \u201chealing with humor\u201d at her HaHa Institute in Ohio.<br\/>A regular in P-town and on Olivia Cruises Karen is a national lesbian treasure. The third Queen to rule this stage is Mimi Gonzalez, a road tested, high octane, Latina comic that has appeared on LOGO, The Today Show, and The Latino Laugh Festival. Mimi\u2019s refreshing verve for life and justice is inspiring. This show is going to be coming to you in black and white and brown and it will be a full night of wet your pants funny. Come prepared. Opening the show is local musical talent Angelique Henle. Henle\u2019s folk-rock style has been compared to that of Jewel and Sarah McLachlan. Tickets are $25 for General admission and $40 for VIP which includes a meet and greet with the comedians before the show with wine and cheese and preferred seating.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/229298684\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvfblb","time":1457476200000,"updated":1457571057000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"1046 Taylor Ave, Towson, MD 21286","name":"Loch Raven Branch of the Baltimore County Public Library","lon":-76.573196,"id":24361657,"state":"MD","lat":39.38438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.99852085114,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455210596000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are going to go through strategies that are working now to find people online with social media and Google Search for free.

In a literal sense, it is a group investigating the intersection of science and spirit (or we might add, spirits). In conventional terms, the group is engaged in ghost hunting, but their work is not about ridding a place of unwanted spirits so much as it is about seeing if there is a phenomenon that can be documented, and if so, whether communication is possible with the \u201cother side.\u201d In fact, they refer to such interaction as \u201ctranscommunication.\u201d<\/p> <p>Hiram Henderson, the group\u2019s director of operations, is a retired Navy Officer. He is joined by an electrical engineer, a former flight nurse, a writer, and a former member of the Coast Guard, to name a few.

We encourage international interacting by providing channels for communications and exchange. We do this through programs providing cultural training for teachers and students; empowering students to be world leaders; developing ambassador teams in communities; opportunities for direct public interaction with people from around the world; and hosting in communities and homes. \u00a0One of their annual events is their International Film Festival.\u00a0This year we will see films from Israel, Slovakia, Philippines, Panama, and Syria. The films are co-sponsored by their respective embassies and introduced by someone associated with the project. All films will be shown Tuesday nights at 7pm at Maryland Hall (probably downstairs in the gym like last year). They will all be shown at various venues around the DC\/Baltimore metro area as well.

Puerto Rico is a volcanic island, and part of the Greater Antilles located in the north-central Caribbean between the Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic.<\/p> <p>The main island of Puerto Rico is only approximately 100 miles long by 35 miles wide, and offers diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems including coastal mangrove forests, seagrass beds, coral reefs, tropical rain forests, tropical dry forests, and coastal plains!<\/p> <p>For our trip we have chosen to escape the bustling, eastern side of Puerto Rico and head to the quieter \u2018wild western\u2019 coastal region. The super laid-back surf village of Rinc\u00f3n will be our home away from home!<\/p> <p>Rinc\u00f3n is referred to as Pueblo del Surfing (the surfing town) and El Pueblo de lost Bellos Atardeceres (the town of beautiful sunsets)! \u00a0 Not to worry, you do not have to be a surfer to enjoy all that it has to offer!<\/p> <p>Rinc\u00f3n is considered a natural and authentic seaside paradise, where emerald hills meet intimate, golden beaches. Rinc\u00f3n is located on a point of land which jets west to a point and meets the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans, and offers several distinct and intimate beaches. Each day you get to choose the beach which fits your preferred water activities!<\/p> <p>One of the coolest qualities of Rinc\u00f3n is that the separation between tourists and locals is more seamless than other resort-type towns. Aside from the beautiful beaches, the best part will be socializing with the warm, open, friendly and fun locals!\u00a0 In fact the locals will be tour guides, showing us the best spots to find relaxation, fun, food, or tropical beverages with fantastic views! We will have a great time utilizing the local entrepreneurs to enrich our trip and experiences!<\/p> <p>Rinc\u00f3n became known as one of the world\u2019s top surfing destination in 1968 when the World Surfing Championship was held at Rincon\u2019s own Domes and Maria\u2019s beaches. Generally regarded as one of the best surf spots across the globe, Rinc\u00f3n draws surfers from around the world and is the center of the island\u2019s surf scene. Dubbed the \u201cCaribbean\u2019s Hawaii, or the Hawaii of the Atlantic \u201d winter waves here can approach 25\u201330 feet (6.7m) in height, sometimes equaling the force of the surf on Oahu\u2019s north shore!<\/p> <p>Rinc\u00f3n is also emerging as a Yoga retreat destination as it offers Yogi-tourists the opportunity to practice on the beach and at open-air studios. Yogi\u2019s can even opt to challenge their practice by participating in group classes on the water with SUP yoga, in the air with Aerial yoga or combine a class with a hike in the hills.<\/p> <p>During our trip to Rinc\u00f3n we have planned just enough activities and adventures with a good amount of free time for relaxing or exploring on your own. March is the perfect time to escape winter\u2026 and no better place to break free from hibernation than Rinc\u00f3n, Puerto Rico! Whether you prefer calm waters for swimming or waters with awesome surf breaks, Rinc\u00f3n has it all! And, should you tire of beaches you can hop in a car and be up in tropical mountains within minutes! In Rinc\u00f3n you get to choose your own adventure, eat and drink in laid back Caribbean places, and even explore a quaint 240 year old town!<\/p> <p><b>About our\u00a0accommodations:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have reserved one of the best rental villas in Rincon! \u00a0Our villa is large and private AND it is right on the beach! \u00a0It is two stories with 6 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, two kitchens, two living rooms\/dining rooms, a thatched palm gazebo, swimming pool and large deck on bluff overlooking the beach! \u00a0There will be more than enough room for 12 of us to spread out and enjoy beautiful outdoor places to relax with the gang and enjoy!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Another HUGE bonus is our home is within walking distance to several little shops and restaurants! \u00a0A short walk down the beach is Tamboo; which is one of Rincon's hangouts right on the beach and features live latin music! \u00a0<\/p> <p>This trip is for both DC &amp; Baltimore Gen-Xers (only 12 people total!). \u00a0Our trip is for 5 nights (4 full days); Wednesday, March 9th - Monday, March 14th.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yoloworldtravel.com\/rincon-puerto-rico\/\">Go here<\/a> to see all the great details and to reserve your spot!\u00a0\u00a0 Reserving your spot means filling out a brief booking form and paying a 30% deposit.\u00a0 Once you do, please message me for preferred room assignment!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/7\/7\/600_440997463.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/b\/d\/600_440997533.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/8\/600_441602616.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/2\/600_441602626.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Gen-X-Travel-Club-late-30s-40s-early-50s\/events\/224680145\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":482400000,"name":"SOLD OUT - Winter getaway to Puerto Rico!","id":"224680145","time":1457524800000,"updated":1458557735000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390665516000,"name":"Baltimore Gen X Travel Club (late 30s, 40s, early 50s)","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":12446372,"urlname":"Baltimore-Gen-X-Travel-Club-late-30s-40s-early-50s","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Gen X Travelers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lutherville","address_1":"1447 York Road, Suite 408","name":"George Mason Mortgage, LLC","lon":-76.614838,"id":24390741,"state":"MD","lat":39.420021,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.00605201721,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455115141000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are a group of business professionals who know, like and trust each other.

It was originally thought this narrow view was just a construction of my own, but a brief review of the literature showed some scholarly attention to these very aspects.<\/p> <p>The two main sources used to construct what follows are\u00a0<i>Anatomy of Power<\/i>\u00a0( JK Galbraith, 1983) and<i>\u00a0Power: The Inner Experience<\/i>\u00a0(DC McClelland, 1973). The first book addressed the many aspects of power including types, sources, instruments, regulation, and dialectic. On this last point, Galbraith suggests that there is rampant discussion on power with little attention to what it really is and how it is actually used, often illustrated by the rush to accuse of exploitation and conspiracy. \u00a0M. Foucault also has expressed dissatisfaction about the prevalent negative discourse on power. He sees power is primarily a matter of administration of life and should be addressed as a system of power relations. He offers that it has positive productive effect serving as a source of creativity and innovation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>On\u00a0defining power, Galbraith and others are in concurrence that power is a state and not an action, and it is only the\u00a0possibility\u00a0of employing force to impose one\u2019s will on another. He extensively treats dominance and acquiescence as the two sides of a transaction where power is translated into force.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The McClelland book is psychological in nature and is an extensive review of research work in the motives for acquiring power. Much of the analyses are structured around the Freudian ego development model as tempered by Erikson. I say \u201ctempered\u201d as Erikson takes a less dark view of man as an inherently violent being and allows for more caring, altruistic, and empathetic dealings in collective situations.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter the building anywhere and follow the Columbia Insight Meditation signs to the room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/events\/229031745\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":5400000,"name":"Insight Meditation Class","id":"cjtwjlyvfbmb","time":1457569800000,"updated":1457577465000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334625474000,"name":"Columbia Insight Meditation Group","group_lon":-76.8700027466,"id":3684172,"urlname":"Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":20.9286556244,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457373299000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for trivia at Rams Head Roadhouse on Generals Highway.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SOCIALMARYLAND\/events\/229414381\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Trivia @ Rams Head Roadhouse (Generals Highway)","id":"229414381","time":1457569800000,"updated":1457583145000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1422213499000,"name":"Annapolis Socials (20's-30's)","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":18377925,"urlname":"SOCIALMARYLAND","group_lat":39,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"8872 McGaw Road, Suite C","name":"The Greene Turtle","lon":-76.819023,"id":24106133,"state":"MD","lat":39.188354,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.7833957672,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454604957000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Democratic Debate Watch Party!\u00a0 They haven't announced the start time that I can see so we will estimate that it will be the same as the others and we will change if needed.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maryland-Suburbs-for-Bernie-Sanders\/events\/228611218\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Debate Watch Party in Columbia","id":"228611218","time":1457571600000,"updated":1457584624000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436652312000,"name":"Maryland Suburbs for Bernie Sanders","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":18734785,"urlname":"Maryland-Suburbs-for-Bernie-Sanders","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion in Towson","lon":-76.603523,"id":716307,"state":"MD","lat":39.396397,"repinned":false},"headcount":11,"distance":7.41901063919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455912320000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person per 1 hr.","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b> Latin Survival starts here!\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p>Don't sit out another Salsa at Friday dances!<\/p> <p>We demystify the basics so that you can join the Latin dance fun wherever you are - Clubs, Cruises or your Vacation destination!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>No Partners Necessary, <\/b><b>No Experience Necessary <\/b>but a balanced class means more practice opportunities, so please consider inviting opposite gender friends!

Every day around the world, cultures celebrate, honor and signify meaningful events with toasts, usually involving a libation, heartfelt words and the clinking of glasses. Whether toasting the Almighty, the head of state, the wedding party or an award recipient, we toast for health, wealth, happiness, safe passage, healing or any of a number of noble and sometimes frivolous aspirations.<\/p> <p>Yet few people know the history behind this ritual. It\u2019s a tradition that began centuries ago. \u201cThe ancient Hebrews, Persians and Egyptians were toasters, as were the Saxons, Huns and other tribes,\u201d Paul Dickson writes in his book Toasts: Over 1,500 of the Best Toasts, Sentiments, Blessings and Graces.<\/p> <p>In his 18th-century history book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons wrote about toasting, Dickson notes. Gibbons described a feast among the Huns at which their leader, Attila, led no less than three rounds of toasts for each course of an elaborate dinner.<\/p> <p>Ancient Greeks drank to each other\u2019s health and welfare. In The Odyssey, Ulysses drank to the health of Achilles. The idea of poison\u2014which was a potent weapon in the sixth century B.C.\u2014also came into play. According to David Fulmer\u2019s book A Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Toasting, toasting was \u201ca good faith gesture to assure the drink wasn\u2019t spiked with poison.\u201d The best way to prove a drink was safe for sipping was to take the first sip. Just as a handshake assured others that nothing was hidden up one\u2019s sleeve, drinking a shared libation in front of others signified to all its worthiness for consumption.<\/p> <p>The Romans built upon this Greek custom of drinking to others\u2019 health and well-being: They added toasted bread crumbs to their goblets, reducing the acidity of the often bitter wine. Thus came the appellation \u201cto toast\u201d\u2014 referring to the drink itself\u2014from the Latin term \u201ctostus,\u201d meaning \u201cto dry up\" or \"scorch.\" In Rome, \"drinking to another\u2019s health became so important, the Senate decreed that all diners must drink to Augustus [the first Roman emperor] at every meal,\u201d Dickson writes. \u201cFabius Maximus [the Roman politician and general] declared that no man should eat or drink before he had prayed for [Maximus] and drank to his health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Clinking of Glasses<br\/>The toasting custom spread throughout Europe and England, where for the first time the clinking of glasses accompanied the ritual. Whether its intent was to mix the content of each other\u2019s glasses so everyone drank the same grog (lessening the likelihood of being poisoned), or to add sound to the experience of taste, touch, smell and sight, no one is sure.<\/p> <p>In the 17th century, toasting became very popular, says Dickson. Eventually, the position of \u201ctoastmaster\u201d emerged. In England, the toastmaster presided over events, delivering and soliciting appropriate toasts. \u201cIn those days the duties of the toastmaster tended to be referee-like in that his main function was to give all toasters a fair chance to make their contribution,\u201d writes Dickson in his book.<\/p> <p>He adds that one of the earliest books on toasting\u2014if not the earliest\u2014was The Royal Toastmaster by J. Roach, published in London in 1791. Roach\u2019s view was that the toast is a very powerful ritual. Consider this passage from his book:<\/p> <p>A Toast or Sentiment very frequently excites good humor, and revives languid conversation; often does it, when properly applied, cool the heat of resentment, and blunt the edge of animosity. A well-applied Toast is acknowledged, universally, to soothe the flame of acrimony, when season and reason oft used their efforts to no purpose.<\/p> <p>To this day, one can find the National Association of Toastmasters in the United Kingdom\u2014whose trained members wear ceremonial red dinner jackets and are skilled at oratory, poetry and toasting. They emcee events of all varieties, from weddings and funerals to christenings and fundraisers.<\/p> <p>Dickson describes a Golden Age of toasting in America during the 40-year period from approximately 1880 to 1920. Many prominent authors wrote toasts, toast books and pamphlets were published, and newspapers ran columns on the subject. One periodical, The National Magazine, had its own Toasts editor, whose duties included judging the best toasts in a monthly contest, Dickson says.<\/p> <p>Traveling Toasts<br\/>Worldwide, numerous nations and cultures have their own toasting customs. Many are similar to each other yet others are unique. For example, in Japan, China and Korea, the customary toasts sound very similar but are pronounced differently. According to the Matador Network (www.matadornetwork.com), a site devoted to travel journalism, toasters in Japan say the word kanpai and pronounce it \u201ckan-pie\u201d; in China they say gan bei and pronounce it \u201cgan bay\u201d; in Korea they say gonbae and pronounce it \u201cgun bae.\u201d<\/p> <p>And Korean toasting customs differ from the Japanese. \u201cIn Korea, the glass is emptied and the last few drops are shaken out, then it is passed to the guest and the host refills the glass,\u201d says the website Etiquette International (www.etiquetteinternational.com). \u201cA glass is never refilled until it is completely empty in Korea, whereas in Japan the glass is constantly refilled so it is never empty.\u201d<\/p> <p>If you\u2019re going to make a toast in another country, notes the site, be sure to find out the toasting customs there \u201cbefore putting your foot in your mouth.\u201d \u201cToasts don\u2019t necessarily translate well, especially if they are idiomatic or poetic,\u201d adds Etiquette International. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to stick to safe topics like friendship, the enjoyment of life and health.\u201d<\/p> <p>The ancient and international tradition of toasting is no doubt one that will endure for many more years. Let\u2019s hope the future of the toast is as engrossing as its past.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.PatuxentToastmasters.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup\/events\/228775844\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters leadership and communication skills meeting.","id":"rvhxjlyvfbnb","time":1457656200000,"updated":1457663287000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397935971000,"name":"Toastmasters District 18 Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":13996962,"urlname":"Toastmasters-District-18-Meetup","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21114","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Crofton","address_1":"1657 Crofton Parkway","name":"Prince of Peace Presbyterian","lon":-76.695786,"id":9463082,"state":"MD","lat":39.007793,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.9575214386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454174337000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This week Single Again Crofton a guest speaker will be speaking on the topic <b>\"<b>Feelings:\u00a0 Then &amp; Now<\/b>\". \u00a0<\/b>How did we feel when we first separated?\u00a0 What has happened to those feelings over time?\u00a0 Am I still just putting one foot in front of the other, and living on \"auto pilot\"?\u00a0 Do I continue to blame others or have I come to terms with my part in the events that have happened?\u00a0 Do I continue to throw myself into activities (work, the children, binge drinking\/eating\/etc.) to avoid dealing with my new \"normal\" or have I started to move forward into reshaping my new life?\u00a0 These are all questions that each of us is dealing with every day.\u00a0 Come to Single Again tomorrow evening and share your thoughts and ideas on how feelings are shaping you into the new person whom you are becoming. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nOrientation Meeting begins at 7:00 PM for new members<\/p> <p>Regular Meeting begins at 7:30 PM<\/p> <p>Then there will be small-group break-out sessions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainCrofton\/events\/228682548\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":6300000,"name":"Single Again - Crofton","id":"ldtsplyvfbnb","time":1457656200000,"updated":1457714277000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282432684000,"name":"Changing Focus - Single Again in Crofton","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1694643,"urlname":"SingleAgainCrofton","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"5410 Leaf Treader Way","name":"Historic Oliver's Carriage House","lon":-76.853661,"id":9360452,"state":"MD","lat":39.223598,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.3434028625,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457134399000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>March PATUXENT TOASTMASTERS meeting<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Join us for our next Toastmasters meeting on March 10. <\/b>Typically, Patuxent Toastmasters Club meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of every month.

Think potatoes. \u00a0Also brown rice, corn, other whole grains, beans dishes, etc., etc., etc. \u00a0These are unprocessed starchy foods. \u00a0(Did you know that 90% of the carbohydrates Americans eat are processed??) \u00a0A good rule of thumb, according to our friend Chef A.J., is to have the salad or veggies \u201cbefore the good stuff,\u201d \u00a0i.e. before the healthy, satisfying carbohydrates.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your four organizers, Joe, Vlad, Emily and Jamila, will be on hand to help and advise you during and after this meeting.

We'll share a pot luck lunch starting at 12:00 and then go right into this meetup. This meetup involves listening to the audio version of Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche's book \"Rebel Buddha\" and then holding a discussion about the material afterwards. This book is a great entry point for westerners who are looking to understand the Buddhist path. It is very pithy, and adapted to our cultural understanding. Here is a brief description from Rinpoche about the contents of this book:<\/p> <p>\"There\u2019s a rebel within you. It\u2019s the part of you that already knows how to break free of fear and unhappiness. This rebel is the voice of your own awakened mind. It\u2019s your rebel buddha\u2014the sharp, clear intelligence that resists the status quo. It wakes you up from the sleepy acceptance of your day-to-day reality and shows you the power of your enlightened nature. It\u2019s the vibrant, insightful energy that compels you to seek the truth.\"<\/p> <p>We'll be playing the book from its audio version.

Once he's satisfied he has a lady woodcock's attention he will spiral up into the sky, flying higher and higher until only the sharpest of eyes can follow it, and then back down again, squeaking and chittering all the way. Then he'll land on the exact same spot and do it all again! Sometimes there are several birds vying for the attentions of the female.

No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Within these nocturnal black-and-white striped tents awaits an utterly unique, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Welcome to Le Cirque des R\u00eaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Beyond the smoke and mirrors, however, a fierce competition is under way--a contest between two young illusionists, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood to compete in a \"game\" to which they have been irrevocably bound by their mercurial masters. Unbeknownst to the players, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the circus travels around the world, the feats of magic gain fantastical new heights with every stop. The game is well under way and the lvies of all those involved--the eccentric circus owner, the elusive contortionist, the mystical fortune-teller, and a pair of red-headed twins born backstage among them--are swept up in a wake of spells and charms.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But when Celia discovers that Marco is her adversary, they begin to think of the game not as a competition but as a wonderful collaboration. With no knowledge of how the game must end, they innocently tumble headfirst into love. A deep, passionate, and magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Their masters still pull the strings, however, and this unforeseen occurrence forces them to intervene with dangerous consequences, leaving the lives of everyone from the performers to the patrons hanging in the balance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Carnel-Columbia-Book-Club\/events\/229014597\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"March 2nd Meetup: Night Circus","id":"229014597","time":1457827200000,"updated":1457838911000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1407495373000,"name":"Carnal in Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":16261092,"urlname":"Carnel-Columbia-Book-Club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21046","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"10440 Shaker Dr. Suite 105","lon":-76.870186,"phone":"410-992-3001","name":"Nourishing Journey","id":1531297,"state":"MD","lat":39.185261,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":11,"headcount":0,"distance":15.2502593994,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1454100561000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join Intuitive <b>Medium Sarah Martucci and Intuitive Psychic Nancy Andrews<\/b> for a Spirit Message Gallery!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north.

The center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis. <b>This book was a topic before, but we are starting the class anew, studying the beginning of the text on February 21, 2016.<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The class will center on the book \u201cThe Essence of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its Philosophy and Practice\u201d by Traleg Kyabgon.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The class will be led by Tree Marr, a senior student of Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche's.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The \u201cThe Essence of Buddhism\u201d is a very clear and comprehensive explanation and overview of Buddhism. One reviewer notes, \u201cAlthough this book is immense in its scope, Traleg Kyabgon never allows us to lose sight of the key point and ultimate meaning of all the Buddha\u2019s teachings: that it is possible to get to the root of suffering and to bring about lasting happiness for ourselves and others; and that the only way to do this is to work with, understand, tame, and transform our mind.\u201d<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will read the text aloud and then discuss it. It is not necessary to own or read the book in advance to attend a meeting. But people who plan to attend regularly are encouraged to own a copy of the book. People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to join in and share in the conversation. Visitors and members have access to all sessions on a drop-in basis; no advance registration is required. People can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able.<\/p> <p>Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center, and each meeting will open and close with the recitation of short prayers and mantras from a prayer book. There is no need to own a copy of the prayer book for these Sunday sessions because copies will be available.<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>It is the Gampopa Center\u2019s wish to provide teachings and on a no-charge basis for those wish to explore Buddhism. While there is no fee for weekly sessions, attendees are encouraged to make a small donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a><\/a> for more information.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/3\/600_444870083.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Tree Marr<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gampopa-Center-Meetup-Annapolis\/events\/229412508\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"NEW: Start Studying the \"Essence of Buddhism\" Book","id":"xhjmqlyvfbrb","time":1457879400000,"updated":1457886643000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432809297000,"name":"Gampopa Center Meetup (Annapolis)","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":18631483,"urlname":"Gampopa-Center-Meetup-Annapolis","group_lat":39,"who":"Friends and members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":5,"distance":2.82083773613,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406819134000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Like Signing Brunch Saturday, just on a different day so everyone can attend sometime.<\/p> <p>This venue is spacious, well-lit, and not too busy on weekend mornings.

The annual St. Patrick parade is one of Baltimore's best and a welcome harbinger of spring. It always draws a large and enthusiastic crowd.<\/p> <p>Our SHR group attended the Baltimore St. Patrick parade for the past two years and really enjoyed watching as it passed us on Pratt St. near the Inner Harbor area. In addition to traditional marching bands of pipes &amp; drums, we saw St. Patrick waving from a white float, Ancient Hibernian organizations, brightly-festooned mummer string bands, Pets on Wheels, and groups of dancing girls to lift our spirits. There are street vendors selling food and Irish trinkets at the parade, as well as a number of bars along the route.<\/p> <p>For those who want better food and drinks and a warm restroom, the Kona Grill is near our viewing spot on the parade route. Kona is a sushi and Asian-themed restaurant that has an attractive ground floor location on Pratt St. with large windows, good bathrooms, an open bar area, and a variety of tasty appetizers. It's a nice place to go after the parade too.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/kona-grill-baltimore\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/kona-grill-baltimore\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/kona-grill-baltimore<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/d\/d\/600_433317053.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/f\/2\/600_433317074.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/2\/1\/600_433317121.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Meetup and Parking on Federal Hill<\/b><\/p> <p>Driving and parking in downtown Baltimore\u00a0around Inner Harbor\u00a0will be difficult due to parade street closings and the crowd of parade-goers. Consequently, it makes sense for our group to first meet at the Cross Street Market. We always enjoy the casual fun, food, and beer at Nick's while standing in the aisles around barrel tables. Although the rest of Cross Street Market is closed on Sundays, you can enter Nick's from the entrance on Charles St. It's a good place for us to warm up for the parade.<\/p> <p>From Cross Street Market, it's an easy half mile walk past the Inner Harbor to Pratt St. where we'll be viewing the parade. The St. Patrick's Day parade starts at Baltimore's Washington Monument at 2:00 pm, which means it will probably begin passing the Inner Harbor around 2:30 pm after marching down Charles St.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/6\/e\/600_445726190.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/7\/e\/600_445726206.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Federal Hill is an urban area with limited street parking. The best place to park near Cross Street Market is the West Street Parking Garage located at\u00a040 E West St. It's operated by the City of Baltimore and parking costs about $15 for the afternoon. The garage is just one block away from Cross Street Market, so it's very convenient.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Final Details<\/b><\/p> <p>The parade should go rain or shine, so we'll plan to be there!

However, depending on your background, it can be one of your biggest stumbling blocks. Maybe you grew up hearing that it's not polite to talk about yourself or to \"brag.\" Or maybe you have opinions about \"salespeople\" and you don't want to be one of \"them.\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Now you're you in business for yourself where you must talk about yourself, what you offer and how good you are at offering it. It's not always an easy transition. Or maybe you were an excellent salesperson ...for someone else. Sales skills don't always transfer easily from selling someone else's dream. But when it's your own dream and the perceived rejection feels personal...it can stop you in your tracks. Couple all of that with not being sure what to say and how to say it when you do talk about yourself and it can sometimes feel overwhelming. Ginny Robertson will take you through a process that can help you identify what it is that you're offering and how to talk about it with more Confidence, Grace &amp; Ease.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/7\/5\/600_442301333.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>Ginny Robertson<\/b> is President of Ginny Robertson LLC, an organization that \u201cConnects Women Around the World to their Gifts, Their Purpose and Each Other.\u201d She facilitates workshops, conferences and retreats and speaks to large numbers of women\u2019s groups throughout the year.

But, there are some interesting ways Vim can be interacted with from the command line, and I'll explore a few of those in this talk.<\/p> <p>-----<\/p> <p>Scheduled Beer:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/flyingdogbrewery.com\/?beers=naughty\">Flying Dog \"Naughty\"<\/a>, a seasonal 9% Belgian-style dark ale. \"Brewed with habanero peppers and orange peel, Naughty packs heat and subtle citrus sweetness.

These are tennis players who love the sport and joined the program to meet up with you on the courts. The Partner Program is less competitive as there are no champions crowned and no league standings. The program provides dedicated tennis partners who want to meet up with you on the courts.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0TennisBaltimore's tennis partner program is broken down to these playing regions: Baltimore,\u00a0 North Baltimore County,\u00a0 South Baltimore County,\u00a0 West Baltimore County.<\/p> <p>\u00a0The partner program is a monthly subscription service. The Partner Program is ongoing and remains open as long as the weather is good enough to play outdoor tennis. This is NOT a doubles program.<\/p> <p><b>Your Task-\"Scheduling and Meeting up with the other players\"<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 You meet up with the players to play either a match or just hit around. TennisBaltimore's objective to ensure players are actively playing. We try to use an incentive system to push players along. Anyone who plays 3 different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service for free.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The league strongly suggests that players jointly choose a tennis court location convenient to both. We now geo-locate your program contacts which means you should receive partners closer to your preferred playing location. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tennisbaltimore.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> for each area, including details such as # of courts, lighting, hitting walls and links to google maps for directions. Members can submit court ratings on the overall condition, surface, lighting quality, facility management, and general comments regarding specific courts. This will provide players with up-to-date court information on new and existing courts. We encourage members to keep this list fresh and up-to-date.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The Partner Program is for all level players. We encourage beginners to play in the Partner Program prior to playing in a league. We track the results of the Partner Program and may make skill rating adjustments based upon scores if necessary. Our program ensures fun, well-matched tennis partners for players of all levels.<br\/>Admin Note: This program typically has players from 2.0 to 3.5+ level enrolled. In most locations 4.0 and 4.5+ level players will not find this program worthwhile.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The cost will be no greater than $9\/month to participate in the program. Any player that plays 3 or more different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service at no cost. In some *NEW* cities the program will be free as we are trying to build a dedicated tennis playing community.

Anna works as a data engineer at ViaSat Inc., where she is also a member of the User Experience Council. Earlier she worked as a full-stack developer, designing and developing web applications used for real-time monitoring and network management. Faced with challenges of efficiently visualizing and displaying data, Anna became interested in the UX (user experience) design field. UX design is her hobby and she is always looking for frameworks and libraries that employ principles of good design and allow for rapid web development.<\/p> <p>Please note the new location for this meeting.

We expect this to be a popular meeting, so please help us out \u2013 if you plan to attend, RSVP with one of these meetup groups (but not both).<\/p> <p>Our speaker, Anna Kepler, has that rare combination of both left-brain and right-brain talents. Anna works as a data engineer at ViaSat Inc., where she is also a member of the User Experience Council. Earlier she worked as a full-stack developer, designing and developing web applications used for real-time monitoring and network management. Faced with challenges of efficiently visualizing and displaying data, Anna became interested in the UX (user experience) design field. UX design is her hobby and she is always looking for frameworks and libraries that employ principles of good design and allow for rapid web development.<\/p> <p>Please note the new location for this meeting. We will meet at AOL, which is next to the famous Natty Boh tower on Brewer's Hill in Baltimore. There is plenty of free parking in front of the building, on adjacent streets, and in a parking lot a block away on the other side of O'Donnell Street.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/1\/9\/600_447189497.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Doors will open at 6:30 PM for pizza and conversation, and the presentation will start at 7:00 PM.<\/p> <p><br\/>After Anna Kepler\u2019s presentation, keep the conversation going with drinks (buy your own) at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ofloveandregret.com\/\">Of Love and Regret Pub<\/a>.
