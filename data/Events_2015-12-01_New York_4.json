Another reason to go back is the potential for a free beer! There is a new iOs app that is launching called \"First Call\" that is a subscription based service that let's you get your first drink free at specific bars. The development team reached out to beer club and it sounds like it might have appeal to some of you beer lovers out there.<\/p> <p>In the next day or two, I'll post another message about how to download the app, what the details are and how to get a week for free (it's usually $10 per week). I also want to note that I am not an investor in the app, I'm not getting any kickbacks or anything for sharing it with the group and I'm not endorsing it one way or the other. Just having discussions with the First Call development team, I thought it sounded interesting and knew that it would be a really great app for some people and it doesn't cost anything to try it out.<\/p> <p>So look for the message about how to download the app on your iPhone (sorry Android people, like me) later this week.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

How can we men awaken to a more empowered masculine presence? Where is our edge and how do we find the strength and support to live a life of action and accountability in alignment with our deepest purpose? This is an invitation for all men who wish to explore their masculinity through empowering challenges and inspiring feedback in a supportive group environment. The Brotherhood, a tribe of men who gather every week, will be leading this open Men's Workshop on Wednesday, November 11th at 7:30pm. We will be collecting $10 per participant.<\/p> <p>It's our Mission to create a safe and sacred space to allow our Brothers to take off their armor, put down their shields, and open themselves to the strength and beauty of challenging interactions and exercises with other men, as well as giving and receiving supportive feedback within a group dynamic. This gathering is an introduction to Men\u2019s Work open to both newcomers and experienced men who would like to connect with other conscious men. Bring a friend, a co-worker, a brother -- you know who they are!<br\/>Come celebrate with other men who are committed to living their deepest truth and offering their greatest gifts.<\/p> <p>ADDITIONAL INFO:<\/p> <p>What is the Brotherhood?\u00a0<br\/>We are men of action who challenge and support each other to live free and authentic lives. Five Reasons For A Man To Join a Men's Group:\u00a0<br\/>Paraphrased from David Deida\u2019s \"The Way of the Superior Man\u201d<\/p> <p>1) BE IN THE COMPANY OF OTHER MEN - A man discovers and fine-tunes his purpose in solitude, in challenging situations, and in the company of other men who won't settle for his bullshit. A man\u2019s capacity to receive another mans direct criticism is a measure of his capacity to receive masculine energy.<\/p> <p>2) HAVE MEN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE FOR LIVING YOUR DEEPEST PURPOSE - Your mission is your priority. Unless you know your mission and have aligned your life to it, your core will feel empty. Your presence in the world will be weakened, as will your presence with your intimate partner.<\/p> <p>3) FIND MEN WHO ARE AS DEDICATED AS YOU ARE - Be in the company of other men who have dedicated their lives to integrity, truth, and the heart. Your dedication will inspire each other to live with an open heart and give your deepest gifts of love, mission and presence.<\/p> <p>4) SUPPORT YOUR EDGE WITH OTHER MEN - Choose male friends who themselves are living at their edge, facing their fears and living just beyond them. Men of this kind can empower you to confront the necessary realities that your life involves.<\/p> <p>5) CUT THROUGH YOUR BS - At least once a week, get together with your men friends to serve one another. Cut through the bullshit and talk with each other straight. Welcome such criticisms from your friends. Suggest challenges for each other to take on in order to bring each other through limiting fears.<\/p> <p>Location: Chelsea Studios: 151 West 26th Street New York, NY\u00a0<br\/>When: November 11th,[masked]:30-9:30pm\u00a0<br\/>Please be punctual, late arrivals will be turned away.

Whether you are in a relationship, or in between, this evening will allow your soul to grow and expand into its true desire for higher harmony and creative purpose in relationship.<\/p> <p>Guests Chela and Pedro of Sacred Soul Union embody the Twin Flame frequency, an evolutionary resonance uniting and balancing the divine masculine and feminine frequencies. The Twin Flame union pertains to all relationships in the spectrum of sexual orientation. They extend their joint healership as an offering to foster balance in this time of great, accelerated transformation.<\/p> <p>Many Twin Flame couples are reuniting at this time, which beyond the personal is helping to heal the planet. This is by balancing distortions in gender that have caused suffering for so long on the planet, allowing a new type of leadership to emerge balanced in qualities of the divine feminine.<\/p> <p>Being in relationship has a way of mirroring our full selves, the light and shadow, and can bring forth challenging aspects of ourselves that were previously unrecognized to be acknowledged, accepted, healed and transmuted. Paradoxically, it is also a way of experiencing in this earthly dimension the immense joy and bliss of how we are loved by spirit. The frequencies from this gathering intend to facilitate navigating these two aspects.<\/p> <p>In order to manifest anything, we must first resonate at its' frequency. In this quantum leap space between \"what is\" and \"what is possible\" as it pertains to a sacred relationship, it is our intention that our offerings can assist to others so that the partner and relationship shows up with ease. This also applies to taking an existing relationship to a next level, or doing personal healing work as it relates to oneself.<\/p> <p>Pedro and Chela have extended this work for the past two years to hundreds of recipients, and recently celebrated their wedding June of 2014. Their work is a testament to the power of love, harmony and acceptance in relationship. They have assisted many individuals in manifesting a partnership after a Twin Flame Activation, or deepening into new levels of intimacy and harmony with their current partner. Some have even met their beloved at a Twin Flame Activation event!\u201d \u2013Pedro and Chela Rosas<\/p> <p><br\/>About Sacred Soul Union, Chela and Pedro:<br\/>Sacred Soul Union is the joint endeavor of healers Chela and Pedro Rosas. Together Chela and Pedro embody the \u201cTwin Flame\u201d frequency and commit their work together in healing service to the planet, to bring the sacred masculine and feminine into balance (as they relate to all spectrums of sexual orientation) and to assist others in finding fulfillment in sacred partnership.<\/p> <p>Pedro De Las Rosas is divine channel, medium, shamanic healer and reverend.

Whether you are in a relationship, or in between, this evening will allow your soul to grow and expand into its true desire for higher harmony and creative purpose in relationship.<\/p> <p>Guests Chela and Pedro of Sacred Soul Union embody the Twin Flame frequency, an evolutionary resonance uniting and balancing the divine masculine and feminine frequencies. The Twin Flame union pertains to all relationships in the spectrum of sexual orientation. They extend their joint healership as an offering to foster balance in this time of great, accelerated transformation.<\/p> <p>Many Twin Flame couples are reuniting at this time, which beyond the personal is helping to heal the planet. This is by balancing distortions in gender that have caused suffering for so long on the planet, allowing a new type of leadership to emerge balanced in qualities of the divine feminine.<\/p> <p>Being in relationship has a way of mirroring our full selves, the light and shadow, and can bring forth challenging aspects of ourselves that were previously unrecognized to be acknowledged, accepted, healed and transmuted. Paradoxically, it is also a way of experiencing in this earthly dimension the immense joy and bliss of how we are loved by spirit. The frequencies from this gathering intend to facilitate navigating these two aspects.<\/p> <p>In order to manifest anything, we must first resonate at its' frequency. In this quantum leap space between \"what is\" and \"what is possible\" as it pertains to a sacred relationship, it is our intention that our offerings can assist to others so that the partner and relationship shows up with ease. This also applies to taking an existing relationship to a next level, or doing personal healing work as it relates to oneself.<\/p> <p>Pedro and Chela have extended this work for the past two years to hundreds of recipients, and recently celebrated their wedding June of 2014. Their work is a testament to the power of love, harmony and acceptance in relationship. They have assisted many individuals in manifesting a partnership after a Twin Flame Activation, or deepening into new levels of intimacy and harmony with their current partner. Some have even met their beloved at a Twin Flame Activation event!\u201d \u2013Pedro and Chela Rosas<\/p> <p><br\/>About Sacred Soul Union, Chela and Pedro:<br\/>Sacred Soul Union is the joint endeavor of healers Chela and Pedro Rosas. Together Chela and Pedro embody the \u201cTwin Flame\u201d frequency and commit their work together in healing service to the planet, to bring the sacred masculine and feminine into balance (as they relate to all spectrums of sexual orientation) and to assist others in finding fulfillment in sacred partnership.<\/p> <p>Pedro De Las Rosas is divine channel, medium, shamanic healer and reverend. Born in Venezuela, he was initiated in Curanderismo at the age of 16. The culmination of his healership incorporates his practice of healing arts, shamanism, Buddhism and sound healing. Pedro feels a deep connection to his ancestry and has been actively guided by his great-grandmother, who was a renowned healer in Chile during the 20th century. Pedro is a ceremonial leader and is in service to the community through shamanic healing ceremonies and sweat lodges. He is guided by native traditions from the Amazon and other lineages. Pedro is also a celebrated documentary photographer, a skill that he employs to bring truth, justice and harmony to the planet.<\/p> <p>Lauren \"Chela\" Harkrader Rosas is a Brennan Healing Science Practitioner, Reiki Master, doula and Reverend in the Oder of Melchizedek.

Both humans and animals rely on the natural processes of light and darkness for healthy functioning, yet when the night sky is unnaturally and perpetually aglow, circadian rhythms are interrupted. Our sleep patterns can be negatively affected resulting in increased stress, fatigue, and anxiety. The migration of patterns of wildlife, and the feeding and reproduction habits of nocturnal animals are frequently thrown off-course. And the energy costs to society for having artificial lights glaring 24\/7 has become unsupportable. The recent implementation of energy-saving outdoor lighting (such as the LED street light program in NYC) is reducing energy use but may not be adequately addressing human health and light pollution issues.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This symposium will explore these issues and discuss both current and incoming solutions - Outdoor lights to design downward instead of upward or outward, sensors that turn outdoor lights off when not needed, and communities that demand technologically-advanced public and private night-lighting. These solutions can not only reduce the amount of energy and light used, but will also contain reflected and scattered light waves.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>-\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/be-exchange.org\/events\/156\">REGISTER BY CLICKING HERE<\/a>\u00a0-<\/b><\/p> <p>The esteemed panel will include Jason Neches of L'Observatoire International, a leading lighting design consultancy spearheading the push to reduce nightglow, and Fred Maxik of Light Science Group, a leading manufacturer of advanced lighting products.<\/p> <p><b>SPEAKERS<\/b><br\/>Jason Neches, Director,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/lobsintl.com\/\">L'Observatoire International<\/a><br\/>Fred Maxik, Chief Technology Officer &amp; Founding Member,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lsgc.com\/\">Lighting Science Group<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/107.170.140.134\/media\/Logo_AIACEU_1.5-7.png\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYPassiveHouse-NYC\/events\/226420679\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"The Dark Side of Light:  Light Pollution (BEEx Event)","id":"226420679","time":1447336800000,"updated":1447343612000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1257778915000,"name":"NY Passive House (NYPH) Meetup: New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1554052,"urlname":"NYPassiveHouse-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Passivists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10801","country":"us","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"Ronalds Ln","name":"Ronalds Ln","lon":-73.79644,"id":3641532,"state":"Ne","lat":40.90155,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":14.5917892456,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1351013941000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"Per family","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Zev is a great music teacher.

And invite friends ... the more the merrier.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: As we are using space at a business, please be sure to make purchases at the cafe to ensure our arrangement with them is upheld and we are allowed to stick around.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the group in the upstairs seating area","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Id-Tap-That-Brooklyn-Chapter-Casual-Magic-the-Gathering\/events\/226518244\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":21600000,"name":"Mid-week Magic MADNESS in Manhattan (well not really that mad)","id":"mnnnflytpbqb","time":1447365600000,"updated":1447462511000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357839413000,"name":"I'd Tap That - NYC Chapter (Casual Magic the Gathering)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":6591412,"urlname":"Id-Tap-That-Brooklyn-Chapter-Casual-Magic-the-Gathering","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Tappers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"27 W 44th St","name":"Harvard Club of New York City","lon":-73.981316,"id":23734157,"lat":40.755367,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.587603032589,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447330295000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>JOIN US TO SAY THANKS!

The multi-dimensional problem is made tractable via a novel computational method, which generalizes the one-dimensional fractional partial differential equation method of Itkin, 2014 to the two- and three-dimensional cases. This method is unconditionally stable and of the second order of approximation in space and time; in addition, for many popular Levy models it has linear complexity in each dimension. Marginal and joint survival probabilities for two and three banks with mutual liabilities are computed. The effects of mutual liabilities are discussed, and numerical examples are given to illustrate these effects.<\/p> <p>(Joint work with Alex Lipton)<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p>Dr. Andrey Itkin is an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Department of Risk and Financial Engineering and Director, Senior Research Associate at Bank of America.\u00a0 He received his PhD in physics of liquids, gases and plasma, and degree of Doctor of Science in computational molecular physics.

We deal with many varied data sets across different business units, including auction data, campaigns, behavior and content. Data sizes are in petabytes across multi-100 node clusters. Given the heterogeneous development and production environments across our different groups, we are missing out on the opportunity for uniting the capabilities and experience of many strong data scientists across the organization through easy sharing of knowledge and expertise gained over challenging project experiences.<\/p> <p>In this discussion, we will share the types of problems we tackle and the ways that we approach solving them through machine learning and data engineering. We will touch on some of the practical issues involved, such as data challenges and production deployment challenges. We will also talk about the platforms we have used and what we are still looking for in terms of an Enterprise-grade machine learning platform.<\/p> <p><b>BIO - GIRI IYENGAR<\/b><\/p> <p>Giri Iyengar is a Chief Architect in the Data Services tribe at AOL Platforms. He works on Data Science projects and bringing them into production at large scale at AOL. At AOL he has worked on pricing models, forecasting models, user matching models and yield optimization. Prior to AOL, he was the CTO of Velos, a Machine Learning startup that was acquired by AOL earlier this year. He started his career as a Research Scientist at IBM TJ Watson Lab after his PhD from MIT.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><b>2.\u00a0 Presentation by IBM<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Open Source Analytics - Domain Specific Analytics with System ML.<\/b><\/p> <p>Declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) in SystemML aims at flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations to distributed computations on MapReduce or Spark. ML algorithms are expressed in an R-like syntax or a Python-like syntax, that includes linear algebra primitives, statistical functions, and ML-specific constructs. This high-level language significantly increases the productivity of data scientists as it provides:<br\/>- full flexibility in expressing custom analytics, and<br\/>data independence from the underlying input formats and physical data representations.<br\/>- automatic optimization according to data and cluster characteristics ensures both efficiency and scalability. As such, SystemML differs from existing work on large-scale ML libraries, which mostly provide fixed algorithms and runtime plans.<\/p> <p>In June 2015, IBM announced to open source SystemML and include it in the Apache Spark project. The open source repository is here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SparkTC\/systemml\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/SparkTC\/systemml<\/a><\/p> <p>This meetup will provide a high level overview of System ML and cover use cases and client examples of how System ML is used.<\/p> <p><b>3.

The result is new insight into a man whose life and career made an indelible and everlasting impact on entertainment and culture. <b>Harry Weinger<\/b>, a special consultant to the film and a two-time Grammy(R) winner, will lead a panel discussion following the screening.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.hbowatch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Doc_MrDynamitePoster.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u201cA smart, informative and compassionate look at the artist known as the Godfather of Soul, whose music changed America.\u201d \u2013 <b>The New York Times<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u201cAs honest as it could possibly be\u2026 This documentary did a lot right\u2026 (it) is incredible and is a must see.\u201d \u2013 <b>The Source<\/b><\/p> <p>Join in on the discussion! \u00a0Tweet us your questions at <b>@ApolloEd<\/b> using <b>#ApolloLW<\/b> and someone may answer them during the event!<\/p> <p><br\/>###########<\/p> <p><b>Our Meetup!<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet in\u00a0the Apollo Theater lobby at 6pm, then head\u00a0up as a group around 6:30pm.\u00a0If you need to arrive later than\u00a06:30pm, it's ok - just state that you're with the HarlemGo Meetup group at the desk - but, please try to arrive as close to 6:30pm as possible for best seating - <b>the event is scheduled to be at capacity!<\/b><\/p> <p>As always, if you have any questions, comments, running late, trying to find us at the venue, or to check on last minute status updates on the event, please use the comments\/notifications section below or feel free to call\/text me\u00a0<b>Daniel<\/b>\u00a0@ 774.275.3646.

To succeed as designers within large government bureaucracies, we need passion, skill, a deep understanding of our context and an unfettered dedication to creating the best possible experience for our users - the American people. Mollie will share stories from her design teams inside of the government working to build beautiful human-centered public services. We'll hear about the role of UX and the process for delivering great government products, as well as learn about opportunities for you to get involved in these efforts to bring innovation and design into our 21st century government.<\/p> <p>Mollie is a founding member of the U.S. Digital Service, where she works to improve the government's ability to deliver beautiful, human and intuitive technology and services. For the past ten years, Mollie has worked at the intersection of design and social justice, beginning as an advocate and community organizer before turning to a career in design.<\/p> <p>In 2013, Mollie served as a Presidential Innovation Fellow at the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, where she led an human-centered design project to improve Veterans\u2019 experiences with VA services. At the US Digital Service, she has worked on projects ranging from immigration to social security benefits, always bringing the needs of the people to the forefront of how services are designed. Most recently, Mollie led the effort to create the U.S. Web Design Standards to create a federal government web design system.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-UX-Lab-NYC\/events\/226565304\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"name":"Suggested Event: NYC World Usability Day 2015 (Purchase Ticket Through UXPA)","id":"226565304","time":1447369200000,"updated":1447381798000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1380848909000,"name":"The UX Lab NYC","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10543362,"urlname":"The-UX-Lab-NYC","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"UX Designers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"306 Lenox Ave, 3rd Floor","name":"Harlem United","lon":-73.945183,"id":24098038,"state":"NY","lat":40.80806,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.65596008301,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442494025000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for a speedwork out for all abilities in Harlem!

SMS is often underestimated, but is a powerful tool for prototyping these conversations. From design research to hacked simulations of products and services, SMS is a simple tool that goes a long way.<\/p> <p>In this session of Designers + Geeks, we'll cover the spectrum of building conversations with users at different stages of the design process, and ways to start doing your own prototyping by leveraging IDEO case studies.<\/p> <p>David Boardman is a Senior Design Lead at IDEO New York. He leads the Interaction Design discipline, and guides teams that design across multiple touch points to elevate people's experiences and create innovative new businesses. David has contributed to bringing several complex digital ecosystems to life in a broad set of industries including healthcare, the public sector, finance, and media.<\/p> <p>Sera Koo is a Senior Interaction Designer at IDEO New York. Her work focuses on shaping the experience of users across digital products and services. As an expert in user experience, Sera's work has covered a range of topics including design strategy for digital platforms, UI design and best practices, and rapid prototyping.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Connect<\/b><\/p> <p>We post discounts &amp; freebies here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.designersandgeeks.com\/?ref=meetup\">Our Newsletter<\/a> \u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/designersandgeeks\">Designers + Geeks Facebook<\/a> \u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DesignersGeeks\">@DesignersGeeks<\/a><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Satisfaction Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>We organize this group to promote innovation, creativity, and the benefits of new technology.

After spending two decades working in the technology industry, Benzi took a step back and reflected on his personal history, steeped in the importance of community. He thought about how technology has tremendous power to bring people together, and yet to date in the food industry, it has largely removed human connections entirely. He decided to focus his next, and most personal venture yet, on using technology to transform the suburban food system, which had become efficient, yet unsustainable and impersonal.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

Chilis on Wheels\u00a0was started on November, 2014\u00a0by Michelle Carrera.\u00a0After searching for a soup kitchen that would serve a vegan Thanksgiving meal and coming up empty, she decided to cook her own chilis and take them directly to people in need of a warm meal. After receiving a lot of support and encouragement from family and friends, and after seeing first hand the need for such a program, she became inspired and committed to bringing vegan food to\u00a0those in need.<\/p> <p>Chilis are distributed once a week\u00a0to people in the street that want a warm homecooked meal. Most soup kitchens close their doors over the weekends, creating a vaccum in services.

George Lucas imagined and created a fantastical world filled with dynamic characters who told the timeless story of the hero\u2019s journey. The costumes shaped the identities of these now famous characters, from the menacing black mask of Darth Vader and the gilded suit of C-3PO, to the lavish royal gowns of Queen Amidala and a bikini worn by Princess Leia when enslaved by Jabba the Hutt.

This will be the first such museum exhibition in the United States in nearly half a century.<\/p> <p>Over the course of his long career, Picasso devoted himself to sculpture wholeheartedly, if episodically, using both traditional and unconventional materials and techniques. Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status for Picasso. He approached the medium with the freedom of a self-taught artist, ready to break all the rules. This attitude led him to develop a deep fondness for his sculptures, to which the many photographs of his studios and homes bear witness. Treating them almost as members of his household, he cherished the sculptures' company and enjoyed re-creating them in a variety of materials and situations. Picasso kept the majority in his private possession during his lifetime. It was only in 1966, through the large Paris retrospective Hommage \u00e0 Picasso, that the public became fully aware of this side of his work. Following that exhibition, in 1967 The Museum of Modern Art organized The Sculpture of Picasso, which until now was the first and only exhibition on this continent to display a large number of the artist\u2019s sculptures.<\/p> <p>Picasso Sculpture focuses on the artist\u2019s lifelong work with sculpture, with a particular focus on his use of materials and processes. The exhibition, which features more than 100 sculptures, complemented by selected works on paper and photographs, aims to advance the understanding of what sculpture was for Picasso, and of how he revolutionized its history through a lifelong commitment to constant reinvention. The exhibition is organized in chapters corresponding to the distinct periods during which Picasso devoted himself to sculpture, each time exploring with fresh intensity the modern possibilities of this ancient art form.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet at a nearby cafe before heading over to the museum.

If you are new, you can meet an expert in your\u00a0field and skip a lot of mistakes just by listening to their experiences.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are many advantages to networking. Here at the NJ Networking Circle we like to keep things fun and innovative. What better way is there to wind down a hard work week then with a little professional party and networking. We like to consider ourselves the transition group because we are not in an up tight work atmosphere, nor is it a full blown out night at the club. You can consider it to be either the cool down of a long week or the warm up to a great weekend; the choice is yours. We just want you to take a load off and have a great time meeting great people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please RSVP the event and post comments or suggestions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJ-Entrepreneur-and-Professional-Networking-Circle\/events\/225893648\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":10800000,"name":"Meeting Of The Minds","id":"225893648","time":1447455600000,"updated":1448643955000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1407589521000,"name":"NJ Entrepreneur and Professional Networking Circle","group_lon":-74.1299972534,"id":16280592,"urlname":"NJ-Entrepreneur-and-Professional-Networking-Circle","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Pioneers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"10037","address_1":"230 5th Ave(Corner 27th street on 5th Ave)","name":"230 Fifth","lon":-73.934448,"id":21431532,"state":"NY","lat":40.817181,"repinned":false},"headcount":650,"distance":5.48748636246,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446183691000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Hello Everyone:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>It's time to announce our next event!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>A Dance Party @ 230 Fifth Featuring Our Alternative Bellydance Show!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>DATE: Friday, November, 13th from 6-11PM<\/b><\/p> <p><b>LOCATION: ***230 FIFTH***<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/5\/c\/600_444045404.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0230 FIFTH (west side of Fifth Avenue between 26th &amp; 27th Streets)<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.230-fifth.com\/\"><b>230 FIFTH.com<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><b>*Dancing to all your favorite tunes with DJ Vinnie Campisi!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.230-fifth.com\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*Drink specials including $6 wine $8 well drinks!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>ADMISSION: FREE!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Also, please join us as Tanna Valentine and I will present our Alternative Bellydance Show.

As symbols of power and money they force you to look upwards and to feel small. But during rainy days they appear to fall down into the puddles forming on the streets. Back then, Weiss took a few pictures of these reflections, in black and white.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When he moved to New York the second time, in 2014, Weiss revisited this theme, photographing the reflections in color, which added an apocalyptic dimension. A closer look at these images yielded a glimpse into another world, with eerie colors, shapes and distortions, caused by the debris, mud, leaves, undercoating, dirt, and wind. Even the reflected people seem to stem from some other place, and some other time. In these images New York is set on fire, with buildings and trees in flames, distorted, falling apart or being flooded.<\/p> <p><i>The exhibition will be on display at Deutsches Haus @ NYU until December 22nd.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>The Artist<\/b><\/p> <p>Hans Weiss is a Vienna based photographer and writer. His fiction and nonfiction books sold more than five million copies and are translated into 17 languages. He received his photographic education at the ICP in 1994\/95, when he was living in New York. In 1997\/98 and 2010\/2011 he attended the School for Art Photography in Vienna, where he enrolled in workshops of Wolfgang Tillmans and various other renowned photographers. His photographic work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions in Germany and Austria and in group exhibitions in Paris, Venice, Salzburg, and Vienna - for example his New York series\u00a0<i>success<\/i>\u00a0at the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg in 2012. His photographic work is mentioned in several professional journals, for instance in <i>Camera Austria<\/i>\u00a0and in\u00a0<i>artmagazine<\/i>.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nA new ebook by Hans Weiss, published in German by Hanser Verlag\/Munich, will be available at the end of November.<\/p> <p>\n\nFor more information and pictures, see<\/p> <p>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hansweiss.com\/\">www.hansweiss.com<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Who is hosting the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Deutsches Haus @ NYU is the host for this event. \u00a0They have staff members on site.

During the Middle Kingdom (mid-Dynasty 11\u2013Dynasty 13, around 2030\u20131650 B.C.), artistic, cultural, religious, and political traditions first conceived and instituted during the Old Kingdom were revived and reimagined. This transformational era is represented through 230 powerful and compelling masterworks (individual objects and groups of objects) in the major international exhibition Ancient Egypt Transformed: The Middle Kingdom, which opened on October 12 at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art. Fashioned with great subtlety and sensitivity, and ranging in size from monumental stone sculptures to delicate examples of jewelry, the works of art are drawn from the preeminent collection of the Metropolitan\u2014which is particularly rich in Middle Kingdom material\u2014and 37 museums and collections in North America and Europe. This is the first comprehensive presentation of Middle Kingdom art and culture and features many objects that have never been shown in the United States.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/a\/d\/3\/600_443263731.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The astonishing continuity of ancient Egyptian culture, with certain basic principles lasting for thousands of years, gives the impression of changelessness,\u201d said Adela Oppenheim, Curator of Egyptian Art. \u201cBut the works of art in the exhibition show that ancient Egypt constantly evolved, and was remarkably flexible within a consistent framework.

Read on for more about some of the exhibitions at the museum and offerings at the market . . .\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/a\/4\/600_444021412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>THE BUILDING<\/p> <p><br\/>Designed by architect Renzo Piano, the new building includes approximately 50,000 square feet of indoor galleries and 13,000 square feet of outdoor exhibition space and terraces facing the High Line.\u00a0An expansive gallery for special exhibitions is approximately 18,000 square feet in area, making it the largest column-free museum gallery in New York City. Additional exhibition space includes a lobby gallery (accessible free of charge), two floors for the permanent collection, and a special exhibitions gallery on the top floor.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to Mr. Piano, \u201cThe design for the new museum emerges equally from a close study of the Whitney\u2019s needs and from a response to this remarkable site. We wanted to draw on its vitality and at the same time enhance its rich character. The first big gesture, then, is the cantilevered entrance, which transforms the area outside the building into a large, sheltered public space. At this gathering place beneath the High Line, visitors will see through the building entrance and the large windows on the west side to the Hudson River beyond. Here, all at once, you have the water, the park, the powerful industrial structures and the exciting mix of people, brought together and focused by this new building and the experience of art.\u201d<\/p> <p>The dramatically cantilevered entrance along Gansevoort Street shelters an 8,500-square-foot outdoor plaza or \u201clargo,\u201d a public gathering space steps away from the southern entrance to the High Line.\u00a0The building also includes an education center offering state-of-the-art classrooms; a multi-use black box theater for film, video, and performance with an adjacent outdoor gallery; a 170-seat theater with stunning views of the Hudson River; and a Works on Paper Study Center, Conservation Lab, and Library Reading Room. The classrooms, theater, and study center are all firsts for the Whitney.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A retail shop on the ground-floor level contributes to the busy street life of the area. A\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/whitney.org\/Visit\/Cafe\">ground-floor restaurant and top-floor cafe<\/a>\u00a0are operated by renowned restaurateur Danny Meyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group.<\/p> <p>Mr. Piano\u2019s design takes a strong and strikingly asymmetrical form\u2014one that responds to the industrial character of the neighboring loft buildings and overhead railway while asserting a contemporary, sculptural presence. The upper stories of the building overlook the Hudson River on its west, and step back gracefully from the elevated High Line Park to its east.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/whitney.org\/MetCollaboration\">plans<\/a>\u00a0to present exhibitions and educational programming at the Whitney\u2019s uptown building for a period of eight years, with the possibility of extending the agreement for a longer term.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/f\/f\/600_444021503.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe Museum will present a career retrospective of Frank Stella (b. 1936), one of the most important living American artists. This survey will be the most comprehensive presentation of Stella\u2019s career to date, showcasing his prolific output from the mid-1950s to the present through approximately 120 works, including paintings, reliefs, maquettes, sculptures, and drawings. Co-organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth and the Whitney, this exhibition will feature Stella\u2019s best-known works alongside rarely seen examples drawn from collections around the world. Accompanied by a scholarly publication, the exhibition will fill the Whitney's entire fifth floor, an 18,000-square-foot gallery that is the Museum\u2019s largest space for temporary exhibitions.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/3\/b\/600_444021563.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Archibald John Motley Jr. (1891\u20131981) was a bold and highly original modernist and one of the great visual chroniclers of twentieth-century American life. He first came to prominence in the 1920s during the early days of the Harlem Renaissance\u2014the cultural flowering of African American art, music, and literature that extended beyond the New York neighborhood of its name to other cities, notably Chicago, where Motley spent most of his life. Motley had a long career and enjoyed recognition for his work early on, yet went through subsequent periods of struggle and obscurity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Motley was born in New Orleans, but his family moved to Chicago when he was quite young, and he later became one of the first black artists to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His training there was academic, rigorously focused on the human figure, and steeped in European tradition. Motley\u2019s sophisticated understanding of art history is especially apparent in his sympathetic portraits, but it was a history that he challenged and advanced with his raucous scenes of everyday urban life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Edward Hopper, Thomas Hart Benton, and Reginald Marsh became much more famous than Motley for their American scenes, he also developed and elucidated his own archetypes of place and people in this country, albeit unapologetically based on African American subject matter. As the work on view in\u00a0Archibald Motley: Jazz Age Modernisteloquently attests, Motley rightly holds a place among the great American modernists. The artist created a far more daring visual language than many of his contemporaries, fusing vivid narrative with dizzying spatial distortion and jarring hues to produce striking settings for characters of diverse racial backgrounds and social classes. And while his portrayals range from serene and august portraits to abrasive or outrageous caricatures, all were his instruments for addressing the poignancy, folly, and complexity of modern life.<\/p> <p><b>Gansevoort Market:<\/b> <img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/9\/8\/600_444021656.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The BRUFFIN is a light and flaky, brioche-like pastry filled with high quality ingredients sourced from around the world to give each one its exclusive character and taste.

We arrived before 6pm and the space looked great (like something you would imagine in Tokyo but without the Asian music at least this time) was busy and seemed to be running perfectly. We tried the black cod, which was very moist and had a very nice miso glaze. We also had miso glazed chicken wings, which were very juicy and tasty, some sushi rolls and tuna and salmon Hakozushi. I've eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants but have never heard of the Hakozushi sushi. It's a square sushi piece with other ingredients and it was very very tasty!

THE OTHER MOZART is based on facts, stories and lines pulled directly from the Mozart family's humorous and heartbreaking letters.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>With the opulent beauty of the dress and hair design, the sweet smell of perfume and the clouds of dusting powder rising from the stage, THE OTHER MOZART is a multi-sensual experience that transports the audience into a world of outsized beauty and delight - but also of overwhelming restrictions and prejudice where, finally, this other Mozart tells her story. Period style movement creates a world of opulence and elegance through articulate delicacy of expressive balletic gestures, reverent court bows, and fan language.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nMusic<\/p> <p>Along with music composed by her famous brother and Marianna Martines (a female composer who inspired Nannerl), the play features original music by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen --- featured composers of the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center, BAM and the International Contemporary Ensemble -- for the instruments Nannerl knew intimately such as clavichords, music boxes and bells, as well as teacups, fans, and other ordinary objects that might have captured her imagination.<\/p> <p>The production features music composed by Nathan Davis\u00a0and Phyllis Chen\u00a0(of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival and the International Contemporary Ensemble) with additional music by Marianna Martines and Wolfgang A. Mozart. Sound design by Nathan Davis. Period style movement directed by Janice Orlandi. Costume design by Magdalena Dabrowska (dress) and Miodrag Guberinic (pannier \/ corset sculpture), with dress concept by Anna Sroka and hair design by Courtney Bednarowski. Lighting design by Joshua Rose.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i>Origins &amp; Performances<\/i><\/p> <p><i>THE OTHER MOZART was developed at the Piccolo Spoleto festival and at the Cherry Lane Theatre\u00a0in NYC as part of the All For One Festival. It was presented at the Berkshire and New Orleans Fringe festivals, at Toronto University and in Munich at the Pasinger Fabrik. The play repeatedly returned to Austria in 2014 at the invitation of the Mozarteum Foundation and Mozarteum University in Salzburg. The play had a critically acclaimed Off-Broadway run at the HERE Arts Center\u00a0in New York City, and in London at St. James Theater. It continues touring internationally.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAwards &amp; Nominations<\/p> <p>THE OTHER MOZART was nominated for the 2015 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Sound Design in a Play and the 2015 Off Broadway Alliance Award for Best Solo Performance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The play was nominated for eight New York Innovative Theatre Awards:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Solo Performance - Sylvia Milo,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Director - Isaac Byrne,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Costume Design - Magdalena Dabrowska &amp; Miodrag Guberinic,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Set Design - Anna Sroka,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Sound Design - Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Music - Phyllis Chen &amp; Nathan Davis,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Original Full-length script - Sylvia Milo and\u00a0<\/p> <p>Outstanding Premiere Production of a Play,\u00a0<\/p> <p>winning Outstanding Solo Performance and Outstanding Original Music.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Press &amp; Articles<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.broadwayworld.com\/off-broadway\/article\/Samantha-Hoefer-to-Share-Lead-Role-in-THE-OTHER-MOZART-Off-Broadway-Starting-1024-20151020\">Broadway World<\/a> (event description largely from here).<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2015\/sep\/08\/lost-genius-the-other-mozart-sister-nannerl\">The Guardian<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/01\/theater\/the-other-mozart-at-here-arts-center.html?_r=2\">The New York Times<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-big-stars-of-experimental-theater-1402970184\">The Wall Street Journal<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theothermozart.com\/\">Official Page<\/a>\u00a0(see for more articles)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nYou must pay your tickets at using the link provided above.

It has been called Akasha, Logos, the primordial OM, the music of the spheres, the Higgs field, dark energy, and a thousand other names throughout history. The vibratory field is at the root of all true spiritual experience and scientific investigation. It is the same field of energy that saints, Buddhas, yogis, mystics, priests, shamans and seers, have observed by looking within themselves. Many of history's monumental thinkers, such a Pythagoras, Kepler, Leonardo DaVinci, Tesla, and Einstein, have come to the threshold of this great mystery.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

Mastodons (not to be confused with woolly mammoths) are large, elephant-like creatures that roamed forested lands and swamps on every continent on Earth except Antarctica and Australia, during the Pleistocene Epoch, approximately 28 million to 8 thousand years ago. In Staten Island and New Jersey, the remains of these 6-ton vegetation-browsing beasts have been found in several localities, as teeth, tusks, and bones. Come see what these creatures and other mega-fauna from the Ice Age looked like, discover how they lived, what they ate, and speculate on how they all died out, or did they? New scientific research has provided an opportunity to perhaps revive some of these formerly\"extinct\" beasts.

We will have a presentation on the subject followed by an open discussion. Come share your thoughts and ideas on this important topic. \u201cCan you make me understand why you have brushed woman into the background of your lives \u2013although women around the Prophet and his Companions took part in so grand a manner in the life of their men?\u201d \u2013Muhammad Asad<\/p> <p>There is considerable evidence in the books of Hadith that substantiate the claim that segregation of women did not exist during the time of the Prophet (PBUH). A Hadith reported in the Book of Muslim, for instance, states that Umm Hisham, daughter of Haritha, who was the son of Ne\u2019man said: \u201cI memorized sura Qaf from hearing it from Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) because he used to recite it during his khutbah on Fridays.\u201d<\/p> <p>Similarly, Ibn Abbas, the paternal cousin of Muhammad (PBUH), reported that \u201cA beautiful woman, from among the most beautiful of women, used to pray behind the Prophet (PBUH).\u201d This Hadith was narrated by Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud, Attayalisy, Baihaqi, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nasai and others. It was judged authentic by Sheikh Al-Albaanee in his book, Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth (Saheehah #2472), where he quoted many scholars who determined it to be true.<\/p> <p>The exclusion and seclusion of women in Muslim communities is based on custom and culture rather than on Islam. With the passage of time, culture and religion have become so intertwined as to be virtually inextricable. However, it is time for these archaic and destructive traditions to change. As Muhammad Asad writes, \u201cneither in the Quran, nor in the life example of the Prophet do we find any warrant for these practices, which later found [their] way into Muslim society from Byzantium.\u201d<\/p> <p>We will have some light foods and a discussion after the film.

They regularly teach workshops in their home town of Buenos Aires and in the international festivals and events. Their kindness and good sense of humor make the learning very effective for the students. Gustavo is patient and reflective, Mar\u00eda brings dynamism and clarity in the concepts. They are especially known for their musicality, agility and elegant, but playful style of social dance. Maria's lightening-fast feet will AMAZE you, and if you've never seen Gustavo's \"milonga moonwalk,\" get ready! Gustavo stands out for his elegance, creativity and musicality, and Mar\u00eda for her quick adornments and her musical precision. Together they also work hard on promoting the Tango as a culture. Gustavo has written several books (all of them translated into different languages) and with Mar\u00eda they\u2019ve produced instructional dvds on techniques for leaders and followers as well as a documentary on the history of the dance in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, that they screen with educational purposes. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tangosalon.com.ar\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tangosalon.com.ar\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tangosalon.com.ar\/<\/a><\/a> I hope you make it!<\/p> <p><br\/>Check also<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dancetango.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dancetango.com<\/a> and<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=26590514004\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=26590514004<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyorktango\/events\/226415605\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"Friday Tango with MARIA OLIVERA & GUSTAVO BENZECRY @ La Milonga Rosa","id":"xsddnytpbrb","time":1447461000000,"updated":1447472884000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1137554125000,"name":"New York Tango","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":220275,"urlname":"newyorktango","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Tango Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"14 Memorial Hwy","name":"Alvin & Friends Restaurant","lon":-73.782524,"id":23379792,"lat":40.909119,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.475484848,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446675966000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us for an beautiful evening of fine dining and tango dancing accompanied by a rare collection of vintage videos from the the golden era of tango.

Friday Night Blues was ROARING last week! We had so many great people come out, both experienced and new. Let's keep the trend going with our Friday the 13th party!<\/p> <p>If you're superstitious, you might think that Friday the 13th is bad luck. But we believe that you can make your own luck: being out on a Friday night, with your friends, and dancing... it's a recipe for GOOD luck! Arm yourself with four leaf clovers, rabbits feet, horseshoes, your lucky dance shoes... anything you need to prove that a little superstition is no match for us dancers. So let's get a resounding \"HECK YES!!\" and bring the good luck to Stepping Out this week!<\/p> <p>The Intermediate series for the month of November is called \"BulletproofYour Dancing.\" This week, we'll be learning about \"Posture and Grounding\":<\/p> <p><i>Proper posture and grounding are essential to the blues aesthetic. Come explore the intricate details of these fundamental concepts, and learn how they can transform your dance!<\/i><\/p> <p>Stepping Out Studios is a beautiful space on the 9th floor. To get buzzed in, dial 9 and the green call button on the key pad to the right of the building entrance.<\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>SCHEDULE:<\/p> <p>8:30pm-9:30pm - Fundamentals Lesson w\/ George<\/p> <p>8:30pm-9:30pm - Intermediate Lesson w\/ Laura<\/p> <p>9:30pm-1:00am - DJ\u2019d Dance<\/p> <p><br\/>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>Before you come in, it\u2019s a great idea to take a look at this Etiquette Document that our community has compiled:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bluesdancenewyork.com\/etiquette\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bluesdancenewyork.com\/etiquette\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bluesdancenewyork.com\/etiquette<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>The lesson costs $10, and the dance is $12. But if you pay for both at the same time, it's just $20 for the night!<\/p> <p>If you volunteer, your admission to the dance is free for the night. Email [masked] if you want to be added to the list.<\/p> <p>Bring dance shoes with slippery soles (for easy turning), or socks, especially when wet outside.<\/p> <p>All ages. No bar, but it is BYOB. Water is provided.<\/p> <p>There is no dress code, but hygiene is important and dressing up a bit is a nice thing to do. Prioritize comfort and ability to move!<\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:<\/p> <p>Fundamentals (8:30pm-9:30pm):<\/p> <p>Fundamentals classes are for students new to blues dance and experienced students looking to hone their blues dance fundamentals. We cover how to connect with the music, how to connect with a partner, and have a rotating set of material to introduce students to important concepts in blues partner dance. These classes will give you everything you need to know to have a successful dance, and whet your appetite for more!<\/p> <p><br\/>Intermediate (8:30pm-9:30pm**):<\/p> <p>Intermediate series are technique-based classes designed to build specific knowledge and skills in students with prior blues dance experience. Intermediate classes are aimed to expand your knowledge depth in a specific topic of blues vocabulary through body awareness and historical context. Ultimately, taking class is your vehicle to having even more fun on the dance floor!<\/p> <p>**Please plan to arrive on time. After 15 minutes have passed, students are no longer allowed to enter class.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BluesDanceNewYork\/events","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Friday-Night-Blues-NYC\/events\/226600195\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Friday Night Blues","id":"hcnxllytpbrb","time":1447464600000,"updated":1447478429000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446516679000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19085086,"urlname":"Friday-Night-Blues-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"352 7th Avenue","name":"Mustang Harry's","lon":-73.992928,"id":15378682,"state":"NY","lat":40.74818,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.19875010848,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446763297000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Prepay is required at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5919\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5919\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5919<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>*This is a weekenddating.com organized event*<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Date &amp; Time:\u00a0<\/b><b>Friday, November 13, 2015<br\/>8:30 PM-10:00 PM<\/p> <p>Male ages: 43-58<br\/>Female ages: 41-53<\/p> <p>Location:\u00a0Mustang Harrys (by Penn Station)<br\/>352 7th Avenue<br\/>New York, NY 10036<\/p> <p>Cost:\u00a0$35.75<\/p> <p>Description:\u00a0Speed Dating- Up to 15 dates in one night!

If you are planning on hunting in Minnewaska this season will we be stopping to get permits at the park office. You will need to have already purchased your current year NYS hunting license to get a Minnewaska Permit. They need to see your back tag #. We will be able to stop at a Dick's Sporting Goods on the way to purchase hunting licenses if needed.
